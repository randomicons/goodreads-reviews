0,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"I’m going to do something that's a little disrespectful and start this review by talking about another fantasy series that I’ve enjoyed: A Song of Ice and Fire. That series rules. It has everything I’ve wanted in a series since Tolkien but there’s one thing to be said about it, neither good or bad, that is a big part of its impact: it is dark, very very dark. The darkness comes, as it should in all quality fiction, not necessarily from the actual bad things that happen to good people, but from t"
1,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"Anton Chekhov famously said that if an author mentions a gun, it had better go off at some point, a point often attributed to Raymond Chandler (who at least practiced this rule). The same goes for fantasy writers. Fantasy doesn't need to be all blood and whirling blades, but if a fantasy writer straps a broadsword to a character's side, it had better be drawn in anger, at some point. This was one of the best fantasy novels I've read in a while, especially impressive as it's a first novel. It has"
2,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"I was up until half five yesterday morning reading intensely to finish off this story. I didn't write the review then as it would have been a tired, mumbled mess with little to no eloquence and it wouldn't have included any cool sounding words. Let's see how I get on now after a good nights sleep. Prior to reading this, I had completed Abercrombie's Shattered Sea trilogy and enjoyed it a lot. Where that was classic story focused fantasy with twists aplenty, this is best described as a macabre, d"
3,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,3,"Originally reviewed at Bookwraiths Reviews As I’ve mentioned in other reviews, Joe Abercrombie is a fantasy author who all my real-life friends have raved about for years and insisted that I read. From their proselyting, it seemed that my life would not be complete without sampling Lord Grimdark’s wares. So, in order to save myself from some accursed fate, I read the first two novels in Abercrombie’s Shattered Sea series. Unfortunately, grimwhine was not for me. If interested in the “why”, you ca"
4,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,3,"So this was one of my most anticipated reads. Grimdark fans from all over offer up this book as one of the best in the genre, and so that understandably rocketed my expectations! And this was not a bad book by any means. In fact, as soon as I started I was told multiple times that I could liken the first book of The First Law series to ""a giant prologue,"" and I think that's a really accurate way to describe it. The book follows a handful of characters who are all entangled in some way in the dege"
5,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,1,"I almost put down the book when 3 paragraphs in the first 3 pages began with some version of this line: ""Shit,"" he said. But I managed to slog through because I was told this was a some genre-breaking novel that didn't rely so heavily on typical fantasy clichés and it was supposed to be really dark and gritty. Instead of gritty, it felt kind of like a teenager who swears a lot to try and sound like an adult: really forced and usually out of context. A lot of the writing in general seemed to trip o"
6,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"""So, let's cast the characters for our novel, shall we?"" ""Of course, boss, Mr. Abercrombie, sir!"" ""Where is the run-of-a-mill farmboy with a great destination?"" ""I'm afraid he ran of the mill, met a goblin. Now rots in a ditch."" ""Oh, how unfortunate."" ""Indeed, boss, indeed."" ""Let's see. What about the maiden fair in need of rescue from a dragon?"" ""Apparently she ate the dragon. Now she was saying something about a burning sensation in the...well...digesting area. Went to the toilet, never saw her again"
7,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"Joe Abercrombie certainly knows how to write some disturbingly likable characters. In any other book the protagonists would be the bad guys. Logan Ninefingers is a brutal warrior who goes into insane blood rages where he kills anything, and everything, near him. Yet, weirdly, he is also a wise and sensitive soul. San Dan Glocka is a torturer whose heart is pure malice, yet somehow his attitude toward life boarders on the hilarious. These two are such great characters; they make the series what i"
8,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"The Blade Itself will undoubtedly become classic fantasy. I found it engrossing, and one of the best examples of the ""darker"" epic fantasies, with protagonists lacking in traditional heroic qualities and quests that are less than selfless. I liked the way the story was constructed, primarily following three main characters, with a fourth was added partway through the book. I was fairly certain they would intersect at some point, so part of the interest in the story is seeing how their individual"
9,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"4.5/5 Stars I started reading this because a lot of my friends recommend me if I wanted something like Song of Ice & Fire series, this is the closest one, and imo they're right. This book follows the perspective of 3 main anti-heroes, believe me, you'll root for them when you read it. Logen Ninefinger, the Schizophrenia barbarian, Sand dan Glokta, once the best swordsman turned crippled and torturer and Jezal dan Luthar, the narcissistic fencer who wanted nothing more than fame. The book start"

11,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"On the run from a king he once served, barbarian Logen Ninefingers finds himself in the Union's capital, aligned with Bayaz, a legendary wizard long thought dead. Meanwhile, nobleman Captain Jezal Luthar trains for The Contest, a fencing spectacle, while lusting after Ardee West, sister of one of his comrades. Inquistor Glokta, crippled former swordsman, skulks around in the darkness, torturing the answers he seeks while searching for treason at every turn. What is Bayaz planning? Will Jezal bed"
12,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"I can certainly say that this book is gritty. So, you start reading it and it pushes your face in mud, sweat and blood. If someone just falls somewhere or rolls down the stairs, you can be sure, it will be shown with all the glory of sticky stuff running down the face with an agonizing squirm. It reminds me of Tolkien or Sapowski in some episodes. But this book is not just a merciless hole covered in darkness and blood. You can find a lot of fun, humor (slight or hard)and that just makes the book"
13,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"It's been a while since I read a fantasy trilogy all the way through, back to back. Joe Abercrombie's The First Law series was too compelling not to finish in a single marathon. The first book, The Blade Itself, introduces a cast of well-developed, complex characters throw together in a world loosely based on medieval Europe. At first, it's not entirely clear what the major story line will be. It's also not clear who the good guys and bad guys are -- kind of like real life. If this sounds like A"
14,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"I'll start this review by saying that, currently, I have 197 Goodreads friends (which is really something, as I doubt there are even 50 people in my real life that I can stand). Out of those 197 friends, 59 of them have either read this book, or have it on their to-read shelf. That's 30%. Pretty much one in three. Numbers don't lie; they can't. So I doubt I'll be introducing the concept of Mr. Abercrombie's genius to anyone. In fact, this would be pretty much the perfect example of ""preaching to"

16,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,*** 4.75 *** A buddy re-read with my friends from BB&B Just as great as the first time around:-)
17,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"6.0 stars (One of My All Time Favorites). Absolutely outstanding debut novel. Right along side The Lies of Locke Lamora by Scott Lynch and The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss as the best debut Fantasy novels of the last few years. This book is as good as the fantasy genre gets and I can not wait to read the sequel. Finally, IMHO, Glotka is one of the most original and best developed characters in a long time. Highly recommended. Nominee: John A. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Novel (2008)"
18,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"Distrustful The Blade Itself is the first book of the First Law Trilogy, which is an epic supernatural fantasy adventure. It can’t be helped to compare the trilogy to the Song of Ice and Fire (Game of Thrones) series in its depth of detail, its rollcall of wonderful characters, hidden plots and agendas, and fantasy dimensions. The world of Joe Abercrombie it told in superb vivid detail where multiple cultures and nations are warring and untrustworthy of the other but there is the darker menace"
19,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"Actual rating : 4.5 stars Back when I was in college and had to read a tons of French classics, I considered my dearly fantasy books as my escape, and I used to devour them all, good or bad, whenever I had the opportunity. Sadly, what had to happen finally happened : I grew tired of them, and spent years avoiding them, until a little bastard named Jorg came along in February, and then I thought : FUCK YEAH. There are still fantasy books I can enjoy. The Blade Itself is one of them. If I can't deny"
20,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"March 2016 Reread done and stars re-awarded. *high-fives Abercrombie This book sucker punched me. I did not expect this level of awesomeness. I did initially give this 5 stars due to superb characters, but downgraded it after some consideration regarding the plot. I know Lord Grimdark is a very popular author, but I had tried one of his books a few years back and did not care for it as much as this one. It was good, but that was just where it stopped for me. This book though, hit all the right not"
21,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,3,"Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || Pinterest Hilariously, I read THE BLADE ITSELF alongside SUMMER OF THE UNICORN , and while both are fantasy novels, just look at those covers and guess who the targeted audience for each is . Yeah, I thought so. Now imagine THE BLADE ITSELF with a hero (let's go with Bayaz) and a heroine (Ferro?) clad in scanty clothes, miming sexual positions around a sword plunged into the middle of a scenic wood populated by deer...and Shanka. This NEEDS to happen! My"
22,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,1,"I tried to read this book. I really did. I got over halfway through, but I just can't go any further. It's too damn boring and pointless. I hate every character in it. I'm not interested in what's going on in the slightest. I keep making excuses not to read any more of it. A good story is about interesting people doing interesting things. And this one lacked both of those things. I should never have to force myself to keep reading, I should be excited and compelled to read by what's going on and"
23,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"Life—the way it really is—is a battle not between good and bad, but between bad and worse.’ Joseph Brodsky I know I would love this book when I read the synopsis,and am glad this book lived up to expectations.Never have I seen grey characters portrayed perfectly, the characters are so amiable that its easy to overlook their morals. The book is also original, well written battle scenes, cultures, good dose of romance, diversity etc. World building and Writing I always appreciate a good world build"
24,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,2,"1 1/2 I had avoided this book for awhile, despite all the good things I'd heard about it, primarily because I was afraid that the ""gritty realism"" proclaimed about in the book amounted to ""bleak and disheartening"". I read for entertainment, and I don't read to be depressed about the darker parts of human nature, because I'm quite familiar with them already, quite frankly, and so I saw this book and thought ""not for me"". But, still, when you see a book recommended by, seemingly, everyone, time and"
25,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"It’s been a long time that I’m anticipating to start reading Abercrobie’s books, because they sound very appealing to me. To my surprise I didn’t find it dark nor grim as I thought, there’s lots of good humor and the atmosphere is relatively “calm” without any imminent cataclysm, or a world in the brink of total destruction. The world changes, but it looks like that it would take some time until we’ll witness dramatic changes in the world. As I see it, it’s more *light* fantasy than dark fantasy"

When he receives a message that a powerful wizards looks for him, he decides to take a job even without having a clue what the said job is about. In the southern capital of the Union (this is the name of a kingdom) a crippled inquisitor Glokta does his job - a little too enthusiastically.

27,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"TLDR part, before review: I recommend to read First Law from Book 1 (The Blade Itself) to Book 3 (Last Argument of Kings) as soon as possible. There are details from Book 1 that still relevant until the end of Book 3. And it is basically one book in three volumes. I perceived some reviewers that only read the first book only rated lower ratings, because the story at the end of Book 1 is not finished. Now, the review... I praise this low-fantasy series, because the unusual POV characters. Most of th"
28,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"The whole book was great, but the last 7 chapters were f*cking GOLD!! If all grimdark is this funny I need more of it in my life. I laughed, I cried, I shit my pants... What more could you ask for??"
30,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"This is definitely one of those awesome non-typical fantasy novel, there's no knight in shining armor, there's no maniacally laughing villain, there's no battle of good against evil, and I honestly still have no idea what the hell is going on! Some art from the series comic adaptation Even though this book read more like a giant prologue than an actual installment of its own, I loved it to pieces.. Yes, it was slow at times, yes you feel like nothing much has happened overall, but damn it if those"
31,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"The book that made me read it until two hours after midnight, and I had to wake up at five because I had to go to work. Trust me when the book drew you into the story, you certainly will not stop reading. The story is great and just drew me to read it. Even though I was short of time to read, I used every moment of my free time to read it until the end. Writer Joe Abercrombie in this book collected the troupe of characters who are literally not just ordinary. From the very first magician Bayaz w"
32,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"When it comes to an epic tale with moral clarity set in a supremely realised fantasy world, he (Tolkien) pretty much knocked it out of the park. But that means there’s not much point in my writing it again, is there? Forgive me for saying so, but it feels as if folk have been writing Lord of the Rings again for a while now, and I think we could probably, you know, stop. - Joe Abercrombie, ""Bankrupt Nihilism"" blog The above quote is the author's response to a columnist's criticism that his work"
33,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"ORIGINALLY POSTED AT Fantasy Literature . I started reading Joe Abercrombie's debut novel immediately after finishing a very popular old 1970s classic post-Tolkien fantasy that had left me -- quite frankly -- bored. I had the flu, my body ached, and I was feeling sorry for myself. But by the end of the first chapter of The Blade Itself, I was feeling much better. First, Mr. Abercrombie's writing was vivid, tense, action-packed, and droll -- just the way I like it. Second, I found myself thankful t"
34,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"Buddy read with the great guys from FBR!! My first Grimdark! A bloody gritty story set in a violent world and centred around 5 anti-heroes. Glokta - a tortured crippled war hero turned torturer for the King's inquisition Logen - a northern barbarian and infamous warrior, looking for a purpose and escape from a dark past Bayaz - a mysterious powerful mage Jezal - a vain and uptight nobleman and famous fencer (whom I really cannot stand) and Ferro - a dark skinned warrior woman and former slave with a t"
35,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"Here is the background: there was a rumor that said that Abercrombie’s books start with the weakest and grow. I guess I am odd that way. Because I actually loved this first installment. The skill of an author to slowly unfold the story, the factions, political complexities in a city and outside. The ability to use characters that you see in many books and make them relatable. The ability to create one or two unique characters, and make them incredibly unique. Finally, the audiobook was extremely"
36,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"If you're into stuff like this, you can read the full review. Non-Standard Fantasy: “The Blade Itself” by Joe Abercrombie I ""discovered"" Abercrombie in 2012 when I was actually looking for some fantasy novels that ""weren't Dragonlance-level shit"". Back in 2012 I started off by reading “The Heroes” first. Only in 2013 I got to reading the First Law from the beginning. Abercrombie does not sugar-coat his narrative. That’s for sure. That’s the first indication you’re not reading your running-of-the-m"
37,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,3,"I am trying to figure out what this book is missing for me. There's nothing that makes me angry about it, there's plenty to like. And yet, still, although I read it and mostly enjoyed it, the first half of the book is already fading in my mind, and I don't see any reason to ever re-read it. I'll probably read the rest in the series, and this is perfectly competent fantasy. It's just not...enough. Note: The rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the changes in Goodreads policy and enforceme"
38,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"Logen Ninefingers is a barbarian from the rugged Northern country. He is content with nothing more than living to see another day. Everyone he cares about is dead. Inquisitor Glokta is 30 but you'd think he's 90. Hunched, crippled, in constant pain - Glokta shuffles through this story like an old man. He was tortured for 2 years in the Emperor's prisons, and now he tortures people himself for the Union. He is bitter, angry, tenacious and cynical.

42,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"Holy foul-mouthed, freaking God, where the hell has Joe Abercrombie been all my life? This is different from any other fantasy story I've ever read and I F*@#ing loved it. From Logan ""Bloody Nine"" to my favorite character, Glotka, Abercrombie just killed it, both figuratively and literally. It's fantasy turned on its head and having its throat slit. Dark, violent, foul and soooooooooooooo much fun."
43,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"Executive Summary: I really enjoyed the book, but it felt mostly like setup for the rest of the series. Most trilogies at least have some short-term goal accomplished in each book, but I felt like that was missing here. Full Review One of the very first things Good Reads recommended me to was this book. Well this and Gardens of the Moon . I ignored both books until convinced otherwise by friends of mine. Apparently good reads recommendation engine knows what it's talking about, and I shouldn't ign"
44,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"This book came complete with a plethora of glowing reviews and commendations. Fortunately, for once, these seem to have been well founded. The Blade Itself brings a sense of awe to the table, something sorely lacking in contemporary fantasy. Of course, there are many, many books that I still have to read.... I'm very much a supporter of old school fantasy and this novel seems to be a happy meeting of 'modern' and 'classical'. What makes this novel especially appealing are the characters, and specif"
45,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,3,"Sometimes, you just need to curl up under the duvet with a mug of Lempsip and some epic fantasy. This one did the job nicely. The characters are all, objectively speaking, dislikable people but enjoyable for all that, in a Blackadder kind of way – I had fun casting them in my head. The writing style is blunt and efficient, with an identifiably British tone leavening the ‘grim darkness’: a strain of dark wit, and frequent uses of the interjection ‘Er—’, suggest that Terry Pratchett and PG Wodehou"
46,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,3,"The Blade Itself never really managed to grip me. I only cared for Glokta. I wasn't interested in any of the other characters and wasn't sure what the plot tried to do...I'm almost worried to admit that yes, I was bored. I've been told that this is a difficult/unfortunate start to an otherwise amazing series and I must say I am tempted to read the remaining books. Maybe, if I like them, I'll try this one again afterwards, just to see how it holds up once I've seen the entire story unfold. Perhaps"

You really never know what to expect within it pages. I didn't even read the synopsis, I just jumped into it and was Blown Away.

50,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"I was very impressed by the immersion into the characters and the unconventional choice of the Inquisitor. Everyone grew on me, including him. The setting was beautifully illustrated and I genuinely think that the build-up to an epic battle was smooth as silk. It didn't feel contrived or hacked. It felt inevitable. The hints at great workings of power and magic were truly enticing. That being said, it's obviously a part of a greater work of fiction, and there weren't any major plot advances in th"
51,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"I loved this book!!! The narrator, Steven Pacey, was brilliant and the story itself was excellent. I loved the touches of humour which made me laugh out loud and some of the characterisation was just superb. All of the main characters are damaged in some way, some of them are just plain evil, and yet we also see their good sides and in the end there are no goodies and baddies, just people. By the end of the book there is no choice by but to move on to the next in the series because you just have"

53,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"4.5/5 Joe Abercrombie, the Lord of Grimdark, is a fantastic author. I've been trying to get started in this series for quite a while now, as a fan of fantasy and grimdark alike, but it's dry beginning really took a while to stick with me. I picked it up and put it down several times over the past year, in favor of more exciting and fantastical reads that I just had to get to. I won't lie. Reading this before/after some pretty amazing reads made it all the more challenging. But I'm glad I finished."
54,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"“How’s the book?” asked Jezal. “The Fall of the Master Maker, in three volumes. They say it’s one of the great classics of history. Lot of boring rubbish,” she snorted derisively. “Full of wise Magi, stern knights with mighty swords and ladies with mightier bosoms. Magic, violence and romance, in equal measure. Utter shit.” Say one thing for Abercrombie, say he knows how to make fun of his own trilogy. We can of course add to this rather brief summary with bloody barbarians, an unhuman hoard, spir"
55,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"Oops! Apparently I forgot to write a review for this & went straight on to the next book. I just finished it. Both were excellent. It's a fairly standard fantasy world with magical magic, although there are some real limits & hints of better rules. What makes this so good are the characters & the politics. The politics are basically straight forward at first blush. The nobles are spoiled jerks & everyone is out for themselves. There are some hints, but they don't really evolve unt"
56,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"This is a prime slice of grimdark fantasy. It’s important to state that right away – if you like your fantasy light where, to quote Oscar Wilde, the good end happily, the bad unhappily, than don’t bother; this book is not for you. If however you like fantasy harsh and uncompromising, the darkness occasionally lightened by flashes of the blackest humour, than I think you might well enjoy this. Although the overarching plot is clearly that of a trilogy (the feeling of threads coming together, the"
57,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,3,"Confession Time: Epic fantasy is not one of my go-to genres. While I can appreciate the appeal of escaping into a medieval world filled with knights and wizards and a veritable smörgåsbords of mystical creatures, for me, there was always some disconnect which prevented me from fully immersing into those types of stories. I read a few Arthurian tales, as a child, but I ventured no further. I never played Dungeons & Dragons, World of Warcraft, or any of those big fantasy games. With the immense"
58,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"Rating 4.5 Great first book! STILL WORKING ON THE REVIEW- so little time, better spent on reading Damn, another great dark/epic fantasy series. It is just the first book, but I just know I'm gonna love the other books in the series. I love a great anti-hero, and this book has more than one. Let's face it, the only characters that seem guilt-free (for now) are... ""Erm...""

59,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"I rarely re-read books as I feel like there's a lot out there still to read. But i do re-read books that leave a lasting impression on me. The Blade itself offered a unique reading experience first time reading it introducing striking characters like Glokta, Logen Nine-fingers, West, Bayaz, Jezal, Dogman and Ferro. It felt very refreshing to be back in Joe Abercrombie's grim world with these guys."
61,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"This was a fantastic book which only missed the five star mark due to the lack of a proper ending. It's a major pet peeve of mine but didn't bother me as much as it usually does. It wasn't a cliffhanger ending, it didn't just stop, but it didn't really resolve as such. I'm looking forward to the next in the series. I've seen a few discussions lately about the definition of ""dark fantasy"" and for me, this is it. It was dark and gritty and violent and more than a few scenes stayed with me long afte"
62,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,3,3.5 stars. It was definitely a slow burn but I can tell great things will come of this series
63,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"I’m glad I finally got a chance to start this series and what a beginning this is. I’ve read Heroes and it was wonderful to go back to the start and see how these characters were first introduced. Warning – Swears ahead. So normally I’m a bit of a plot fiend. I need it, want it, got to got to have it. So it was a surprise when I found myself two hundred pages in and thought ‘hang on what’s actually going on in this thing”. Quick check of the blurb revealed it was about four major characters and I"
64,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,It's been a long time since one book grabbed me so hard from the very beginning. So hard that when I wasn't reading it I was thinking about it. These days it's extremely hard for me to read a book within a month because free time isn't the commodity that comes easy but I've been under a spell last ten days and to be completely honest I'm still under it. Of course I have to continue with the next part of the trilogy. I predict a few sleepless nights an dozing off at lunch breaks for sure. This bo
65,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"A political drama with a lot of power games and surplus of graphic violence . There is very little magic and the plot is more character driven . It is reminiscent of Quentin Tarantino films with its dark story , humor and shady characters . "" You carry on . That's what he'd always done . That's the task that comes with surviving , whether you deserve to live or not . You remember the dead as best as you can . You say some words for them . Then you carry on , and you hope for better ."" Before I"
66,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,3,"This book was like watching someone setting up a chess board very, very slowly and methodically. And for most of its length, that's what it was, getting all the characters where they needed to be so that their journey could begin. It wasn't until late in the narrative, when all of the pieces were in place, when the opening moves finally happened, that it truly became an exciting read. The stakes weren't known early enough to really drive the book forward. A true sense of the mysteries of this un"
67,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,3,"The writing was great, but I just never could get into it, really. I don't know why I got so bogged down. I'll definitely give Abercrombie another go though, because I did like his style even if I didn't love the story."
68,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,1,"If you're serious about good fiction and are educated in storytelling, don't believe all of the praise for ""The Blade Itself."" Abercrombie's trilogy has been getting a lot of buzz in fantasy circles. Most readers call it ""unconventional fantasy,"" the back cover of my edition calls it ""noir fantasy,"" and the loftiest of readers call it ""literary fantasy."" I don't find any of these terms oxymoronic--but they are all applied incorrectly to this book. ""The Blade Itself"" is as uninteresting and cliche"
69,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"Exceptionally original Characters. Self-driven plot with parallel awesome story-lines. Simple in structure yet deep in essence. From the very beginning through out the book, the reader lays on his nerves waiting for the moment our heroes are banded in a party to embark on their expected ""Epic-Journey"" and you just wish that Bayaz joins in. P.S. Looking forward to reading the entire series and this is one of the very few books that regardless of how long you read, you just want to go on and on. Gl"
70,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"Great book with a stellar ending. Most of the book was character setup and plot setup but the writing was great and it was very enjoyable even when things were just calmly moving along. There are a handful of main characters and they're so well developed that I loved them all without the usual preference for some and waning interest when hearing about others. When we get to the end however, things are turned up some serious notches and it goes nuclear awesome. Very much looking forward to the ne"
71,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"This was simply an amazing book, made even more so by the reading in the Audible version by Steven Pacey. His ability to change voice for each character was fascinating, and really added to the presentation of the entire story. I had no problem differentiating between the main characters, and the supporting characters, as well. It was amazing to hear him switch between all of the accents necessary for the characters and where they were from. While this is set in a fantasy world, depending upon t"
72,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"The First Law trilogy has been re-released with new covers and The Blade Itself is currently on sale for $2.99 across all ebook sites. More on these new covers at B&N's SFF blog: https://www.barnesandnoble.com/blog/s... I'm not feeling these new covers. They look too modern, like generic suspense thriller with a military spin and a little like Jason Bourne meets Black Hawk Down. The main thing here is they don't look like at all fantasy to me. But maybe that's the look the publisher is goi"
74,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"5 Stars to one of the best debut fantasy novels I have read in a long time. I really enjoyed this one, and sad I put it off for so long. It was extremely entertaining and the writing is unbelievably good. I will say that this one is not for the faint of heart. One of the main characters (and probably my very favorite) is a torturer and there are some torture scenes, but for the most part it's done tactfully. But be warned, there will be blood. There is also some severe language and the setting i"
75,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"I honestly can't remember who recommended this series to me but, whoever it was, if you're reading this: THANK YOU! I absolutely loved this book. Great characters, plenty of action, an intriguing plot, great dialogue and, best of all, some great world-building. I'm completely hooked and can't wait to start book two..."
76,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"Read the full review on impressionblend.com ...What's interesting about The Blade Itself is how character-driven the entire novel is. While there are a few important events throughout the story, what the readers will remember most are the characters, and believe me when I tell you that the crippled torturer is going to be your favorite. Glokta's perspective is very unusual, and saying he is a morally gray character barely scratches the surface—comparing what he says to what he doesn't say was o"
79,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"Wow, what a brilliant book. I came into the First Law trilogy excepting more grit, and grimdark themes than I'm used to which was definitely fulfilled, but there was so much more. Joe Abercrombie quickly presented view point characters all very distinguishable, and all that I loved to read. I was equally excited for chapters from Logen, Jezal, Ferra, and Glokta (especially Glokta) which is rare in books, I'd say. Another aspect of the novel that caught me off guard was the humor. So much sarcasm"
80,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"I am so happy to finally review a book I've been reading over quite a long time. The First Law series is a fantasy series that has the same fascination for me that GRR Martin sparked with his 'A Song of Ice and Fire' series. The world building is insanely good. The mythology of the world is fascinating and, by the end of book 1, not yet fully revealed. 'The Blade Itself' introduces a brilliant set of characters who tell the story through their own - and beautifully unique - POVs: Logen Ninefingers"
82,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"All hail Joe Abercrombie, my new favorite King of Grit. The Blade Itself is a great start to a promising trilogy that I know I will re-read in the future. If you are a fantasy fan and haven't read Abercrombie's stuff, then you are really missing out. Joe Abercrombie immerses the reader into a truly gritty fantasy setting. When I say ""immerses"" I mean that he pours a cauldron of blood down your throat while ripping off your toenails. These books are not for the faint of heart. I actually felt my s"
84,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"Judging solely from the description on the back, I'm not sure I would have commited to reading this. But, it came with a glowing recommendation from a friend and I'm glad I listened. The novel is just well written, and while its not entirely surprising, it is exciting. Abercrombie writes action scenes vividly, succinctly, and deftly avoids the laziness some writers fall prey to. I'll be reading the second book right away."
85,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"This is a series I’ve been meaning to start for a while for two reasons. The first being it was the one that hooked one of my friends into fantasy reading, the second that I heard fans of Mark Lawrence’s work would enjoy Abercrombie’s. I have to say this was a good read. The Blade Itself starts off with a literal cliff-hanger that sets the stage for the tense and dramatic novel that follows. Having read Mark Lawrence’s Prince of Thorns earlier this year, I was expecting a dark and gritty novel, w"
86,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"I usually prefer stand-alone books, or series that take place with the same characters or setting but don't leave you hanging at the end of the book. The kind of SF&F series that I like include The Dresden Files by Jim Butcher, The Company by Kage Baker, and Charles deLint's Newford stories. I have to say that The Blade Itself isn't like any of these. It's also not like series that go on and on without end. It doesn't meander like The Lord of the Rings or take ten volumes and counting like S"
87,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"Joe Abercrombie needs to find the person responsible who might have misplaced the last 100-150 pages of this book just before it was to be published. But I have a feeling that he might not have to go much far to do so. A mirror would serve just as well as Hercule Poirot in this case. Yes, the book ends abruptly. But such is the curse of reading epic-fantasy. Apart from that, I enjoyed this book quite a lot. Especially the character Glokta, the Inquisitor, the torturer. His dry wit reminded me a"
88,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"8/10 A great entry into a series with lots of potential, great world building and some fantastic characters. Straight from the off with the introduction I was hooked. The writing was excellent and the action was very well described. This was all within the first 5 pages! The three main characters are well described and fleshed out, that is pretty much the purpose of the novel. It feels like a ""getting the band together"" sort of book with no real overall plot or resolution which is why I couldn't r"
89,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,3,"Another book which I was convinced I will love but did not. Up to around 30% I was in a continuous snort with laughter. Really amusing and one hell of a character – Glotka. Afterwards, the laughter kinda vanished, and I ended up dragging myself toward the finish, because nothing happened. It feels like a huge prologue, in which we get to meet a bunch of very different characters, gathered to pursue some goal in a future journey. So, no worldbuilding, not much on the characters history and really"
90,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"The Blade Itself focuses around a barbarian warrior, an inexperienced soldier, an inquisitor, and a wizard. This all sounds quite familiar, but rather than a standard epic fantasy this book is a grimdark fantasy. Being grimdark the familiar characters types are quite different than people might expect. The barbarian warrior is actually a friendly man Logen Ninefingers who's tired of fighting, but can't seem to escape it. The inexperienced soldier Jezal dan Luthar is a character so pompous and arr"
92,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"I like to read science fiction and I like to read Literature (with a capital L) and in that pursuit, I encounter all sorts of strangeness, all sorts of experimentation in form and character and language and idea. In Radiance, for example, I encountered Walden-esque chapters that were just shipping manifests. Or in Money: A Suicide Note, I encountered such mundanely unpleasant characters, such banal evil, that I concluded the narrative’s sole purpose was to provide a vehicle for the peddling of h"
93,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"The Blade Itself is pure entertainment from cover to cover. Don't let all the grimdark talk fool you: this book has as many laughs as it does gut wounds. Big thanks to Orbit/Hachette Audio for my audiobook copy of The Blade Itself in exchange for an honest review. The Blade Itself is Joe Abercrombie's debut novel, first published back in 2006. It's the first book of The First Law trilogy. The Blade Itself follows the trials and trevails of three viewpoint characters: “Blood gets you nothing but more"
94,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"Wow! This book rocks! The audio book is well performed. The characters, the worldbuilding, plot and descriptions are wonderfully well-crafted. This book is my first encounter with Mr. Abercrombie's work. The Blade Itself is a delightful introduction! There is so much to the story I have hard time even trying to comment on it. I love the characters whether it is the brooding Glokta or the aging Logen Ninefingers or the savage young woman Ferro just to name a few of the extensive cast of characters"
95,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"3.5 Stars. Middling rating with the potential to change after reading books 2 and 3. Read this review and check out the podcast at Book Geeks Uncompromised ! Murderous conspiracies rise to the surface, old scores are ready to be settled, and the line between hero and villain is sharp enough to draw blood. The quality of the characters in this book is easily its strongest aspect. All of the point of view characters, with the possible exception of one, are remarkably well written and well rounded. Jezal"
96,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"Buddy Read with Robin , Alexa , Jessica , Kat , Jennifer , Athena , and Eon This book was all kinds of epic. It was the bare bones of what high fantasy should be. More so than anything I’ve read in a long time, this book was truly the embodiment of a good fantasy novel. It had all the elements - the magic, the “heroes”, the anti-heroes, the strong female characters, and the mythical (straight up scary as hell) creatures. Never before have I found myself rooting for a torturer. And root for him I did,"
97,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,2,"The Blade Itself is the first in a trilogy, and it takes its time building up a vivid sense of the setting. It gives us plenty of time to get to know the characters in their current flawed states rather than jumping immediately into the changes they'll go through. Normally, this would sound boring, but Abercrombie's descriptive powers are impressive. He gets you involved at a level that is rare, bringing you close to the characters physically as well as emotionally. This adds depth, giving a fee"
98,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"*** 4.5. *** Glotka is creepy wonderful! Got this out of the way, now about the book. It is a grim fantasy with characters who are realistically imperfect in a world full of violence and magic is rare. So rare in fact, that when an old mage makes a comeback, his power and identity are disbelieved and his sincerity questioned. There are rich, poor, influential, noble, farmers, soldiers, barbarians and multiple racial characters, their respective storylines intercepting in ways which will obviously"
99,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"An exciting story, with lots of solid, loveable, characters (Glokta is my husbando); very well written with a lot of laugh-out-loud moments. I accompanied the read with the audiobook narrated by Steven Pacey, who did an amazing job at enhancing the whole reading experience by some 200%. (view spoiler) [""West had often told Jezal that the Northmen found in Adua, usually skulking dishevelled by the docks or dirty drunk in gutters, were by no means typical of their people. Those that lived free in th"
100,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"Joe Abercrombie’s ‘The Blade Itself’ is his debut novel, and the first in his ‘The First Law’ series. ‘The Blade Itself’ is a bloody and bloodied tale of high hopes and stakes, dashed dreams and brains, and more knives than a battalion of butchers. A barbarian, a torturer and a nobleman walk into a bar…sounds like the start to a bad joke? Wrong. It’s the start of a bloody good story. In ‘The Blade Itself’, the veritable menagerie of characters are led into the depths of plot twists and turns, pla"
101,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"This book was pretty incredible. I absolutely adored reading about every single character, no matter what kind of dark, messed up stuff they'd done. Abercrombie somehow manages to make all of them extremely well definied from their first appearance, and continues to make them compelling and fascinating through to the last pages. Even if there were characters I didn't particularly like, I still found myself itching to find out what kind anitcs they were going to get up to next, revelling in every"
102,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I started this book. Joe Abercrombie has been described to me as a writer of ""dark"" and ""cynical"" novels, but I discovered long ago that books don't strike me as dark and cynical the same way as most people. In any case, this series came highly recommended so I gave it a shot. For the most part, I felt that the book was very well-written, even though the story was a little weak for my taste. It most definitely had that ""first book to a series"" feel for me, but to"
103,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,Personal rating: 4.25 I am obsessed. This is one of the hardest books I’ve had to rate in a while. These characters felt so real and I loved them all so much but this entire book felt like the beginning of something bigger. It solely created a huge mysterious world and these characters that are all teetering on the edge of bad and worse.. yet loveable? I think I need to dock a star because of the prologue feel the entire way through. BUT THIS HURTS ME BECAUSE I LOVED IT! I can only expect the plo
104,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"Oh man what great start, this series started a little slow for me, but man did it get better as I continued to listen. And I must make note that I did listen to the audio version, which was fantastic, Steven Pacey was magnificent at crafting a great deal of different voices that hardly ever sounded the same. The main characters could not have been a greater cast to listen to, from their struggles to their triumphs I was enthralled to the last moment. I think I just have to dive into the next one"
105,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,Really appreciated it more this time around! A bloody good time!
106,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,3,"Edit: I've knocked this down to three stars as I never got going with the series and have mostly forgotten the book less than a year on. It was still enjoyable at the time, but I've nothing that's drawing me back to the world right now so think that this is a more suitable rating. An excellent start to a series that's a little on the slow side, but has enough quality characters and excellent writing to draw you in and make sure you'll stick around for the ride. This is an extremely character-focus"
107,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"So my first reading of Abercrombies work turned up a great read and a series that I am really looking forward to getting my teeth into. A lot of people will say that this is dark and gritty. There are scenes that made a lot of readers uncomfortable. But I had no such problems reading this book. If you have read Malazan or the Black Company, you will not find this too dark. The difference for most readers, I suspect, is that the usual pain and cruelty is inflicted on our protagonists or the genera"
108,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,1,"I cannot properly express how painful a read this was for me. I should have known from the struggle I had just to make it through the first few chapters. if you asked me what happened in this novel, my answer would be something like, 'a bunch of unlikeable and/or boring characters get introduced. There is a lot of swearing and gratuitous violence.' Other than that, I have zero clue as to what the whole point was. There seemed to be no plot all, just a bunch of terrible, horrible characters runni"
109,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,1,"I had high hopes for this book, but six hours in (it's an audible book) and I'm still waiting for something interesting to happen—for my own, personalized, definition of interesting. Yeah, there's fighting and torture and desperate journeys with few resources and even something of a budding romance, but all these things are jumbled together with constant point-of-view shifts and no hint of a central narrative to tie things together. All of which I could put up with if the characters were engaging"
110,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,2,"A lot of people on my friend list are going to dislike this review. I went into The Blade Itself with high expectations. Unfortunately, it just didn't hold my interest. I put this book down so many times, I eventually had to force myself to read it. The only reason I didn't give up on with was because of the promise of many that the series got better. Those same people also told me that Glokta is one of the greatest characters ever. Personally, I found him so irritating. He's really just a grumpy"
111,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,Stunning stuff! Cleverly written with a sense of humour running throughout the book. Many characters with nothing initially to do with anything to do with each other coming up with the same quotes in their head provides much of the humour in the novel e.g' You have to be practical about these things' and 'I hate stairs!' etc always produces a laugh. The characters are all very well rounded and no one is perfect in fact there are some scenes that are quite shocking considering what has gone on be
112,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"Dark and humourus! Loads of interesting characters, very real/ raw for that medieval ish period. I was bored with a few like Jazel or whatever his name is ~ But as a whole the story seems to make epic turns. Ferro and Logen are my favourite =) Up to the next! Hopefully some more of this: “The man screamed, and screamed behind his mask, and the Bloody-Nine laughed, and twisted the blade. Logen might have pitied him, but Logen was far away and the Bloody-Nine had no more pity in him than the winter"
113,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"I feel like I might be a little on the kind side giving this four stars. There were parts that were very good and interesting. Overall, there was too much grimdark check-list going on. That said, at least Abercrombie has good prose, which is something that can't be said for much of fantasy these days. It also doesn't ramble on about unimportant content, which is a huge plus! I can tell this is working into being a great series, so definitely will continue. What does the title mean, anyway? What"
114,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,2,"I'm underwhelmed. I wasn't able to get invested in anything! I didn’t care about the fate of the world, since I knew nothing about it. See, I understand the need to avoid infodumps. And then there is this new tendency in fantasy to keep it action-packed and fast-paced. However, there is a pitfall; I know nothing about what's going on. In the beginning, it didn't appear close enough to our world for me to be able to project previous experience onto it. (Later, it turns out to be a bit too similar"
116,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"Ah, so this is how swords and sorcery fantasy should be done! Say one thing for Logen Ninefingers, say he's one of the most feared barbarians of the north. He leads a pack of Named Men so famous they're used as boogeymen to scare little children. Only problem is, he gets separated from his crew, who assume (with good reason) that he's gone back to the mud (i.e. dead as a doornail). He likewise assumes (with good reason) they've gone back to the mud. So, he goes off on his own, into the north that"
117,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"There was a moment about 10-15% of the way into the book that I realized that The Blade Itself is something special. It is a rare treat of a book - so very good. It was simply a pleasure to read. Five unadulterated stars. No qualifiers. No caveats. Five stars. First, the back drop: a storm is brewing, centered around the mighty, sprawling Union (a sort of more powerful, effective Holy Roman Empire of the high middle ages). To the north a new warlord has united the disunited tribes of the northlan"
118,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"“Has it ever occured to you, Master Ninefingers, that a sword is different from other weapons? Axes and maces and so forth are lethal enough, but they hang on the belt like dumb brutes. But a sword...a sword has a voice. Sheathed it has little to say, to be sure, but you need only put your hand on the hilt and it begins to whisper in your enemy's ear. A gentle word. A word of caution. Do you hear it? Now, compare it to the sword half drawn. It speaks louder, does it not? It hisses a dire threat."
119,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"Well, the hype seems to have been warranted for this fantasy series. The Blade Itself is typical book one fare, in that a good deal of it lays down the groundwork for a trilogy (Another trilogy. There ought to be a law that fantasy readers receive three times the lifespan because damn near every story has to be a f'ing trilogy.) I ask myself, why do I even bother? But then the answer is simple. Fantasy is that genre that is the ultimate in escapism. And when a story enfolds you to the point where"
120,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"I am subtracting a star from my review solely because the book ends on a cliffhanger -- no, it would be closer to say it ends at a beginning. The fellowship of characters that Bayaz and his apprentice bring together -- Logen, Jezal, Ferro, and Brother Longfoot -- isn't successfully accomplished until the final chapters, and they don't leave for their epic quest ""to the edge of the world"" until the book closes. So this book functions as a 500-page character study, or prequel, for the reader to fam"
121,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"I would describe this as being a character driven epic fantasy. It follows multiple characters across different settings, some of whom cross paths, almost always painfully. The focus is always on the characters, none of whom are simple, or clear cut in any way. In a similar way to George RR Martin, the typical fantasy good/bad, black/white tropes are thrown out the window and instead we are treated to characters with real depth. Following the exploits of three fairly unsavoury, yet oddly endearing"
122,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,3,"Everything frightens me, and it's well that it does. Fear is a good friend to the hunted, it's kept me alive this long. The dead are fearless, and I don't care to join them. Consider this part of my break, a hiatus--one necessitated by a hard boil on the work front. This volume didn't elicit much thought on poetry or politics. The novel isn't poorly constructed, it actually shines in terms of dialogue and inner monologue. While it fails the Bechdel test The Blade Itself is an even handed approach"
123,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,Simply loved it. Abercrombie is just amazing in his writing. He described the characters and plot so beautifully that you can just admire him for that. Lots of cursing and swearing.
124,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"I read this trilogy a few years ago, around the same time as I read Scott Lynch, and I was totally excited about the new voices in fantasy at the time. I remembered that much, and also that this was very much “grimdark” and gritty and portrayed a not-so-pleasant world. But I knew I’d have to reread it, at least for my own personal satisfaction, before I finally get round to other works in the same world. With the vague memories I have of the first time I read this trilogy, it’s apparent just fro"
125,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"Excellent book! Great plot, great characters, very well written. Once all the plotlines came together, I had a hard time putting it down. Read for the first time in 2008. Gave it five stars, then for some reason went off classic fantasy. Now that I am back dabbling with fantasy, I decided to re-read it. Imagine my surprise when I realised that I remember virtually nothing of this book, not even the roughest plot outline. It was like reading a new book. Three very different main characters with ver"
127,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"This review is for the entire First Law trilogy. While George RR Martin has been slumping with the last two books of the Song of Ice and Fire series and playing footsie with HBO, Joe Abercrombie is writing fantasy the way it should be written. Unapologetic, edgy, filled with intrigue and amazing battle scenes. I can't express just how good these books were, you'll just have to read them for yourselves. Frankly, i'm jealous that you are going to get to experience them for the first time. Joe Aber"
128,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"Loved it. Did this as an audiobook. This one started slow for me, but the narration of Steven Pacy would make phone contract boilerplate sound rich and interesting, so I kept going and I'm glad I did. Abercrombie has lots of room to do very deep character development, and he takes advantage of it. Halfway through, I could see what all the fuss was about, and the second I finished Book I, I bought Books II & III. It's rare for me to read a Book II in a series, simply because there are so many"
129,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"Simply one of my favorite trilogies of all time. Joe Abercrombie has created a very dirty, real, and believable world. The story has several main characters that we get to know and to love. What makes this series so unique is its ability to blur the lines... The Good guys and Bad guys do right and wrong and make things very grey, and make it difficult for us to differntiate the two. I highly recommend this series to all adult fantasy lovers that are looking for a deeply engrossing, raw, and thri"
131,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"Sven Hassel/Glen Cook stylish action? Checked. All kind of good, great, bad, awful heroes? Checked. Luxuriant, exotic, bloody, grimy plot? Checked. Tons of blood, gore, smashed skulls, slahed necks, spilled guts? Checked. Plenty of dark healthy humour? Checked. Awsome? Checked. One of the best fantasy ever read? Checked. More Abercrombie novels I can't wait to read? Checked."
132,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,I really enjoyed this book and am excited for some more Glokta!!! The only thing I truly regret about this novel is waiting so long to start it.
133,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"Buddy Read with Robin , Athena , Alexa , Jessica , Kat , Ashley , Eon What makes high fantasy so enjoyable to me is also what makes it difficult to review. It's so dense, and so much happens, yet, as others have pointed out, so little happens. This novel is no different in that it doesn't have a central plot (other than the overarching threat of war between each kingdom) so much as it has lesser, character-driven plots that eventually converge into the whole. In the background we have political intrigu"
134,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"4.5 stars! I'm in love with 2018 so far ! (and as I'm a really positive person I'm now waiting for the moment it will start to go down... because come on, my whole year can't be only 4 and 5 stars book... can it?) I'm glad I took my time and didn't rush the reading of this book last summer when I had zero time to focus on anything because I'd have missed on something big! This first volume of The First Law series was everything I expected from a fan-favourite and more. More, because I was secretly"
136,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"If I ever met Mr. Abercrombie, I'm going to ask him a question. What I want to know is if his character of the Northman Logen Ninefingers is based, in part at least, on Marvel's Wolverine. That said, this book is a different type of fantasy. There's magic, there's lots of violence, not too much romance (in fact, I wouldn't call it romance but teenage love), and lots of dark humor and jabs at politics. While Abercrombie uses politics in a different manner than Jacqueline Carey did in her Kushiel's"
137,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,2,"Being a big fan of Martin and Tolkein's epics, I picked up Joe Abercrombie's first book, the Blade Itself, of his First Law trilogy. The book follows a mix of characters who are brought together (or are fighting against) in order to embark on a still unknown adventure. While there is a lot of action, the book is ultimately disappointing in its writing, story, and characters. The writing, from a purely technical point of view, makes the reader embarassed (even moreso) upon reading this guilty plea"
138,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"I almost wasn't going to read this. Certain words conjur certain memories and the word 'barbarian' was used a couple of times in the synopsis. I couldn't get the image of a very '80's Schwartzenegger with long hair and a sword out of my head but I figured there had to be a reason it has such a great overall rating so I relented. Totally my bad for putting this off. Oh, and if you're interested, Amazon (at least the Canadian version) has the series on for $1/book right now. That's always a great"
139,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"DAMN, IT WAS GOOD! ❦ This book made me suffer at the beginning, 200 pages of worldbuilding, presenting the many characters, and nothing happened at all! And then I started to connect with the characters, through their past I started to understand why they acted the way they acted, or at least some of them. Only when I was halfway through the story, I started to grasp the plot, and I took me even longer to see the big picture as a hole. And I’m sure I’ve barely scratched the surface. ❦ Let me start"
142,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"I expected violence and brutality for shock value alone. I have heard there are no likable characters in this book. I thought I would not like it...but I ended up loving it. The characters have their faults. They're not romantic fantasy stereotypes. They are the ugly thoughts we all have whether we admit to them or not. Our sins. Vanity, envy, wrath...But they are the good in us as well. The brutal barbarian who wants to step away from his violent past. The vain knight who wants to become worthy"

This book was really just a setup/foundation for things to come... and I didn't even realize for nearly half the book because I was just having so much fun listening to the characters... except Jezel... Between Glokta, West, Ardee, Logen Ninefingers, his Northman crew, Bayaz and his apprentice, and Farrow and her guide, I just had a grin on my face half the time... and then the ending came along and gave a taste of the action to come... can't wait to continue with Befor"

151,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"Also posted on my blog, Rinn Reads . I have to say, after finally reading the first book in the First Law series by Joe Abercrombie, I now understand why he is ‘Lord Grimdark’. The Blade Itself felt like a whirlwind of a book, despite probably being the slower of the three as it builds things up. Of course I was expecting the book to be grisly, but it was definitely grimmer and darker than I thought it would be – and that’s no bad thing. There are several points of view within the story, and each"

No author has ever gotten me this involved in a book that doesn't yet seem to have a real plot of some kind. I'm sure the plot is there, but that doesn't seem to be all that important in book 1.

Great characterizations - and that's almost all there is in this first part of the trilogy, which might not suit everyone but I was enchanted. The fight scenes are vivid and seem very realistic, perhaps because they involve nearly as many accidental and incidental injuries as deliberate ones.

157,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,I loved it - what an ending!!! I can't wait to start Before They Are Hanged. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that in the beginning of the book I struggled a bit with the pacing. Another great BR at Buddies Books and Baubles Reread February 2017 For some reason I didn't mind the pacing at all this time around - probably because I knew what to expect. Abercrombie is The Master of Grimdark (I love dark tales!) and since I was familiar with the plot I found myself enjoying many of the finer detail

Not a ton of descriptions and worldbuilding, just amazing characters. I really loved this series."

I feel like I'm waiting for something fantastic and amazing to happen, but there's no telling when that might come to pass. Logen's chapters are definitely more interesting than Glokta's and the foppish prince's who can't fence (whose name I can't remember), especially since the battles that have been so highly praised are most likely to happen in Logen's presence.

Likewise most comic takes offer little seriousness and go for broad satire. Abercrombie manages to be consistently humorous without losing a moment of seriousness or brutality.

181,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,Revised after finishing the trilogy: Absolutely one of the finest stories I've ever read. Original review: Good but maybe a bit flawed? Seemed to be lacked an main antagonist. Or a central thrust of plot. Perhaps if viewed differently as the first third of a single book. Not a first book of a trilogy. Doesn't really seem to want to stand together well on it's own. I liked bits of it a lot. Esp. the parts with Logan Ninefingers and Bayaz or even Major West. Still no idea what Bayaz is up to or why

The book has been sold as ‘gritty heroic fantasy’, though there are subtle differences enough here to make it better than a run of the mill fantasy. One of the key themes through the book seems to be about heroism, from a number of different perspectives.

191,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"This is my first Abercrombie book, and one that has wallowed in my to-read pile for several years now. My reaction: WOW. The plot of the book isn't anything new or fancy, really. It's secondary world grimdark fantasy, with barbarians, snobbish politicians, and nebulous ancient threats working their way south.

The world structure, beliefs, and magic all felt unique while still feeling organic. And the characters! The fact that Abercrombie made me love these characters is a feat unto itself. The story revolves through the perspective of several different people, and none of them are particularly likable upon first meeting. However, he never apologizes for these characters. He never"

299,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,5,"Okay, how do I explain this without sounding bonkers. This is a comedic book telling of the growing up of the Antichrist, while the angel Aziraphale and the demon Crowley try to stop the apocalypse since they have gotten too lazy and comfortable with their live on earth. There is also the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse as a biker gang: “You’re Hell’s Angels, then? What chapter are you from?“REVELATIONS. CHAPTER SIX.” “Many people, meeting Aziraphale for the first time, formed three impressions:"

301,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,5,"Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett are kickass, A-list, all-star authors in their own right. Both have an enormous command over their craft: they write with purpose. Gaiman creates so many fantastic worlds filled with a diverse range of characters, from the all-too-human to the incredibly bizarre. Pratchett, most famous for Discworld, is great at playing with (and playing off of) the most beloved tropes of fantasy. Both of them have a grasp of that circuitous, somewhat too-clever style of British w"

When I've heard people talk about Good Omens, the only characters they ever seemed to mention was Aziraphale and Crowley, to the extent that I thought that this would be some buddy-cop fantasy adventure focussing solely on them. I was disappointed to see that wasn't the case, because I enjoyed their dynamic a lot, and do wish that there was more about them. But I was very happily surprised to see"

There were a few parts where the story lagged a little and that's why I didn't give it a full 5 stars, but other than that it was very entertaining. This novel celebrates the importance of ""Free Will"" for all humankind. The authors have created a story that satirizes the plot of the ""Omen"" movie. In the film, the forces of evil send down the anti-Christ Damien to live among humans and bring forth eventual armageddon. In this novel, the anti-Christ is sent to ea"

Each character was drawn in intricate detail, and the banter between the devil and the angel was priceless. There were so many interesting historical/biblical connections with modern issues, which made the story even richer. Computers, politics, business...they were all parodied in an immensely entertaining way. Neil Gaiman is already one of my favorite authors, so I knew from the start that I'd enjoy th"

The story lines became jumbled, with new small characters being introduced and completely bored me out. Could not care less for Anathema and Newt, Madame Tracy et al. Loved the four bikers of Apocalypse (at first) and the kids, but that's it. The ending was also anticlimactic. Too bad, really, since the first opening chapters were fantastic. Hilarious, witty, amusing, I could go on. I guess humor and wit do not guarantee an enjoyable read."

Halfway through the book I could sum up what had occurred in 200 pages with a few sentences. The book really wanted to be a satire, but just wound up being a sort of soggy attempt at poking fun at something totally ripe for poking fun at, by only including a smattering of actual Revelations content. That said, the storytelling was maddeningly weak. One of the main characters read a book for 100 pages, and then vanished into thin air (literally), and"

My review is simply this, if you want to have a book that takes pokes at religion, free will, divine destiny, and just the general concept of good and evil look no further. Reading about the beginning (which sounded like a mess of misunderstandings) and going straight til the Anti-Christ being born (and misplaced) and a demon and angel doing what they can to stave off the Apocalypse was hilarious.

And including ""british"" in that description was very necessary, because I've never encountered anyone of any other nationality who was able to write like a brit.

As usual Gaiman gives us a modern take on Western mythology, in this case Biblical mythology especially Revelations. I was reminded of the Screwtape Letters by C.S. Lewis . The humor is very Pratchett. My edition had a Forward and 2 afterwards about writing the novel and how each author worked with the other. It is most impressive and highly recommended. 9 of 10 stars."

323,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,4,"4.5/5 Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett are the dream team. They know how to write a damn good book, that's for sure. It's pretty hard to find a novel so humorous without it being a celebrity memoir, let's be honest. Only other funny fictional novel that comes to mind is A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Never has the apocalypse ever been so hilarious. I loved every character in their own way and the dumb jokes in between. Brilliant book."

So I did, and it kept me sane during a long road trip through snow and ice at 80 m.p.h. Hilariously funny and at the same time touching, it's a book I want my kids to read, and soon."

It’s wryly witty in exactly the way you would expect from Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman, with a sprinkling of Pratchett-brand social satire and Gaiman-variety dark weirdness. There’s also a strong undertone of affection for humanity as a whole that I loved.

It was 50/50 that it would be a work of immense genius or a work of over-the-top brilliance gone awry. To me, it's the latter. It's too clever by half. Well, no, by whole, really. Wholly too clever.

I still really enjoyed the story though!
356,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,5,"I honestly don’t know what to say about this book. It is funny, witty, well-written, and just plain entertaining. The story itself takes place over 5 hectic days (with a brief look at 11 years before) in which the apocalypse occurs. It follows many characters, from the Antichrist to the characters War, Famine, Pollution and Death, and how they play a role in the End of the World. I highly recommend it to everyone. It really is a lighter, funnier read than the premise suggests."

My only complaint is that the authors try a little too hard to be witty at times - which, on the flip side, is just me attempting to pick something to nag at in order to prevent myself from praising this book to high heavens. It's just... enjoyable . The most perfect beach read that exists, in my opinion, if one is fond of finding out how the world ends while sunbathing."

The wittiness of Good Omens is on a par with Douglas Adams' wit so if you liked The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, I think you'll enjoy this. I don't normally write in books but I was seriously tempted to highlight lines in this book. All of it probably would have been highlighted though - it's that good!

[First attempt at review, some time after reading the book the first time] Hilarious and clever! The characters are such a delightful mix of personalities.

At first glance, there doesn't seem to be much in common with this pair. Terry Pratchett writes the world-renowned Discworld series, a fantasy epic set on a flat world, which is supported by four elephants, who in turn are standing on a great turtle which swims through the emptiness of space.

This book has been a favorite of mine for years. To say it with Clive Barker's words on the cover: ""The Apocalypse has never been funnier."" This is the story of a hodge-podge of very different characters running around, trying to either stop the end of the world as we know it, or to make it happen. You see, it's all part of the Big Plan (but is it also The Ineffable Plan ?) and technically it sho"

This is my first time reading Pratchett (terrible, I know) but I have read two Gaiman novels this year - Stardust and The Ocean at the End of the Lane - that I gave similiar ratings to.

It's not laughing at people who believe in Christianity, despite the potential there, and it's not scrapping the whole religion either. Nor is it completely condemning the other side, the demons.

You have angels, demons, witches, prophecies, 11-year-old antichrist named Adam, the apocalypse. How can this NOT be hilarious? I'm so easily amused sometimes I think I border on stupidity, but this book was unfunny, silly and random, with characters who pop up for 2.3 seconds only to vanish, never to be heard of again.

450,The Name of the Wind,Patrick Rothfuss,5,"My third re-read This is not the greatest song in the world, no This is just a tribute. Tenacious D Rothfuss isn't most original storyteller, Kingkiller chronicles draws inspiration from many places, but mostly from coming of age tales of old heroic fantasy and sic-fi (Gemel's Drenai series and Herberts's Dune as strongest spices) which added modern spices creates one very atmospheric experience. There is feeling of warm pathos oozing from every page with worldbuilding inspired by mix of Tolkein's"
451,The Name of the Wind,Patrick Rothfuss,5,This is the first book by Patrick Rothfuss. He has done very well. I have heard lots of people have mentioned that Kingkiller Chronicle is a very good book series. I find it curious. I have decided to read this book. I prefer the young version of Kvothe than the older version. He is a stupendous character. I feel Patrick Rothfuss has copied George R.R. Martin. I don't know why I am not sure whether many readers feel same as me. Rothfuss is a very good author. I love this book a lot. Alhamdulillah!

He is a kind, intelligent and witty guy but he's not perfect, he can be very reckless!. Kvothe's life is not always easy but it is always exciting. I won't spoil too much but I absolutely loved Patrick Rothfuss's unique take on dragons, the book is worth reading for that alone.

461,The Name of the Wind,Patrick Rothfuss,3,The Name of The Wind was a thoroughly enjoyable read. I found this book to be a lot like a darker version of Trudi Canavan’s - The Magician’s Trilogy. Everyone seems to be likening it to A Song of Ice and Fire - I didn’t really feel that reading through the book - that is not to say that the books that will follow will not get that grim. I am excited to see where the journey takes us next. It is essentially about an Inn Keeper (Kvothe) telling the story about his past. He just happens to be amazi

That rush to gobble up every detail like I have with Wheel of Time or the two Stormlight books, Tolken and others. There wasn't that tense sense of urgency, ever.

466,The Name of the Wind,Patrick Rothfuss,5,Let me begin this in an unusual manner by noting how some of my opinions on fantasy books and stories in general have changed as of recent. Or rather they have not changed but have been defined and realized. You see I used to not be concerned with a book that seemed like a duplicate of Tolkien. If I liked the story and it was well written then I would enjoy it. Then I came to realize that a lot of fantasy was very similar to Tolkien. So I began to say: well maybe it can't be good. It mustn't be

This novel is perfect for those that love fantasy, magical writing, and great story-telling. It's a slow burn — at times, it was a tad bit too slow for me — but the attention to detail is incredible! The foundation in order for the story to continue is set since a part of the story is told in a day. I believe the next two books will discuss the rest of his life, again being told in a day.

I had a hard time putting my finger on what bothered me, but I think it was the fact that I was tired of reading another fantasy involving a Mysterious Hero with a Mysterious Past being followed by Mysterious Mysteries.

Before I get into what I didn't like, I will take a moment to acknowledge what I thought Rothfuss did well. GOOD STUFF 1. The structure of the book was neat: a renowned hero recounting his life and demystifying the stories surrounding him.

Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series. That series is notoriously incomplete at this date, and it left me with a voracious appetite for more. So, based on the recommendation of the staff at the Tattered Cover in Denver, I picked up another fantasy novel: The Name of the Wind.

This is a true epic fantasy, the world building and amount of details makes the setting so real. And the characters are very likable (or unlikable for the antagonists). At times, tho, there were too many details - for me it slowed the action down sometimes and I'd find my thoughts elsewhere.

At the start of the book when the main character was the inn keeper, I honestly thought it was shaping up to be a 5 star read. However once his life story starts to be chronicled, it all goes down hill. I know this is a trilogy.

To name a few of the eye watering irritants: * I am so sick of complaining of this in fantasy novels! Why is it so hard to include female characters that are not used exclusivity for the convenience of either the plot or the main characters development? A book can have a cast of 50 or more side characters but the women will comprise only 4 of them and will be: -a convenient plot contrivance (1),"

There were parts that I found utterly transcendent…like the part where Kvothe picks up and plays the lute of another musician he is travelling with on the way to the University. There were a few scenes in the book like this one which were, for me, so able to communicate the moment perfectly; to put the reader into the very skin of the story's character.

Because he is so awesome, Draco and Snape are jealous. Oh and there are some girls who totally want his bone.

I was nervous about reading it but a friend convinced me to give it a go. Except by convinced I mean she guilted me into it because she was reading Mistborn based on my recommendation and she thought it only fair that I read this to appease her.

I think I would give up one of my children for the chance to write something like this: a big sprawling chronicle of someone's life. It's all there: the mundane details of eating and getting dressed and worrying about having enough money, along with grander things like magic, and dragonslaying, and falling in love with a mercurial beauty. Kvothe's story is like nothing else, and I just drank it all in. It's so REAL, the real story of"

525,The Name of the Wind,Patrick Rothfuss,5,"Building a good high fantasy story is a lot like building a fire. You need to lay down the ground work, loosely piling the tinder in the center, adding the kindling on top of that, larger pieces of wood then light the match and get it started. Add some more tinder as the fire grows until the larger pieces of wood burn on their own and then you just have to keep it going.

Unfortunately, the main character of the book, Kvothe, has several problems that kept me from enjoying the story. Kvothe has the abilities and powers of a wish fulfillment Mary Sue from some fantasy fan fiction. His life reads as if the author tried to cram in every cool idea he ever had. This book has some creative ideas, and the magic system is very compelling and original (if yo"

I was finally in the mood again to read some really intense, complicated fantasy novels so I decided to pick this one up and I LOVED IT. A lot of adult fantasies are plot and world driven which I love but it is also why I tend to stray towards YA fantasy, which is a lot more character driven.

The Name of the Wind is the only fantasy novel to impress me straight out the gate. Tolkien tells great stories with simple language. Sanderson?

542,The Name of the Wind,Patrick Rothfuss,5,"I think that Patrick Rothfuss is one of the best actual storytellers. He immerses you in the life of Kvothe with impressive skill. In general, I like to read the book, although I must say that sometimes I missed more rhythm on some parts, sometimes I had the feeling that the descriptions had a bigger role compared with the actions, slowing down the narrative motor of the novel. I think that the characters are well drawn, but for my taste sometimes the main character suffers from too much perfect"
544,The Name of the Wind,Patrick Rothfuss,5,"My Rating: 5/5 The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss is the first novel in The King Killer Chronicles following the life story of Kvothe. The story is told in three days ( The first day is this book) by kvothe to the chronicler. The present day parts are told in third person perspective by Kvothe, bast or the Chronicler while the life of kvothe is narrated by kvothe himself. This book is fantastic.

(I know that may sound strange coming from me, given that I've spent so much time bemoaning lazily used fantasy tropes the last couple of months. The keyword there, though, is lazily.) So while this is not revolutionary in terms of epic fantasy, it is damned well-told and thoroughly engrossing. Note: The rest of this revi"

It did not overwhelm or underwhelm me, but as Robin from Young Justice would say, it just kinda whelmed me. Patrick Rothfuss sets up a frame narrative in which Koth, an old innkeeper, destroys some demons in his town. The Chronicler, a guy who goes around recording stories, stumbles upon Koth and learns of Koth's true identity: Kvothe (pronounced like ""Quothe""), notorious wizard and legendary king killer. Kvo"

I don't, however, think this is a perfect book. It has its flaws and it didn't blow me away quite as much as some other books, but regardless I was captivated by Kvothe's storytelling. If you're curious. I think my main issues come from weird pacing and Kvothe's overall unlikeable character."

Not only because of the time it will take to get through, and the many other books I won't be reading because I will be reading the tome instead, but in this particular case it is the first book in a trilogy, all of the books equally as thick, and tackling a book like that takes some commitment.

This certainly does'nt fall into them. It is a story about a hero, who recalls his life events, his miseries, his love affections and his credits. It's like a long, detailed biography. The world building is certainly strong, and it does make the world smooth and detailed and likable. It also has a touch of realness in it. The magic system is sooo"
596,The Name of the Wind,Patrick Rothfuss,4,"Not a bad book, but I wasn't fully engaged until very late in it. Kvothe as a character is well-written and the author makes it easy to believe in this man who can so unbelievably brilliant at some times but so utterly foolish at others. Still, the fact that he was all over the place made it very hard for me to relate to or like him, and that impeded my enjoyment of the story somewhat, especially since much of the book is about his early life when what I really wanted to get into was the main co"

605,The Odyssey,Homer,4,"So my first “non-school related"" experience with Homer’s classic tale, and my most powerful impression, beyond the overall splendor of the story, was... HOLY SHIT SNACKS these Greeks were a violent bunch. Case in point: ...they hauled him out through the doorway into the court, lopped his nose and ears with a ruthless knife, tore his genitals out for the dogs to eat raw and in manic fury hacked off hands and feet. then once they’d washed their own hands and feet they went inside again to join ody"

During embroidery class one of us, young girls on the verge of entering the teens, would read a passage while the rest were all busy with our eyes and fingers, our needles and threads. All learning to be future Penelopes: crafty with their crafts, cultivated, patient and loyal. And all wives. The second read was already as an adult. That time I let myself be led by the adventures"

I was tasked with reading this epic work as part of an Advanced Placement English course in between my junior and senior years of high school.

We sampled literature from all over the world, and this Greek tome was one of the"
619,The Odyssey,Homer,5,Quite possibly one of my favourite books! It was this novel that ignited my love for Greek and Roman mythology and antiquity - leading me to choose a degree in Classical Civilisations.

I was a sophomore in college—a student with (unfortunate) literary ambitions who had just decided to major in anthropology.

I had little foreknowledge of the story and I haven't looked into the meanings or history too deeply. Instead I've tried to appreciate the story on it's own merits, getting swept away like Odysseus on the sea. There were quiet contemplative events and dramatic battles, personal struggles and wider societal issues. Gods and"

Sure, one can't deny how unreliable and prejudiced he is as a narrator - just look at how he twists the reality when describing the Cyclops' life and culture - but that's precisely - in addition to the engaging structure - what makes The Odyssey so readable and less 'old-felt' than The Iliad . Well assuming you're reading a translation in verses, o"

It is a masterpiece that brings out the strengths of this iconic story of the voyage of Ulysses from the fall of Troy back to his native Ithaca and his beloved and besieged Penelope. The story is highly readable and full of adventure and misadventure, monsters and heroes and ultimately a triumphant voyage home. Yes, it is very masculine in perspective so"

Sure, it's thousands of years old, and certainly Greek culture has some peculiarities, but the book is remarkably, sometimes surprisingly modern, and most translations show the straightforward simplicity of the story. Perhaps like The Seventh Seal, The Odyssey has gotten a reputation for being difficult because it has been embraced by intellectuals and worse, wanna-be intellectuals. But like Bergman's classic film, The Odyssey is focused o"

630,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"Last year I read Homer's The Iliad and loved the storyline but I was left with a sense that there was something missing from my reading experience. At times the Iliad bored me with its clunky writing style and, at the time, I concluded that this was down to the translation that read. So this year I decided to read two versions of Homer's classic epic poem The Odyssey simultaneously to decide if I would have a different reaction to the different translations of the same texts. And I 100% did! I ch"

639,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"The Odyssey is, well, the Odyssey. Beyond being a tremendously exciting read, it is a foundational work in Western literature. It is a glorious story of love and war, gods and humans, adventure in and around the Mediterranean (and, some argue, out to the West Indies). On the surface simply the story of Odysseus's adventures after the fall of Troy, it is a rich tapestry of places, characters, and creatures which have entered into the basic language of Western literature.

It's an astonishing work, brutal and violent, while at the same time deeply affecting, brimming with incisive insights into human nature. Odysseus and crew, having taken precautions to not be lured by the Sirens' song, sail past them. Homer's subsequent epic poem I was less enraptured by because of its lack of focus, even though it is unquestionable that it re"

647,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"Reading, understanding and analyzing The Odyssey is a milestone in any person's life. It is colossal, not only in length, but also in reputation. There are few books as referenced or lauded as Homer's two epics, and yet each one delivers. What makes reading The Iliad and The Odyssey in succession so satisfying is that they are unique in their tone, characters, story, and history. I think what The Iliad lacks in action and adventure, it makes up for with complex characterization. The Odyssey is f"

Now, thanks to Robert Fagles's brilliant and vivid translation, no reader should ever feel overwhelmed or literarily (word?) excluded by the Odyssey. While reading it, I learned that a) Greek men weep constantly, b) Greek hospitality is awesome and one receives many presents, c) Odysseus and Penelope's son Telemachus is pretty constantly an ass to his mother. As the story winds down and Odysseus returns to Penel"
652,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"An excellent translation in terms of poetic verve and narrative dynamism. I don't have Greek, so can't say anything about faithfulness to the original, but it's a toss-up between this and the Fagles, which I read alongside it and with which I found a lot of consanguinity, or conviviality, or something. I think I'd give a slight edge to Wilson's, but really you'd enjoy either translation. FAR superior to the Penguin one I read in my class on Joyce's Ulysses back in uni (it was by Rieu (sp?) I bel"

I began by reading “Song of Achilles” by Madeline Miller, a novel which I can’t recommend more highly, and from there to “The Iliad” in a translation by Robert Graves. Then I moved onto “The Odyssey” and this time read from the Lattimore translation after having previously studied at length the Fitzgerald translation. Homer proves that the test of time is a valid one: that is, there is a reason that the writing has endur"
658,The Odyssey,Homer,4,"I can see that this is a classic epic worthy of its reputation, but still I am disappointed in the character of Odysseus. Many say Odysseus is the first modern man, but I cannot get it. I admit that he is pragmatic, cunning, deceptive, complicated; he endures humiliation and fights for survival, for homecoming; he rejects immortality for mortality. But are these characteristics sufficient to count him as ""modern""? I only see him as different, and not in a good way. For example, Odysseus is just"
659,The Odyssey,Homer,4,"The four stars are for the translation, obviously. She is a little too brisk for me, and some of her modernising jars a little. I also do not agree with some of her interpretations (though I do like her emphasis on the “slave” rather than, for example, “maid” or similar). Really what always surprises me every time I read this text is how little of it is actually taken up with the big hits - the sirens etc - and how clearly it is really much more concerned with homecoming (and the whole thing bei"

It would be unfair and idiotic to try and compare The Odyssey with its predecessor: what one lacks the other more than makes up for.

Therefore, since the middle of last May I’ve decided to read this handsome hardcover cha"
662,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"The Odyssey needs no review. It is an important piece of literature not only for its own right, but because it has provided so much reference material for subsequent great works. I had not read it since my college days (too many years to count), so it was both interesting and worthwhile to visit it again. As the godlike and resourceful Odysseus might say, the journey was worth it."
663,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"The Odyssey is a book that in many ways must be read in conjuncture with Homer's The Iliad . Like that other work of poetry, it is an epic tale of fantasy with great truths for humanity as it stands today. The Iliad is generally considered to be the earlier of the two works (if you accept that Homer was a single individual) due to the fact that this, The Odyssey , contains a story which begins after the events of The Iliad . However, where The Iliad is a story of conflict and tragedy, full of patho"

Her translation invites a new reading of The Odyssey. Wilson makes some interesting c"
671,The Odyssey,Homer,3,"Felt natural to follow-up The Iliad with The Odyssey. I did not enjoy it nearly as much. Homer's pattern of repetition is more prevalent in this work. What I found astounding is that although I had never read this work I knew the plot. It seems portions of Odesseus' travails are told in high school and college courses, in song ( Cream), in children's books. This story emphasized the cunning discussed in The Iliad. O lived from his wits and the gifts from the gods. I was never so happy as when he"
672,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"Although the Odyssey can't be understood without the Iliad, in my humble opinion I think these are two entirely different books. The Iliad is a denser, almost historic reading, more focused on events than in characters, whereas the Odyssey is built from a more modern structure, in which there's a main character (Ulysses) with a strong goal: TO GET HOME. The Odyssey is an ideal choice for all adventure and mythology fans and a must read for all those aspiring to become a writer because it's proba"

But I'm still just so confused over what I read in The Odyssey that I don't really know how to explain what it's about. My edition did have a paragraph at the top of each chapter which tried to summarise what was going on with the various characters.

Which lets be honest here, most of my reviews are anyway. I think classics are difficult to review at the best of times but this one being so ancient, makes it all the more harder. I read this in the same fashion that I read the Iliad. That is I both listened to the audiobook and read the physical book in places. Dan Stevens narration was fantastic and I'd recommend it t"

The mythology is brilliant and I definitely want to re-read this one! The language is quite a struggle, though, so don't go into it half-hearted or"
686,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"Let’s talk about ‘The Odyssey’ for a moment. It’s one of the West’s oldest texts, an ancient work of immense importance. I’ve read it twice. Once, as translated by Robert Fagles; and now a second time, as translated by Emily Wilson. I think that both are great. From what I’ve gleaned during my short time on this planet, each new translation of a classic work is supposed to replace the old. The blurbs on the jacket of my copy of Wilson’s translation tout it as the definitive work, the one to be s"
687,The Odyssey,Homer,4,"1) Odysseus is a jerk to women everyone. 2) Chapters are called books. Just like The Iliad, there are 24 books in the Odyssey. An approximate division of story lines is: 4 books about Telemachos growing balls 4 books about Odysseus getting away from Kalypso 4 books that recount his adventures and how he lost his crew 12 books about his homecoming and killing the suitors Man! The coolest parts (the adventures) are only 4 books long. What I get from this (and the lectures about the book) is that this is"
688,The Odyssey,Homer,3,"3.5/5 The Original Epic Poem of Western Peen, PART 2: Dear Odysseus, you shady weasel of a man... A grade-A prick, that's what you are. Now, to be fair, you and your mind games are compelling to read about. Slimy as you are, you are still - and, believe me, it hurts to say this - the quintessential Greek hero. That said, still want to hurt you. A lot. Dear Calypso, I liked you better when you were terrifying dudes, but then you went and got yourself a shit taste in men. Keep pointing out those dou"
689,The Odyssey,Homer,4,"I know, as crazy as it sounds I didn't hate The Odyssey, in fact, at parts, I actually sorta/kinda liked it. I know, crazy. But whatever. Most people know what The Odyssey is about, and if they don't, they will. So, I am not going to waste time explaining it. For those who have read it, here are my opinions: Hate Penelope. Period. She is so whiny, and I am probably about to be shunned by the millions of Twilight fans, but she reminds me A LOT of Bella (cringe as fruit flies toward an unsuspecting"
690,The Odyssey,Homer,4,"“Sing to me of the man, Muse, the man of twists and turns … driven time and again off course, once he had plundered the hallowed heights of Troy.” I wouldn't have picked this up had it not been for my incipient interest in Mythology, and thus found myself enrolled in a MOOC which dealt with mythologies of the Greek and the Roman. To read this epic seemed like a daunting endeavor, but I was greatly surprised to find it so accessible, and save for a few bits here and there, I was fully engrossed and"
691,The Odyssey,Homer,3,"Had to read this one in school. Though I prefere the Iliad story, the adventures of Odysseus were interesting and his journey was full of action and hidden meanings behind his andentures."
692,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"Dithered about the rating here but ended going for the 5 star. This heroic epic has stood the test of time and it's a rollicking good read as well. The Odyssey has a bit of everything and universal appeal, there's adventure, greed and the enduring love between Odysseus and his wife Penelope..... Was a tad hesitant at first but found this an excellent and palatable translation of the epic."
694,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"Ah, The Odyssey. Only a fool could rate this less than five stars on account of its literary qualities, but this book is such an instrument of white, male power that I must leaven my praise with a little criticism. George Orwell said you shouldn't judge Rudyard Kipling's literary output by the politics disseminated within it, and that point is well taken. But, for someone of the Left, there is a particular scene that is most despicable and always gives me shudders (besides the many scenes where"
696,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"The Odyssey is a story about a homicidal maniac (Odysseus) who refuses to ask for directions. This tragic flaw, shared by many men, leads his crew to disaster. Some are eaten by monsters, some are eaten by their crew-mates, and some finally get fed up with this cruise from hell (literally at one point), and take a flight home. Finally, Odysseus returns home, and is shocked, SHOCKED, to discover that after a 20-year absence, his wife is entertaining the possibility of remarrying."
697,The Odyssey,Homer,5,Emily Wilson's translation is so readable and refreshing! This edition has by far the best introduction to the Odyssey I've ever read. More thoughts may come soon!
698,The Odyssey,Homer,4,"The Odyssey is one of two narrative poems that have been attributed to the Greek poet Homer; while it is not entirely clear that he actually composed both or any of them. While it can be said that The Odyssey is a sequel to Homer’s Iliad, reading them out of order will not put you at a major disadvantage. Iliad tells the story of the war on Troy and remains popular due to the fact that it is one of the only surviving Greek classics that actually deals with thetopic. The destruction of the Librar"
700,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"I read this when I was a teenager at school and decided to give it another go. I enjoyed reading his remarkable journey full of adventure, wit, bravery and mythical creatures."
701,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"Let's play a drinking game, shall we? Every time you read something misogynistic, take a shot. You'll love the Greeks by the time you've read the book! But now, in all seriousness, I think the most important thing to know before reading this book of poems is that it was never intended to be written, rather it was meant to be heard. Homer basically read this out loud at banquets and only a story at a time. So don't feel pressured to read this all in one sitting and take you time. Or you can just g"

Just like your father—at least I’ve heard his praises, Nisus of Dulichion, a righteous man, and rich. You’re his son, they say, you seem well-spoken, too. So I will tell you something. Listen. Listen closely. Of all that breathes and crawls across the earth, our mother earth breeds nothing feebler than a man.

703,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"I drag my feet on reading the classics because I think I'm going to be bored, but to my surprise I found I enjoyed The Odyssey tremendously. It did not read like an epic poem in any classical rhythmic metered way that would eventually put me to sleep, it read like a favorite story that had finally been written down after being told for generations. It was easy to absorb, but it would have to be because people remembered it, liked hearing it and liked repeating it, and that's why it has survived"
704,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"After reading the Iliad for the first time, it only made sense to read this book. I've read this book a few times before, but it was fun picking things up I didn't before. This is also the first time I picked up this book after reading Jame Joyce's Ulysses a few years ago. I liked comparing the two books. I know there are several different takes on this book, but Joyce still stands out for me compared to the others. Plus, I loved the ending to Joyce's book over Homer. Homer doesn't give you the"
705,The Odyssey,Homer,1,"Accoording to what i know about Odysseus i believe that he should not be in the Hero Hall of Fame Nomination Committee. He killed innocent people , cheated on his wife, and ate his friends. I believe that says it all about who Odysseus really is."

707,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"""His lies were like the truth."" The five stars are for the lovely rhythmic English in Emily Wilson's fluent translation. I read it twice, once for the content, and again for the poetry. It's all about style, hers is simple on the surface, a clear window that reveals the multiple layers of meaning in the text...starting with line one: ""Tell me about a complicated man."" ""Complicated"" is a simple word in itself, but warns the reader that Odysseus will not be one dimensional like Paul Bunyan. Odysse"
708,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"“When gods spin threads of pain, even great kings are made to wander far and suffer greatly.” The first time I read The Odyssey, I read the Fitzgerald translation in a college English class, with a wonderful teacher who helped us along with backstory and her excitement for the text. I loved it. This time I was similarly helped by fellow readers, teachers and scholars in the group read of Emily Wilson’s new translation: https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/... . I learned so much from them, and from"
709,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"In both high school and college, my exposure to The Odyssey was limited to a couple of chapters or sequences hand-picked by the instructor as a kind of overview of the epic. What I learned about The Odyssey was that it was about gods and monsters and it involved a lot of convoluted, completely irrelevant details. Mainly it just seemed like some primitive narrative instructors were plowing through before moving on to the good stuff. I only picked it up now because I read an article about Emily Wil"
710,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"A wonderful and enchanting masterpiece by Homer that fascinates you from the opening pages! Reading it immediately after the ‘Iliad” was very important in order to understand the main story, key heroes and the background context of the work, as it is basically about the homeward journey (nostos) of Odysseus, after the sacking of Ilium. Reading this great work in adulthood allows you to understand its deep layers of meaning and thus enjoy its beauty even more. The epic addresses different themes"
711,The Odyssey,Homer,4,"A riveting adventure summed up as a series of unfortunate events multiplied tenfold and blew it into epic proportions! I have to admit that this is the first time I've read Homer's Odyssey; and I liked it. My heart goes to poor Odysseus, who after surviving the ten-year Trojan war, has to circumnavigate the odds and begin a ten-year voyage back home to his grieving family in Ithaca. His voyage home was never easy. Teemed with trials and tribulations, he traveled to the underworld, encountered hid"
712,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"After reading The Iliad a couple years back, my hopes for enjoying Homer were not high. The battles and genealogies of The Iliad were interesting, but it felt more like reading history than fiction. It turned out my fears that The Odyssey would be the same were unfounded. The Odyssey , and its hero Odysseus, quickly slashed their way through the fray and became one of my all-time favorite books. The Odyssey is, in part, the story of the hero Odysseus, a man so driven by love for his wife, his son"
713,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"Here we are again! Having read Chapman's Odyssey , it was soon clear that Richmond Lattimore's more clear, muscular-seeming but sometimes surprisingly understated verse would not be aiming for the elegant rhyming form I had become familiar with (if with difficulty, and I suspect, because I read rather quickly, not always digesting all that was said). But I don't think this is at all laziness on Lattimore's part (part of the praise for his translation is for fidelity), because the almost prose-lik"
714,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"For all practical purposes, the Odyssey is the ""sequel"" to the earliest well-known surviving work in Western literature, the Iliad. (The Epic of Gilgamesh, while at least 1,000 years older, is neither as well-known nor as influential as Homer's work.) Unlike many sequels in the present era, however, the Odyssey actually seems to be an improvement, in some respects, on the original, and stands quite well as an independent work. Odysseia—the poem's name in Greek since Herodotus called it that in t"
716,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"Now I'm showing off... I'm not going to write a review for the Odyssey; I think that thousands of years of influence and praise speak for themselves. However, I will tell you what happened when I was reading the last books of the poem, in which Penelope is reunited with her husband. In those days, I happened to be home alone while Alec was in Olney, dog-sitting his mother's dogs. Well, during that time, Alec had to fight against terrible storms that put his commute in peril and isolated him from"
718,The Odyssey,Homer,1,"I usually don't rate books 1 star, but The Odyssey was dreadfully boring for me. Most of the book, I found that I couldn't follow the action and/or the dialogue, and it was all just extremely tedious. There were a few clever moments like when Odysseus had to outsmart the Cyclops, but the dialogue and the ""begats"" (i.e., Telamachus, son of Odysseus, who is Laertes' son) just got in the way of the narrative. The plot felt very disjointed. After reading this, I'm leary about reading other ancient e"
719,The Odyssey,Homer,3,"This edition of Homer's Odyssey is a modern contemporary translation by Robert Fagles narrated by award winning actor Ian McKellen (who really needs no introduction.) Strictly as a story alone The Odyssey doesn't exactly grip me, although it has its moments I caught my mind wandering at times. Maybe I have some of that ancient Roman bias for the Trojans as I am enjoying the Aeneid much more (credit to Virgil.) Still the rich descriptions of scene, and celebration of dialog are entertaining enoug"
720,The Odyssey,Homer,4,"Thereat the other, stirred by the god, began and showed his skill in song: starting the story where some Argives boarding the well benched ships were setting sail and spreading fire through the camp; while others still, under renowned Odysseus, lay in the assembly of the Trojans all hidden in the horse; for the Trojans themselves had dragged it to their citadel. So there it stood, while long and uncertainly the people argued, seated around it. Three plans were finding favour: either to split the"
722,The Odyssey,Homer,3,Real rating: 3.3 stars This book was yet again another class required read and this is the first time I actually liked a school read this year. Greek mythology is something that I've been interested in since a very young age (thanks to Rick Riordan tbh) and I loved reading the story of Odysseus and his men encountering different mythical creatures and gods. The journey was the part I enjoyed the most because it was the most interesting. Reading about the way that Odysseus faced the creatures and
723,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"Not only a classic, but a great adventure as well 12 August 2011 - Athens There are two books which I believe form the foundation of Western Literature as we know it. One of them is the Bible and the other is The Odyssey. The Odyssey is a story that has everything in it: adventure, action, and even erotica. Originally it was an oral poem that was passed down by ancient Greek bards who would travel the land and in return for food and shelter, would tell the inhabitants of the towns the visited the"

Thus my journey ends! Thank you Homer! The Odyssey was a pretty good read. I have to say that I enjoy reading Classics very much. The language baffles and amazes me! It makes me fly – truly! These Classics are meant to be read once a year – not to sharpen your memory about the events of th"

729,The Odyssey,Homer,2,"Greeks weeping every time something upsetting simply gets mentioned makes me laugh about how ridiculous that is. But portraying the women like weak pawns for the men's plots, even the Lady Penelope has no one defending her, and calling misogynistic and egotistic Greeks who blindly thirst for blood heroes, then have the Gods so directly preventing revenge on those heroes which they so deserve???

739,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"Homer's The Odyssey is so grounded in the foundation of world literature that it is largely beyond reproach, and likewise beyond praise. Homer's two epics, this and the Iliad , are two halves of the same foundation: the journey out, and the journey back; the external conflict, the internal conflict; the war saga, the family saga. The two comprise such a vastness, that it would seem that most, if not all, Western literature are the offspring of Homer. From the Iliad we have War & Peace , Moby D"

743,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"It's the Odyssey; you should probably read it. Fitzgerald's version is very readable, and not particularly scholarly, so it's ideal for actually reading. I doubt it's much use if you're looking for a trot to read alongside the Greek, but since I don't know Greek... well, it suits my purposes. Everyone who reads the thing seems to have an idea about the *one thing* the book is about, which is ridiculous, since even in translation you can see that it's a bunch of different stories stitched togethe"

It was interesting to finally know Odysseus's... odyssey? 🤔🤔 And it was very nice too to read such and old book, so I understand why I like more The Song of Achilles of even The Lightning Thief because what I love most about book, is how they make you relate to the characters on so many levels, is no just a story of someone...

748,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"My first Odyssey, and so my favorite. I've read this edition a few times, and it's always a new experience. The rhythm of this translation is smooth and rolling, but it can have a narcotic effect in which the sounds and melody (even in silence) lull you away from the language and the story. This isn't a bad thing, of course, especially if you're hanging out on Circe's island or eating a little lotus. Maybe this is why episodes and words resonate differently on repeated readings- I find the book"

I did not rlly like this book, i didn’t know what was going on. i just knew enough to pass my tests and such over this book.

Don't let its reputation as a brainy classic steer you away from this wild, fun, and eloquently told adventure."
759,The Odyssey,Homer,4,"I very much enjoyed the middle of this book, but found that the beginning and the end dragged quite a bit. Very little is known about Homer, he was Greek and it's thought that he lived between 800 and 700BC. There is a book by Robert Graves called Homers daughter that I must get around to borrowing from the library. That book imagines that Homer was actually a young woman. The Odyssey is set in the bronze age, about 12 BC. Just thinking of the age of this story mesmerised me. This book was writte"
761,The Odyssey,Homer,3,"As with most books high schoolers at my learning institution are required to read, I heard horror stories about The Odyssey from older siblings, whiny facebook friends, etc. Needless to say, my expectations were low. I did have a little faith in it though; it's a ""classic"" for a reason. If I could sum it up in a word: meh. The characters were uninteresting, especially Odysseus himself. I feel bad for the ancient Greeks who had to regard him as a hero, considering he is a major jerk. Being a fair"
762,The Odyssey,Homer,4,"Knowing they were foundational and mistakenly thinking them something like the oldest books in the world, I read Homer's Iliad and Odyssey on my own sometime during junior high school. I have no idea what translation I used except that it was more prose than poetry. The more poetic versions by Fitzgerald and Lattimore had to wait for college. Unlike the Iliad, the Odyssey was actually fun as it has a compex plot held together by Odysseus' overarching, oft frustrated compulsion to get back to his"
763,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"This is an incredible read - provided you are interested in a plot-driven story. I usually am not - what is happening around the next corner of a story is generally less interesting to me than what the character will do with it. How that event will change them. But that isn't a factor here. Instead, in this story, you see the height of plot-driven story-telling. And it is fascinating - both for what it reveals about ancient Greece, and for how it structures itself. Truly, so many tropes in moder"
764,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"It has been many years since I read The Odyssey, and, while I appreciated it, I don’t remember actually enjoying it. Wilson’s translation changed that.

Still, the descriptions are really surprisingly lovely even in translation! Also lots of interesting details about, like, what kind of furniture people had, which I'm always super interested in. It's interesting how their culture was really different from ours in a lot of ways, but you don't get that same feeling of ""I'm reading about aliens WTF"" that you get from, e"

768,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"For reasons I don't remember, I gave The Odyssey three stars. I am now thinking that this text is probably above being rated since whether or not one ""likes"" Homer is beside the point. I am changing my rating to five stars with full admission that giving a rating to on one of the most important founding texts of western civilization is to take oneself a little to seriously."
769,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"This is more obligatory post than anything else... What can I say about The Odyssey that hasn't been said before? It is complex, violent, and beautiful. It makes you question what it means to be a leader, and how pride can cause you a heap of trouble... This is probably my 12th or 13th time reading The Odyssey, and I still enjoy it--am in fact, still finding new things."

774,The Odyssey,Homer,4,Who am I to mess with the classics? Some will enjoy this...but others won't.
775,The Odyssey,Homer,4,One of the great mythology stories of all time. It can be hard to read in it's original form. Very recommended if you love the Greek classics and mythology.
778,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"This is a story of Winds (out-of-hand fate/destiny), Oars (doing your best), and Boulders (difficulties). It’s much better and more complex and richer in Myth than The Iliad. The Homecoming Journey of Odysseus who deserved to be the successor of Achilles' shield (as in successor in glory). Achillies is the muscles, Odysseus is the brains. Odysseus reached his homeland, killed all suitors, then it all came down to this: Going back to his wife, to reintegrate with her, to sleep again in her bed. Bu"
780,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"This translation of the book reads like a novel, not a poem: It’s the first time I’ve been able to read poetry without forgetting each word the moment I read it. This is in large part thanks to the kind of language Emily Wilson uses. In her introduction she explains that other translations often use some sort of old fanshioned English. Which makes reading the book unnecessarily complicated. The story itself is very old, filled with customs and ideas that are hard to understand for a modern weste"
782,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"Rereading The Odyssey, this time in Emily Wilson's recent and much-discussed translation, brought to mind how much this classic speaks to issues of our own day. To give a single example, a major theme of the text, and I had largely forgotten this, is the importance of hospitality towards strangers, a theme that is also all over the Hebrew Bible. When Antinous rebukes the Swineherd for bringing the beggar, actually Odysseus in disguise, to the suitors feast, his words sound familiar: ""Do we not h"
783,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"I have a soft spot for the history of how we learned things and because of that, Wilson's Introduction and Translator's notes are the highlight of this book for me. I have no real background in Classics and at most a high school level of knowledge about mythology and the Ancient World, and I found her thorough explanation of what we do and don't know about who Homer was, when The Odyssey is from, and the cultural and historical context of the poem to be enlightening, fascinating, and very access"
784,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"Emily Wilson’s translation of the classic tale of Odysseus’ voyage and return home is very readable, and her notes on the text provide some context without overwhelming the reader. I enjoyed her version, but based on the passages I compared, this version is a little too breezy to replace my much loved Robert Fitzgerald translation."
785,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"Joe Sachs' translation is clean, clear, and accurate. It lacks the poetry of many other translations, but there are plenty of those and not enough of these. The only one it compares to is Lattimore, but Sachs treads more lightly, more like Odysseus himself, and less like Achilles. Sachs wisely appends his ""introduction"" to the end of the work, a gesture of good sense and humility. Like Peter Green, Sachs spent a whole career reading and questioning and talking about the classical Greeks before s"
786,The Odyssey,Homer,4,"This story brings new meaning to the expression about fish and house guests! I much preferred this to The Iliad. The story took one on a winding path (very literally) with interesting characters (if indeed a bit hypocritical, blood thirsty and vengeful). I ended up with the Fagels's translation, and it definitely made the experience easier. Should someone wish to read The Odyssey, I would recommend that version."
787,The Odyssey,Homer,3,"There tends to be two types of people: Those who prefer The Iliad and those who prefer The Odyssey. I am for the former not the latter. Despite this, I do still find The Odyssey to be an entertaining Greek epic, one which I can't wait to reread in the newly released Emily Wilson translation."
791,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"Uhm, how do you rate Homer? 5th star is for Emily Wilson, whose introduction, translation and notes made the whole experience a joy. P.S. I know! Sexism is all over, grow up, this is almost 30 centuries old, so give it a break."

Despite several famous inconsistencies, and a completely different theme, it was remarkable to me how consistent it is with the Iliad . Characters don't change, and the plot only covers in detail parts of the Trojan War that weren't covered in the I"
799,The Odyssey,Homer,4,"I enjoyed this book a lot more than I thought I would!! This translation was not at all hard to understand, which is good for me, as I read it for school. I am also a big fan of Greek mythology, so I already understood all the concepts behind the gods and stuff. I also appreciated how it was action-packed and fantastical, two aspects that aren't in many school-assigned books. The Odyssey was quite gory at times too, and extremely descriptive. At those parts I was cringeing a bit! The book did mo"
800,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"The Emily Wilson translation is a wonderful read - highly recommend it. It's much better than the Robert Fagles' translation. Which one would you rather read? Here's some examples... Opening, Book 1, line 1. Wilson's Tell me about a complicated man. Muse, tell me how he wandered and was lost when he had wrecked the holy town of Troy, Fagles' Sing to me of the man, Muse, the man of twists and turns driven time and again off course, once head plundered the hallowed heights of Troy.

801,The Odyssey,Homer,4,"This was my first reading of The Odyssey in verse translation, having read E. V. Rieu’s prose version over twenty years ago. I opted for the Lattimore translation, as I had read this is closest to the Greek dactylic hexameter and preserves the oratorical nature of the original. Lattimore’s verse is simple, yet lyrical and effective. I enjoyed reading it, but feel I need to read more than one translation to fully appreciate the poem. I did peruse small snippets from Alexander Pope’s version and c"
802,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"Ladies and Gentlemen, this book has been sold to us all wrong. Show of hands: who among you has heard mention of either The Iliad or The Odyssey and rolled your eyes over yet another ""classic"" work of fiction forced on unsuspecting high school students meant to bore us into submission? Dudes, this is seriously one of the most exciting books I've ever read. It's practically a ... Um, who's the current go-to action hero actor? Anyways, this is the movie he would star in. It's like if you took Quen"
803,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"If Indiana Jones had fought in the Trojan War, his trip back home to Ithaca might have looked a lot like the 10-year journey that Odysseus experienced! I read the Iliad earlier this summer (and reviewed it here as well), and rediscovered why it is such a classic. And, now, likewise with The Odyssey, which I loved even more! Here is the epic story of Odysseus, a valiant hero who fought in the 10-year long Trojan war. When the war ended, he encountered obstacle after obstacle, and only after anoth"
806,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"Here we are once again, with the poet imploring the Muse to sing her song about the adventures ensuing the the fall of Troy. Having just finished rereading The Iliad which told of the rage of Achilles and the Trojan War, I find The Odyssey a much more congenial book, seemingly modern in structure and outlook, even as it tells of events before the beginning of history as we know it. It tells the journey of Odysseus on his way home from Troy, a journey that takes him ten years. Odysseus is a man w"
807,The Odyssey,Homer,3,"Ans so ends my summer with Homer, finally, after many short reading sessions spliced in between other (and easier) things to read. The trouble with that method is of course the obligatory re-reading of passages to try and pick up the forgotten thread. But I did it, with only the help of a small (and barely helpful) dictionary of mythology to guide me in my ignorance. I could have used a good-looking and enthusiastic classics scholar to point out the hidden wonders that I undoubtedly missed, but"
808,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"I read some of the reviews of this book and nearly vomited. This is one of the best books in literature. Ever. It is far superior to the Iliad for many reasons, and while it's not perfect, it has incredible value. Take away that value, and you have some scenes of this book (yes, it's a poem. Don't argue with me.) that are stunning in their brutal and bold portrayal of what a man will do when his family is in danger. It's still just as worthwhile. Fagles' translation is what you must read, because"
811,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"The Odyssey written by Homer is an age-old tale that has lasted the test of time. It is the touching story of one mans harrowing journey home. Odysseus has been kept prisoner by the nymph Calypso for seven years on top of his attempted journey home after the Trojan War, in all he has been gone twenty years. The grey-eyed goddess Athena makes an appeal to the other gods to allow Odysseus his freedom and safe passage home after all these years. The other gods agree and Odysseus starts his long jou"
812,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"What did I think? WHAT DID I THINK?? I thought this was grizzeat! This translation by Robert Fagles simply effloresces (winged words, baby) from start to finish. Fagles puts the izzle in the sizzle, so to speak. Granted, I can dig the Homer experience by any translator, but this serves as the foundational version...start with Fagles, then move on to the overladen fluidity of the others. Whatever warms your heart First, let's begin with the introduction by Bernard Knox. Whammaniskey! Racing feet an"
813,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"A literary epic of epic proportions, Homer's The Odyssey is a masterpiece that is delightful, riveting, enchanting and captivating. Stirring up the deepest emotions with playful discourses, passionate exhortations, daring adventures, and romantic escapades. I think what I enjoyed most about The Odyssey was its pertinent and applicable flair that I so often found myself citing in reference or application to a specific challenge or problem frequently felt in 21st century America. We, as Westerners,"
814,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"It is another masterpiece by Homer! This is an epic journey home of Odysseia from Troja war. This journey took 10 years and lots of adventures. While this journey, Odysseia will be faced with call of the sirens, cave of the Cyclops and obsession of some Greek gods. As a language, imaginary and the story is just a big piece of epic! If I compare with Iliad; Iliad is repeated some scene and also conversations. I don’t mean in a bad way. I mean story in Iliad brewed slowly, make the reader understa"
816,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"Everything about this new translation is a class act. It brought the times and ways of Odysseus' return to Ithaca to life. The poetic translation was fun to read, but it supported a gorgeous revisiting of the book that endowed it with a freshness that surprised and delighted me. I read it slowly, making my own notes and commentary as I went a long, letting me capture the things that seemed so familiar as to seem contemporary, or things so alien that I could not see any relationship to my own cul"
817,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"Fagels's translation of the Iliad and the Odyssey are both magnificent -- highly readable, with forceful and direct prose that (I have to imagine, since I have no expertise) are closer to the experience of the original oral texts. For me, the measure if the success of the translation is whether it allows a text this old and culturally removed from the reader to retain its emotional impart. This one does -- though, unexpectedly (for me, anyway), it's most compelling moments actually belong to Pen"
818,The Odyssey,Homer,3,"I was not sure whether I was going to enjoy The Odyssey, but I actually did. The translation was (mostly) entertaining and fun to read. It is clear why the tale of Odysseus' journey home is so popular. I would like to go back to this someday and reread it because my class that I was reading it for made us skip a few chapters in the middle and i don't feel like going back and reading the chapters I missed right now. My only complaint is that at some parts it was slow and I became bored because it"
819,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"I've decided to treat this book as a treatise on manners. I'm puzzled about one thing though. The next time I throw a party and have an uninvited guest, is it more appropriate to impale him on one of my bronze spears? or to cut off his genitals, feed them to my dog, and then cut off his nose, hands and feet? At least, I can now rest assured that slaughtering my unfaithful women servants is a task best left to my henchmen."
820,The Odyssey,Homer,3,"UPDATE: I have rated it lower; last time was 4 stars and this time is 3. I was going to go as low as two, but the chapters about Polyphemus and the destruction of the suitors at least keep me interested... _____________________________________________________________ If this wasn't a literary classic, I would probably rate it lower, but I understand its importance in canonical and historical realms and respect it as such."
821,The Odyssey,Homer,3,"The spicy tale of Odysseus' protracted and wandering return to Ithaca and his wife Penelope after the events of the Iliad. I was surprised to find the epic so accessible. Some of the violent scenes are very unpleasant and superfluous, but some passages and ideas are luminous and it is easy to see why Homer was so beloved and the work has survived. When I visited Ithaca it was nice to know the story!"
822,The Odyssey,Homer,4,"A wonderful adventure, so much better than the Iliad. One of those classic stories that you have heard of bits and pieces from here and there; probably from the odd movie, this is the book a lot of it has been taken from. Sirens and Cyclops and vengeful Gods, King's and queens and backstabbing traitors. For a book that was written so long ago this quite the action packed adventure. Well written with the odd twist here and there. I'll be re-reading this one day."
824,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"One of the most important books ever written... the very fabric of storytelling is woven with the wily hands of the ever crafty Odysseus. Meet the hero who inspired all the rest and discover that he is not so much of a hero as a man who wants to get home. Above all, he is human - painfully, gloriously, tragically, definitely so."
825,The Odyssey,Homer,4,SPOILERS - It could have been 5 stars but since Odysseus cheated on Penelope with Circe I can't do that. Why Odysseus? Why? - Another thing I didn't like was that Deus ex machina ending. - My favorite character: grey-eyed Athene <3
826,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"I really loved this new translation from Emily Wilson! It's engaging and accessible, but still incredibly beautiful and classic. This is one I would recommend to both new and repeat readers of The Odyssey."

She is so talented at character development, and it really shines in this book. Here, Harry is 15 years old, and for most of the book, he's whiny and self-centered, just like a typical teenager. I also adore Dumbledore's role in this book--his conversation at the end with Harry put me to tears.

I will start by saying that this is one of my least favorite books in the series, and that isn't because it's bad, BECAUSE IT IS DEFINITELY NOT.

It is saved only by the virtue that it is a Harry Potter book and moves the series along to the still yet unknown finale.

It was held at a Barnes and Noble and of course John Williams’s soundtrack for the first 2 movies was played on a loop throughout the night. Amidst the crowd eagerly awaiting the stroke of 12, were tired adult chaperones and sullen workers who had had enough already . My brother brought me to the stor"
880,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,5,It’s not easy being 15 years old for Harry Potter. I almost cried in this one. Its pretty emotional.... often heartbreaking- Harry is put through the wringer in this long door stopper. It could have been shorter - yet it’s so heartfelt - ending on a sad note. I felt proud of Harry in this book —he makes a difference in many characters lives. Really touching! Thank you Lisa....’you’ are definitely my Potter inspiration!!!
881,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,4,"I liked the book, but it easily could have been 500-600 pages long. THIS IS ALMOST 900 PAGES LONG! Damn, you call this children's book? This is the only movie i have not watched yet. Therefore, i have zero idea what goes down in this. Maybe that's why i was so lost in Half-Blood Prince."

Why is my memory so poor, you ask? Because while I remember it being this good when I first read it, I've only had the altered perceptions of the movie to go by ever since! And that is a MISTAKE. I should have known. Short movies like that can't do real justice to heavy, heavy tomes like this novel. :) Notably missing: the TWINS! Sure, they get their big time to shine in th"

I actually like it. The first three books were silly children’s books with the occasional really good part. Enjoyable, but hardly remarkable. The fourth was an excruciatingly boring book that was saved by its amazing ending. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix , on the other hand, is a great fantasy novel.

This book is the turning point and also the most difficult for me to read. For starters, I detest Umbrage that foul woman. In fact I abhor her to the point that on occasion I have skipped from book 4 to 6 just to avoid her. Order of the Phoenix is a whopping 870 pages. J K Rowling's prose has transformed from being geared toward kids to teenagers, mirroring Harry's own development. In books 1-4, the language is easy enou"

890,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,5,[Warning: some slight spoilers but no name drops] The fifth installment of the Harry Potter gets a bit darker with the death of a fan favorite and a sadistic new master of the Dark Arts at Hogwarts. Rowling's writing style gets a bit more rounded out and the action is fairly non-stop throughout. The Order of the Phoenix will have a large role to play in these last few books and we start to see a bit more humanity in some characters who have up to now been nearly demi-gods. I feel like there are a

Rowling,5,"“Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike.” 4.5 This book may not be perfect, but it was inching its way toward that finish line. I enjoy comedic, childlike humor as much as the rest of the fans, but to me when the story gets a little darker (deeper), it gets even better. We get a return of favorite characters, but as with the other books, we also get new ones. While the rest of the series introduced new characters that were fun and that we actually wanted to read"

I didn't want to rush through this book because it is my first time reading it so I just wanted to to be great. ANYWAYS, THIS BOOK IS AMAZING. The last 200 pages were just WOW.

I understand why it’s as bis as what it is because it’s introducing new characters, setting the scene, going into more depth with other characters, but honestly some of it wasn’t really necessary; my main example was the cleaning of the house. Now moving on, I love that it’s getting darker and the story is really really coming along, we’re getting more answers on what is going to hap"

At the end of book 4, The Goblet of Fire , the series started to take a more intense, and dark turn. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is haunting, and heart pounding. Sometimes, I was griping the book, because I was just so focused. My mother called me while reading, and I was so mad at being interrupted at such an intense scene. I liked that it was darker nove"

From the very beginning of the book, just like Harry, I was mad at Dumbledore cause he really seemed to ignoring Harry, which as a fact he was, but then at last when Dumbledore told Harry the reasons why he had been acting so distant I couldn't help feeling sorry for Dumbledore and the fact that instead of stopping Harry from sho"
899,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,5,"Well, I found this book very predictable. I could guess things even before they happened. Pattern of the book didn't change. But it was okay to read. OVERVIEW After the return of Voldemort in the last book, Dumbledore re-create a group of wizards named: Order of Phoenix to face Voldemort who is also creating his army to attack. Ministry of Magic doesn't believe Dumbledore when he says 'Voldemort has returned'. So, he has to do what must be done on his own. But the Ministry doesn't sit watching."

Like really. I'm having such a tough time picking out a favorite of the series because they're all so good! But in the end all I can really say is that Umbridge is a cold-hearted b-word (Can I say that word in a review? I probably shouldn't.) Although some of the characters (nam"

A combination of frustration over being kept in the dark and fear that he will be expelled fuels much of Harry's anger, and it all comes out at once, directly aimed at Ron and Hermione. Rowling perfectly portrays Harry's frustration at being too old to shirk responsibility, but too young to be accepted as part of the fight that he knows is coming. * Harry's detention with Professor Umbridge.

So I must say that this book is my second favourite one in the series after The Chamber of Secrets. And what do you think happens after you read a GOOD book? Any guesses? Yeah, in the words of Rowling, something MAGICAL definitely occurs...

Yes it's a tad bit whiny.

Still I remember reading it in a day when it first got out. Because, Sirius. Don’t think I’ll need to explain more about that. Because, the DA meetings are awesome and Luna is lovely. Because, it is truly admirable that J.K. Rowling created the most despicable fictional character ever! Obviously, I rate this with 5 out of 5 stars."

He lashes out at Ron and Hermione often and I always struggle a bit with this book. Harry is angry and tends to not be that nice of a kid. I can't blame him though. I th"

Aaannyyywwayyyy, this book shot my expectations through the roof. It's like J.K. Rowling keeps getting better, but to do this she needs to smash my heart to pieces that get smaller with every book.

In fact, it was worse because you know you can't do anything, and you're actually expecting the bad things to happen. But the thing is, the first time I read these books, I only liked them; I wasn't attached to neither the story nor the characters - I simply enjoyed them.

I didn't want him to die :(... Overall, I really liked this book, but I think it was way too long, it had some chapters that weren't relevant to the story...

This is my 2nd time reading the series (I read it for the first time almost exactly a year ago) and I was surprised at how fresh it felt. I wasn't feeling like ""hey I read this before,I know what's going to happen"" , but instead I relived all of the emotions as they were new. - I am not even going to explain how much I hate Umbridge .

Harry is full of teen angst and spends a lot of the book furious (and being quite infuriating) at the fact that nothing is happening, and that when things do happen, he's not allowed to be involved. Of course not being allowed do things should never stop a boy like Harry Potter from getting involved - except that amazingly it does.

This book, however, thrusts you head first into the deep end. You either learn to swim, or you drown. I always find myself thinking about how the movies even detect the switch. The lighting, for the first four movies, was bright and light. They gradually became darker. In both the movie and the book, this was the first installment where the darkness seemed to be a mai"

I love the introduction of new places (St Mungos! The Ministry!) and the expansion of characters old and new. I really want to work in the department of mysteries.

With each instalment to this series the emotions are heightened as I fear for an ever-increasingly large cast of ever-increasingly lovable characters. This is the book that gave us the hateful Umbridge and made us first realise our misplaced trust of authority. It is also the book that gave us the members of the Order of the Pheonix and showed us once again what tru

Summer 2003 came along, I had just graduated from college and I was anxiously awaiting the release of the fifth Harry Potter book. I was so anxious in fact that I actually fell for and spread around the story that volume 5 would be called “Harry Potter and The Green Flamed Torch.” Not one of my prouder moments. As soon as the book became available for"

It’s no longer my absolute favorite because I was bored through some of it. The middle part mostly was rather uneventful and it didn’t even contain parts that foreshadowed or held important information for its sequels. While some chapters are one of the best in the entire series, some were unnecessary. However I will never not give this book less than 5 stars because nostalgia. Listening to the audiobook!

There's action, drama, death, new characters, character development, world building, etc. The Order Of The Phoenix is a masterpiece. I don't understand why everyone hates Dolores Umbridge. She's one of the most unique bitches I've ever read about. She is so evil yet has so much class. The battle between Albus and Voldemort is one of my favorite scenes in this entire series. I can go on and on about"

It’s a very unique world and you can pretty much dive in and out of it when you want. Now on to the review: Basically this isn’t my favorite HP book because duh Sirius dies:(((.

It really showed how Neville was really trying and it was

I listened to the audiobook for Order of the Phoenix in the past, but unfortunately, I don't remember much from it.

I become fonder and fonder of CAPSLOCK HARRY as I grow older. When I was a teen reading this book, I remember rolling my eyes a little bit at him - why couldn't he just get on with it? - but since I was a teenager who should have been classified in the angstiest possible category, perhaps I needed the distance.

And I can say that I think I enjoyed it a lot more the second time around. I've always said this one was my least favorite in the series because it's a bit more depressing, Harry is so moody, and everything seems to be going wrong--oh, and Umbridge.

I kept up with the happenings enough to know who died and how by the end, but overall, this book sealed my opinion of Rowling and the books she was churning out. This book read like marshmallow fluff cranked out by a money-hungry layabout.

Rowling,1,"IT TOOK ME OVER A YEAR BUT IM FINALLY DONE WITH THIS MONSTER OF A BOOK AND IM SO GLAD ITS OVER I honestly didn’t think I’d ever finish this, it was such a ridiculously long story that was badly written, a super stretched plot (it REALLY didn’t need to be this long) and 99% of the characters I couldn’t stand since they either exaggerated every scene they were in or were just whining the whole way through. I started off by reading the physical book which was such a bad choice as I had the first edi"
987,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,1,"This is the worst Harry Potter book. The characterization is unbelievable and annoying, taking the various holes in the world J.K. has created with Harry Potter and throwing them in the face of the reader with the expectation that they will accept anything at this point. Events in the world that main characters (and by extension, the reader) find outrageous and crazy are accepted by everyone else in the world without adequate reasons for their acceptance. Harry whines incessantly throughout this"
988,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,4,"It's difficult to review Harry Potter as individual books because, in my opinion, J. K. Rowling wrote so well as a whole that I feel a difficult task to do. However, I will try it. In Harry Potter and the order of Phoenix, the protagonists aren't so innocent, especially because of the circumstances they have to face and In my opinion, this is the novel that marks the beginning of an increasingly and suffocating darkness that will grow until the climax of the seventh and last book. As a great fan"
989,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,5,"I feel like this book gives us two things: the greatest death in all of literature and the greatest villain in all of literature. That being said, I have always had a soft spot for Sirius. POA is my favorite of the entire series because the entire book is his introduction and it is the last ""innocent"" novel. So when he dies, I feel like my godfather is dying as well. I cry when I read the books, I cry when I watch the movies, and I'm sure if I continue on this long enough, I'll cry. Sirius is on"

I adore this series and I have adored rereading it so far but I have to say I think that this one is probably the one which felt most exciting to me as I've only read this once many, many years back and had almost entirely forgotten the second half of the book. Therefore, some of the events which happened terrified, enchanted and enraged me so much. I love seeing Sirius and Harry's relationsh"
997,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,4,"4.5 The ‘angry’ book. I personally didn’t mind Harry loosing his temper. When you consider his life and experiences up to this point, it is amazing that he hasn’t ‘lost’ it before! Rowling took a lot of the usual elements away in this instalment. Dumbledore and Hagrid are ‘absent’ for most of the book, leaving Harry alone/isolated to deal with difficult situations and feelings, which I guess is a part of growing up. Additionally, the Hogwarts Headmaster is shown to be ‘human’ after all and not an"
998,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,5,"My favorite. My absolute favorite book in the series. The double whammy of Voldemort and Umbridge, the first major death, Harry being defamed by the ministry, it's all too wonderful. And it turns out that my kids agree. This has been the one that has really gotten my daughter (who just turned 8) fully invested in the series, and my oldest son (11) who already knows the story also claims this as his favorite."

1001,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,5,"The 5th book about Harry Potter is no doubt the longest and, at least to me, the hardest one to read. Every scene is tinged, every happy moment soon ruined by new ugliness (or at least it feels that way). More than physical violence, the psychological effects of this novel are what make it so bad. We have severe bullying not just by students but also by teachers, most notably by Umbridge, plots, torturous longing, … basically, the situation is hopeless and Hogwarts feels less and less like a saf"
1002,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,5,"The longest book - by more than a hundred pages - in the series, many have complained that this is one of their least favorites. And I admit, it was my 2nd least favorite for a very long time. When I finally re-read it a few years ago, I revised my opinion. It's now one of my top favorites. When I first read it, as a young-adult, I was really annoyed with Harry's actions and attitude. I got frustrated with his frustrations and anger. It's funny that it took me getting older to actually become mor"
1003,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,4,"This is probably the best entry in the Harry Potter series to this point. In my personal opinion, the novels begin as average stories at best - with Rowling trying to gain a proper control over her writing voice and style. They do show delightful promise with the worldbuilding and some sense of nice-enough characters, but all in all it's clear that marketing played a huge hand in selling the books early on. I'm not cynical enough to say marketing was all that did it, Rowling has a distinctly Bri"

In a book filled with mental and physical struggles, friendship and courage help pull Harry through a life that was destined to be far from ordinary, when that is all he desires to be. This book makes you laugh out loud, most likely at Ron's immature comments, or at Luna's strange and yet charming demeanour. The next minute, it makes you angry, most likely at Umbridge's"

1017,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,4,"Quite an outstanding book. I felt like this one in particular focussed less on Harry fighting the evil around him and more on fighting himself. Don't get me wrong: he's irritating and whiny for almost the entirety of the book, but he also grows in a touching way. Dumbledore, too- he isn't present for much of the plot, but his conversation with Harry at the very end was heart-rending in an entirely different way. Altogether this is longer and darker than any book in the series previously, but it"
1018,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,5,"This 5th and longest book of the series describes the happenings after the Triwizard Tournament and return of Lord Voldemort. Not that many of the students believe the story of HeWhoMustNotBeNamed’s return. However, this 5th year is about so much more than school (although this is a crucial year what with the OWLs and career choices ahead) or a mystery to be solved. It’s about change, about growing older, about the stakes getting higher, growing danger and the human factor in everything. It’s ab"

This book never fails to bring me to tears - I think this was actually the first book which made me bawl my eyes out for a character or rather shed a tear while reading.

I know some people who complained about Harry being so angry in this book, but I think he has the right to be. He’s traumatized over Voldemort’s return and Cedric’s death, very few people believe he’s telling the truth about Voldemort, and he’s being kept in the dark by the people he trusts and cares about. The formation of Dumbledore’s Army is enjoyable because it finally gives Harry a chance to take on a leadership role, and his fellow students get to learn"

1033,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,5,"---2018 Reread Edit--- This book is still one of my favorites of all time because we see a more cynical and angry side to Harry, which is completely understandable due to the nature of the last four years he'd endured, and how everyone in the Wizarding community basically shut him out, slandering his name. Then again, the one ""issue"" I had towards Harry in this book still stands during this re-read: his horrible treatment of Ron & Hermione. They don't deserve his outbreaks, they're his most l"

At 870 pages, it is very laborious to get through this tome when every other sentence brings a new disaster/ problem for Harry. Drama is fine, but to this level at this length is just overdoing it.

1040,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,2,"SPOILERS AHEAD!! What. the. f***. Words can't begin to express my disappointment. I bought Mockingjay the first day it came out and I was preparing myself for a truly epic novel, one worthy of its predecessors. I loved The Hunger Games; it was fast-paced, thrilling, suspenseful. Catching Fire wasn't as good but it was still enjoyable (I was majorly impressed by the game arena). I wasn't let down by Catching Fire though; I figured it was just a transition novel, build-up to what would undoubtedly"

It's good, and yet not good. Because it’s good in a very heartbreaking, chilling, haunting, intense way. Katniss is a different person from the first two books. I found her softer, more thought"

Sadly, I can't say that I'll be recommending the series as fervently as I did after reading The Hunger Games .

There is an ending - but it is not as happy as most expected it to be. The rebels fought, they won.

The biggest problem for me was that Katniss seemed to grow some throughout the first and the second book, yet slid back and forth/up and down throughout this.

When I first read 'Mockingjay' I was a silly little fourteen year old, drunk up on the fast paced action and immediate danger Katniss faced in the first two novels. Given her weakness and exclusion from important events, not to mention my almost 12 month wait for its release, I was bitterly disappointed. Perhaps, reading now, I appreciate Mockingjay more because of my lower expectations. Perhaps it is because I can look at it in a new light. Perhaps its both. I will not delete my origin"

And I see that even up to the third Hunger Games movie, Lawrence still shows no sight of improvement, three movies come by, she still looks like a well fed model who just stands there looking pretty instead of a struggling brave heroine.

1101,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,"I guess, sometimes our emotional bones need to be re-broken in order to set them right. Maybe this was a common experience for those who read this book, but a lot of its most emotional points were like reading a bizarre dream about the last few years of my own life. I’m not going to go into it because that would be, like, an unacceptable amount of over-share, even for me. That’s just to say that I have no ability to be objective about it. This story: real or not real?"
1102,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,Re-read in December 2k15. Still amazed by how much I love this series. This book was beautifully written.

But I wasn't crying on page 100 (just after the h_____ is b_____ and Katniss speaks), my tear ducts are just really well-developed. Suzanne Collins is excellent at pacing,* avoiding the trap of overusing the cliffhanger or slowing down too much and losing attention. She has a graceful hand when using humor to ease tension - I especially liked the parts when one c"
1107,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,"I had considered not doing a review for this book, because really the series doesn't need any help whatsoever from me. It can stand on it's own just fine, but I feel an obligation to share my admiration and love for this series. Katniss has narrowly escaped the claws of the Capitol. She is the face of the rebellion and the strain of that responsibility shows. Nothing is clear cut, nothing is easy, and nothing makes sense. The suspense, the tension, and the electric air is apparent and it won't ma"
1108,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,"When I first read Mockingjay five years ago, I didn't like it very much. I thought the ending was rushed, I thought it was boring that Katniss spent so much time wandering around in a confused funk, and I thought it was much darker and more depressing than the previous books in the Hunger Games series But even though it was my least favorite of the trilogy, I decided to reread it after seeing both Mockingjay movies.* Surprisingly, I liked the book a little better this time around. The problems I"
1109,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,"Katniss final battle against Snow (and Coin?) in the overthrow of the Capital comes full center in the final volume of the Hunger Games. From a psychological point of view, the writer does a good job of showing how difficult a decision it is for her to take on the identity of the MockingJay - symbol of the revolution and the weight of its implications. I think that here we also see a bit more about the challenges of being in the spotlight and living up to others' expectations - often against one"
1110,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,"I literally forget 80% of this book. I *maybe* remembered 3 aspects of the plot. It was amazing and yes, terrifying, to read Mockingjay again. I remember reading it the first time thinking that it flew by really fast and I didn't think so this time. It was even more amazing the second time around. I know this isn't the most beloved book in the series, but it was pretty amazing in my opinion. All the stars."
1111,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,"Oh my gosh. I just finished this and one word of advice: Do not read this during history class. If you do, you will look incredibly awkward trying to suppress your sobs. This book sent me through a roller coaster of emotions and was a fast read for me, considering that I've had a lot of homework this week. I wouldn't say that it's as good as the first two, but it definitely holds its own and it was a great read. ""You love me. Real or not real?"" ""Real"""

Now District 13 has rescued Katniss and wants her to become the ultimate symbol of the rebellion as the Mockingjay. However, Snow still has someone close to her held captive, and Katniss fears that any move she makes to aid the uprising will hurt someone she cares about.

Though it wasn't very good, compared to Mockingjay it was a literary masterpiece. How bad is Mockingjay? I'm struggling to find words insulting enough. Here's how it starts: All her life Katniss has hated the Capital and now they've bombed her home into rubble, killing 90% of district 12. Does she demand vengeance? Uh...no. She's cranky people"

Keep in mind that I'm only one opinion here. Plenty of people didn't mind what Suzanne Collins did at the end of this book. Me? I can't think of a worse possible conclusion. Which hurts me to say, since Mockingjay was easily my most anticipated release this year. In the beginning, the premise of this book seems to be one girl (almost) single-handedly overthrow"

It is the last installment of The Hunger Games, following 2008's The Hunger Games and 2009's Catching Fire. The book continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, who agrees to unify the districts of Panem in a rebellion against the tyrannical Capitol. The novel was adapted into two films, with The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1 released in November 2014 and The Hunger Ga"
1118,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,"That ending had ruined me. This is definitely one of my favourite trilogies of all time. The reality of war and it’s aftermath embedded in the people was at the forefront here and I loved it. It was so real, and my heart broke the entire way through it."

However, I found it to be a fitting end to one of the best young adult series out there (and that is not a compliment to be taken lightly as I only love about 1/4 of the young adult books I read). The character of Katniss has evolved throughout the books and I think some are disappointed because she's not as bad ass as she was in the beginning of the trilogy. However, I think this is fittin"

1124,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,"Breathtaking. Collins has tied up her Hunger Games trilogy into a package that isn't pretty, but it's exactly as it needs to be. These were hard books, about a future where there was no hope, and a young girl who was thrust into the role of reluctant hero. But Katniss isn't perfect, isn't all-powerful or all-knowing. All she wants is to protect her family and those few people she thinks of as friends. In the course of doing so, terrible decisions have to be made. People are lost, relationships t"
1125,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,"This was an outstanding trilogy with an extraordinary heroine who was somehow made more ordinary for most of this story.

Initially acting out of defense for a beloved sister, the symbol of all that was right with her family, Katniss' bid for survival blossomed into a movement she isn't sure she supports.

I am at a complete loss, because the heartbreak I'm suffering from only mirrors a decimal of what Katniss, Peeta, Gale, and many other characters experienced. There is no happy ending to be found here. Mockingjay evokes a completely different set of emotions than The Hunger Games or Catching Fire . You will feel pity, you will feel anger, and you will feel despair. Hope is not present, not by a long shot. But most of all, I walk"

CHARACTERIZATIONS: I never found the character of Katniss to be very likeable, but she reaches an all-time low in this book, killing innocents without batting an eye. She is openly cruel, even to Peeta. The character assassinations don't stop with her, however; many characters are just destroyed in this book. I don't mean that they die (althou"
1130,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,"I genuinely never understand why people say that Mockingjay is bad. Those people, in my opinion, were reading this trilogy for the wrong reasons, because I believe wholeheartedly that Mockingjay is the most profound and poignant representation of war that I have ever read. The slow realisation that Coin is no better than Snow, Katniss's unwillingness to be the face of a revolution she unknowingly started, and the inescapable fact that war does not discriminate in its victims. Anyone and everyone"
1131,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,"The Hunger Games trilogy finishes with Mockingjay by Suzanne Collins. To me, in my humble opinion, this was not as powerful as the first two. Mockingjay wraps up the action, ties up all the loose ends and makes a fitting, if somewhat disjointed ending, but it lacks the relentless present tense subjective narrative of Katniss Everdeen. I was almost annoyed by Katniss in the first third of the book, Collins spending a great deal of time describing a self-loathing, spiritual funk. To her credit, Co"

I don't really think it is merely about the ending (although killing Primrose almost made me want to throw away the book). I guess it is also about what I have observed authors go through when ending their beautifully written trilogies.

Sadly, Ms Collins doesn't seem as good at keeping the tension high without that brilliant device that worked so well for the last two books.

After Katniss Everdeen survived the last Hunger Games in “Catching Fire,” she discovers that the Capitol had destroyed her home District 12 as a way to teach Katniss that she cannot defy the"
1174,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,2,"Mockingly is the third and final book in the Hunger Games trilogy. I will say this again, DNF is not an option for me wether I like the book or series or not. I have given this series 3 chances to whet my appetite or pique my intrest and this series has not done that. To me, this series does not deserve a review. Sorry guys, but this whole series was bad and very repetitive. I will not be reading this author again. Star rating for this book is a 2 Star rating for the whole series is a 3. Again sorr"
1175,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,"Perhaps my hopes were too high. Perhaps I had become so attached to the characters that I couldn’t stand to see them change so rapidly. Perhaps I didn’t like being in such a dark atmosphere, not that these books were ever light. I don’t know what the problem was for me, but whatever it was, it made Mockingjay a let down. Don’t get me wrong, I still loved it to pieces. But I was just expecting so much from this book and, frankly, I didn’t get it. Katniss, who was once so strong was so depressing a"
1176,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,"This series was, as i understand it, marketed as young adult. It's without doubt one of the darkest, most tragic things i've read in a long time. Being a teacher, I know plenty of young adults who could handle it, but do I think it betters them to do so? I'm not sure. I gave the others four stars, but this one earnt five. Powerful, emotive and deeply moving, mostly for the wrong reasons. Written beautifully, I was dragged along by this book, given neither the time nor the choice of putting it do"
1177,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,2,"My re-read experience definitely changed my opinion of this book slightly. It was still a rushed ending and some of the deaths were unnecessary, but I enjoyed it more than I expected to."
1178,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,"I am a complete mess right now , this book is the very definition of a powerful pain that tear up your insides but you don't want to get rid of it."
1179,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,1,"It's a harsh rating, I know. But only because I expected so much more from this book. I can't be ok with how things played out in this novel. The characters and this series as a whole, deserved more. I feel so underwhelmed right now. Mockingjay is a mere shadow compared to its predecessors. A series that lost its way. And by the third book, lost a lot of heart. Katniss has been through a lot, and so, it's only natural that war changes people. So I can understand if Katniss isolates herself from th"
1180,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,"I’m rating this as the third part of one story, so I’m basically rating the trilogy. Well, it took me a long time in this book, past the time when I thought I would have, because at that specific point I was probably too shocked to absorb the event enough to cry, but I did end up crying, quite a bit toward the very end. This book and this series is brilliant. Thank goodness Collins did a good job with the whole arc of the story through all 3 books. This is such a beautifully written story; it’s s"
1181,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,"As the final installment of a widely loved and thoroughly praised series, Mockingjay has proven to be a worthy conclusion. Not only does it meet the high expectations set by The Hunger Games and Catching Fire , but it's even more epic, bleak, suspenseful, heartbreaking and, ultimately, satisfying than its predecessors. In Mockingjay , the entire of Panem is the arena and Katniss finds that the true threats are more dangerous than any of the Capitol's manufactured muttations could ever be. Colli"
1182,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,2,"“Fire is catching! And if we burn, you burn with us!” Understand this; This was mediocre for a 'Hunger Games' novel, hence the 2-star rating. I expected more from Suzanne Collins than this epic failure of a book that doesn't manage to conclude the series. It failed to capture me and pull me in and I was wishing it would end and then I was disappointed because the ending was that much generic and ruined the entire thing for me. I really wanted to love this book and there were times that I did, bu"
1183,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,"Wow - just a real heart breaker and lots of...er...heart break. Suzanne Collins certainly doesn't pull any punches here and poor Katniss has been put through he**. I use to feel bad about my protagonists...not anymore, they have it sweet in comparison. I couldn't quite go the full 5 stars because of the violence - not that I'm overly sensitive about that (they're at war after all), but it's the kids vs. kids that gets me. I also thought it was interesting that when my daughter did a book report"
1184,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,Finished about 20 minutes ago and I still can't catch my breath.
1185,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,So much respect to Ms. Collins. SO MUCH. That's all I will probably ever say about this book.
1186,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,I have to say I liked the other two better. But the ending is so beautiful. I'm so glad they get there kind of happily ever after.
1187,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,An amazing ending...i dont know what to say
1189,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,"The first time I read Mockingjay, I thought it was rushed and didn't think it stood up to the first two books in the Hunger Games series. However, once I re-read it I found that the rushed feeling didn't come from a hurried and cramped writing style (as many fans suggest - they think Collins rushed to meet a deadline), but from the sense of urgency that Suzanne Collins masterfully injected into the battle scenes. It's a war told from the point of view of one girl, so of course during the scenes"
1190,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,"For YA fiction, this is pretty intense. Quite a few bloodstains to clean up. Overall, though, I was somewhat exasperated at the recycled use of the premise from the first two novels. I felt like whole “extreme makeover: warrior edition” thing might have worked really well in the Games arena, but when the Mockingjay takes on the Capitol itself, it seems to come off a bit thin and worn out. To buy that a 17 year-old kid with bad skin is the pivotal player in a war between the Galactic Empire and t"
1191,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,1,"Seeing the movie reminded me how much I loathe this book. Mockingjay, also known as: the best characters die, Katniss is a pain in the neck, Katniss is really confused when it comes to men, Gale's character is completely ruined and Peeta isn't really there. Oh and remember, everything is okay if in the end (view spoiler) [you have two little babies, aw. I wouldn't want Katniss near babies, not even if they paid me. (hide spoiler) ] But ehi, it's fine 'cause war is really really bad but 20 years late"
1192,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,"What an amazing ending! And it's so realistic. The Hunger Games triology is on my top ten shelf. When I finished reading it this morning, I was shivering and crying. This is not a love story. This is story about surviving, political games and individual fates in the machinery of the repressive society which always wants sacrifice for whatever they describe as the ""greater good"". Maybe this book is labeled as dystopian but everything in it is real. We live it now - just watch the news."
1193,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,1,I was bored. The characters I'd once loved for their colour and fire fell flat. The plot ended with a cop out and above all I just didn't care by the time I got to the last page. A big disappointment considering how much I loved the first book in the Hunger Games series.
1194,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,"Reread 11/11/15: Still amazing. I laughed/cried/etc. I can't wait for the movie next week, I hope it does justice to the ending of this wonderful series! Perfect ending to a spectacular trilogy. I will read these books over and over and over!"
1196,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,Wow... teary conclusion. This was a great series. I enjoyed the story and I enjoyed the characters.
1197,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,2,...And that's pretty much it.
1198,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,Can't stop crying...
1199,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,Wasn't disappointed with this book. Very awesome. I'll be interested to see how the movie does...lets all hope that they don't turn out like the twilight movies.
1200,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,"Note: These reviews are old and need updating. I might do that soon. CAUTION : This review contains spoilers (marked accordingly). I should divide the third book in two because I really loved the first 2 parts but I don't know about the last one. Even though some people didn't like Katniss's breakdown, for me it was the right reaction.. She lost some friends, she almost lost her life, she lost the one she loved (but still didn't know that she loved him o_O). She's been through Hell.. twice.. and I"
1201,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,"This series is one of my all-time favourites, but I couldn’t help but be a little disappointed at its conclusion. First of all, the thing I really loved was the Hunger Games itself. I loved the tension and suspense, the arena, the cannons going off, all the horrors the Capitol could conjure up and the gradual tracking down of the remaining tributes. (No, I am not a psychopath.) And Mockingjay didn’t have any of that; Mockingjay was all about the war. So I was a teeny bit disappointed with that. Se"
1202,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,1,"CONTAINS SPOILERS* I'm so so sorry I read this, I used to love the series, but now... I don't think I'm going to be able to open those books anymore, how? if just by looking at them I feel like crying, I knew the end was going to be sad, but I didn't expect it to be CRUEL, I knew from the start that Katniss and Peeta were going to end up together, it's just how she (Suzanne Collins) did it, that I think it was a very low move. I knew she would try to get every Gale fan in Team Peeta's board, but she"
1203,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,"Simply Amazing! Mockingjay was everything I hoped for and so much more. It lived up to all the hype, it's reputation to being the most talked about, the most anticipated and the most wanted book of the year. You thought The Hunger Games and Catching Fire was vividly real? Wait till you get this book in your hands! With a lot of twists I never saw coming, this one will blow your ever loving mind! It's astounds me how well plotted this entire series is penned. It leaves you breathless. I am emotion"
1204,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,1,"I loved The Hunger Games, was hugely disappointed by Catching Fire and Mockingjay just felt... weak. I think what annoyed me most (as it did in the second book) is how selfish Katniss is. Her character was quite likeable in the first book but it became one dimensional and very unlikeable somewhere in the second book. War is raging around her and her constant self-centered issues become tiring really fast. There is some action in the book but the story in itself is unsurprising and the anti-war s"
1205,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,"As many others do, I have mixed feelings on this book. There's no doubt that Suzanne Collins is fantastic author. Her characters are no less interesting to me in this book. And unlike many others, I actually don't hate the plot of this book. The cruel ending to Prim's story fit with the message of the book in a way that I both love and hate. But this book is frustrating because there's no clear way for the characters to win. Even the ending we wish for, district 13 winning, turns out to be just"
1207,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,"There are not many times that I read a series that I wish would continue with more books, but the Hunger Games is one of those series that I feel that way about. The whole trilogy gets a well-deserved 5-star rating."
1209,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,2,"UPDATED REVIEW (27/09/13) WARNING- CONTAINS SPOILERS Am I the only one who is disappointed after reading this??? We all know that Collins had brought out the first book, The Hunger Games in the series which gained popularity within months. Why wouldn't it? It had an innovative plot, a brave heroine, action-packed pages, resurgence of dystopian fiction etc. etc…..but as the series proceeded I felt that Collins was eventually losing hold over the plot. It was like she had no idea how the series wou"
1210,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,"With Mockingjay, we start off where Catching Fire left us: Katniss is with the rebels and the Capitol has imprisoned Peeta. Katniss is now living in District 13 and refusing to be the rebels' Mockingjay. It takes Peeta calling for an end to the resistance for her to finally agree to be the Mockingjay and calls for immunity for her fellow tributes when they are rescued. Once she has finally come to the decision, President Coin puts her to work and Katniss is sent to District 8 to visit with the w"
1211,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,"I was so excited to go to my local bookstore's midnight release party for MOCKINGJAY. I hadn't been to a midnight release party for quite awhile and it's such a singular experience, wandering the aisles and just soaking up the high pitched excitement and general camaraderie in the air. And this time I got to do it all with my always-up-for-a-good-time sister Liza and the lovely Holly from Book Harbinger. Together the three of us admired the radical Capitol hairstyles, watched the archery contest"
1212,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,"Going into this book, I was very much aware that reader opinion about it was deeply divided, and had picked up bits and pieces of partial ""spoilers,"" though not enough for me to predict exactly how events would turn out. Within my own friend circle, ratings ranged from five stars to one, with some people praising the novel to the skies and others feeling that Collins dropped the ball badly. Having now read it and made my own call, I have to agree that she did drop the ball, big time. But my reas"
1214,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,"Mockingjay by Suzanne Collins is the third and final book in her hugely popular Hunger Games trilogy. Note: This review contains spoilers for all three books, so if you haven't read the books, you might not want to read this review. Katniss Everdeen survived the brutal Hunger Games not once, but twice, but Katniss is weary and heartsick for so many reasons -- Peeta, the boy who helped her through the games, is being held hostage by the Capitol; her home district was firebombed to ashes by the Capi"
1215,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,"This is a book that not only holds up on a second reading, but also absolutely deserves a reread. The week before Mockingjay was released in 2010, I called around to different bookstores trying to find one that was having a midnight release. When all ten chain and indie stores said they weren't having one, I called back from a private number and, with an Eliza Doolittle meets Mary Poppins accent, asked if they were willing to sell me a copy one day in advance if I paid double. I know, I have zero"
1216,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,"I had heard from others, without giving away any of the plot, that the ending of the trilogy was unsatisfying. So, I braced myself for something that would disappoint me or make me mad. There was one part that had me pretty upset, but that was part of the twist in the story that I never saw coming. That doesn't mean I was happy about it or that I wished the author would have made it more of a happier outcome. However, ultimately I found that I was at peace, like Katniss, about the ending. Though"
1217,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,2,"I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 because of the other books. I think the others are amazing, but I found that this one (while true to the reality of war) altered the true nature of so many characters. the story was drawn out, the real arc of the climax was just before the end, and the end was down right horrible. Yeah I didn't expect flowers and bon bons, but I didn't expect her to start the series off by having katniss saving her sister by sacrificing herself only to see prim BLOWN UP at the en"
1218,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,1,"Chapter x Chapter on my blog. This wasn't a book about a girl becoming an inspiring figure for her people and fighting against an oppressive regime. This was a story about a girl getting yanked here and there, taking no initiative over her own life, and letting other people dress her up in pretty clothes and then tell her where to go. Also, wars are impressive. (Morally right or wrong, they still make for epic stories.) The media people who get down and dirty in wars to document it are in impressi"
1219,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,"I stare down at my shoes, watching as a fine layer of ash settles on the worn leather. re-visit 2018 as US is still under its own version of Snow and Coin, and the young and diverse hashtags rise up at the horror of it all."
1220,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,"Real or Not Real? Definitely real. Really, really real. And EPIC. This book exceeded all of my expectations for a 3rd book in a series. What an excellent way to end a trilogy. It was an emotional ride. There are absolutely no words to describe how I felt while I was reading this book. The floor is littered with tissues. My eyes are red and puffy. I am drained. Yet, I am satisfied and happy with the outcome. Suzanne Collins – you are a masterful author. You crafted a wonderfully dark book about a w"
1221,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,"Why oh why do authors so love to play with my emotions? I'm a very sensitive being, I tell you! 😭 In any case, Mockingjay was absolutely gorgeous. It was the perfect ending to the trilogy, with just as much action as the last two installments. I haven't seen a endling this perfect since The Death Cure and that's saying something."
1222,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,Ending was rushed. Audiobook Comments Read by Carolyn McCormick and she absolutely nailed this audio. Loved listening to this series. Blog | Instagram | Twitter
1224,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,"I must say one thing... It definitely wasn't as good as I thought it'd be. I mean, I cried once so, I suppose that shows that I had some emotional attachment linked to this book, but that's pretty much it. If you're wondering, I cried when Finnick died, and the lack of mention of this character after his demise, is probably what at least knocked half a star off this review. I guess the only reason I'm writing this, is because I need to vent, and I have no one to talk to, because either I read ver"
1226,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,"This was a long, painful ride filled with sorrow and adventure. I can't believe that I have finally read this series after so long. I feel like I accomplished something huge, I finally finished one of the trilogies that I am guilty about not reading. It was not one of those fluffy, happy books but more of a powerful and epic book. It had so many parts where I cried, a few times when I laughed but mostly, I was crying. If you haven't heard about this book, it is the third book in The Hunger Game"
1227,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,"I think I can talk about this now. This book exists entirely in emotional textures for me. It’s like how a song can become so closely entwined with emotional response so you don’t know what is coming from the music and what is welling up from that breathless perfect moment you first heard it. This is always going to be the book I was reading when my girlfriend got her cancer diagnosis. I don’t have a lot of my usual tools here, is what I’m saying. So, okay. Things I love. I love the way this book"
1228,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,"This review contains some spoilers Over the past eight days or so I’ve been involved in a Hunger Games audiobook marathon. I finished listening to the last installment this afternoon and I’ve been torn between waiting for the book to settle in my head and wanting to write a review while my impressions remain strong. The second option has won out. I don’t know what I expected from this book, but whatever it was, I’ve not been disappointed. This is not a fairy tale where good conquers evil and ever"
1229,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,"I'm waffling on a rating. For now 3.5/5 stars because I'm mad. But that could change tomorrow! LOL well... dam. I'm feeling a bit, I don't know? Dishelveled? Distraught? Discomfuckingbobulated? I'm mad, I know that much. I do have to give kuddos to Collins though. She didn't pull any punches. If you were hoping for delicious Coffee light and sweet, all your gonna get is dark, black and bitter. I saw the climax coming with Coin, but there were more than a few surprises. The deaths. At one point in"
1231,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,"“You love me. Real or not real?"" I tell him, ""Real.” I know that some people don't particularly like Mockingjay, but I loved it. Was it as good as Catching Fire ? Nope. Was it still good? Yes. What I really loved about this book was the fact that we got to see Katniss's fragile state. In my opinion, it was realistic. That girl is still a teenager and she went through so much, you can't expect her to not have PTSD after winning one hunger game and having to go through another. Katniss Everdeen is"
1232,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,3.5 stars! My least favorite out of all three but I love the epilogue so much. The last line is so haunting!

1234,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,2,"I'm really torn on what to rate this book. I went back and forth between 2 and 3 stars a few times, but I ended up going with 2 stars for a variety of reasons that I hope I'll be able to convey. I don't think that it was terrible, I was disappointed and irritated by quite a lot of it. I will try not to spoil the plot, but if you haven't read the book, read the following at your own risk: First things first... In The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, I cared about Katniss and Gale and Peeta. They we"
1235,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,"Mocking Jay has a lot more in common with 1984 than it does Harry Potter. If you read this book without that in mind, you’re missing the key element of the trilogy that marks it as classic. Finally after all the waiting, my desire for serious political commentary is met and I am left with the sickening fear and tension of high stakes reality. Yes, Orwell, Collins understands. The general review is now over, only proceed if you’ve read the book or like spoilers. “It’s a republic, ma’am, if you ca"
1237,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,"I had posted a fairly long review, but now that I casually checked, turns out GR ate it and it isn't shown! Anyway, to sum up the long review in one phrase: The book is more flawed than the previous two, and the flaws (worldbuilding and handling of the conclusion to the saga) do take away from Mockingjay , yes, but not to the extent it ruins the trilogy as far as I'm concerned."
1238,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,2,"So then. This is it. This is where I wave goodbye to my young adulthood. Time to gather my things and move on. I have learnt its forthcoming wisdoms. I've been awakened but allowed to snooze. I have been jolted rather than shocked. I have wept saltless tears and laughed silent smiles. I have learnt of love and death, of governments and dreams, of friendship and betrayal, of fate and choice. One last wave. One look back. No regrets. No more Bacardi Breezers that coat the stuff that really hits yo"
1240,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,"More of my reviews can be found at Flipping Through the Pages ! When I finished this book I felt drained and I felt tired. Okay, so I was pleased with the fact that I had this patiently waiting to be read in my bookshelf right after I finished Catching Fire. The first two books, I loved, they bought out so much emotion in me and hooked me into Katniss' world straight away. But with this one... I don't know, I still absolutely loved it and I'll definitely reread it in the near future, but it just di"
1241,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,"The final book of the trilogy is so intense, complex, packed with actions and emotions, Heart touching, heartbreaking and near to heart. “It takes ten times as long to put yourself back together as it does to fall apart.” Katiness development is one hella treat to watch from a simple girl who hunts to survive to a rebel, her choices, her actions and emotions are so relatable and close to reality, She is one of the examples that it doesn’t matter how many people you have killed in certain situatio"
1242,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,2,"Review also published at My Bookshelf is Ready . Wow, this book was hard to get through. Not because of all the violent character deaths, but because there was something so dull about the novel. I'm not kidding when I say that Mockingjay read like a piece of fan fiction. It is written in the author's tone but there is that certain something missing here that was present back in the Hunger Games, but truthfully started waning in Catching Fire before it righted itself toward the end of the sequel. M"
1243,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,1,"1. The narrator mentions ""cheese buns"" in reference to something from the past books that she shares in common with Peeta. I thought it was ""cheese bread"" in the other books. The bakerboy makes cheese breads, which the main character likes. ""Cheese buns"" sounds borderline kinky and suggestive. 2. The unit is number ""451"". SO TRITE. This is obviously a reference to Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, or the temperature at which books BURN. Maybe like the temperature This Book Should Be Burned?? 3. ""Pane"
1244,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,"My wife told me I flew through this series. By most accounts, I wouldn’t consider myself a speed reader, but I can certainly dedicate the time to read a good book, or in this case, a great series. And after finishing The Hunger Games trilogy, I can honestly say this series has it all. The characters, the setting, action scenes galore, great dialogue, and we lived in Katniss’s head for the entire three-book ordeal. What a fresh, wonderful character who wouldn’t take crap from anyone. (view spoile"
1245,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,"A brilliant, heart-wrenching fictional account about the horrific psychological implications of war. Ms. Collins third installment of her Hunger Games series gives us something the first two books only hinted at--the deep scars left behind by a society in love with violence. Forget Team Peeta/Team Gale. By the end of this book you are only Team Humanity. I was up till 1:32 a.m. finishing up Katniss' Heroes Journey and I doubt I'll be as emotionally affected by another novel anytime soon. It is now"
1247,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,"3.5/5 stars. The ending was kind of meh. It wasn't a bad ending, I was just expecting a little more. I was a little disappointed with some parts. The middle part was just so slow. I was kind of struggling to read through it. This was a great series. And I highly recommend to read it if you haven't yet. It's not exactly my favorite but I'm so glad that I read it. It just didn't give me the same heartache/love feelings and emotions like I had when I read ""Legend"" trilogy by Marie Lu."
1248,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"I've read a lot of fantasy, and I've spent a lot of time looking for fantasy that won't disappoint. When fantasy disappoints me, it usually does so predictably: either the world is poorly-built, the entire story is derivative, it is filled with creepy repressed sexuality, or the Hat Trick. An equestrian friend of mine suggested this series: it was one of her favorites. However, her suggestion was somewhat tentative. She had previously passed Eragon and Eye of the World along to me, which are so d"

By the way, I am sorry for comparing a half-giant (Hagrid) to a highly intelligent magical horse (Rolan). Despite all of the similarities to Harry Potter - and there are more than those I mentioned already, this book is not one of the countless Harry Potter clones. For once it was written exactly ten y"

I rather wish he'd just given me a Barnes & Noble gift card instead. From a purely technical perspective, this is possibly the worst published book I've ever read. From an emotional standpoint, this comes in a close third after some horrible book whose title I cannot recall, and Frankenstein. But back to Arrows of the Queen. Good grief. The highlights: 1. I am forced to put the plot as the first casualty, as"

We would curl up with our pillows stacked behind our backs and read books and eat ice cream and fall asleep whenever we wanted to. I loved it. And, unsurprisingly, the tradition continued on until I left home. One particular time I remember it was a Friday night and I was fourteen and my mom and I went to the base library to see what we could find. I wandered down the aisles and stopped w"
1252,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"Executive Summary: This book is super trope-heavy and not always the best written, but I found it a light, fun, quick read that seemed to suit my current mood. 3.5 stars. Full Review I’ve heard of Mercedes Lackey, but none of her books had made it onto my to ever growing to read pile. If not for Sword & Laser I probably never would have read this. This is one of those books that read at a different point, I might have been bored by. I’ve been a bit burnt out on reading lately and this seemed"
1253,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"I’ve always vaguely known about Mercedes Lackey’s work, but rarely read any, so this was my first experience with Valdemar. I’m aware that there are tons of problematic things about Mercedes Lackey’s body of work, though I haven’t looked at details. Still, Arrows of the Queen is a book I wish I’d had when I was younger.

1255,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"ORIGINALLY POSTED AT Fantasy Literature . Talia is not like normal 13-year-old girls. She likes to read adventure stories and she fantasizes about being a Herald for the queen of Valdemar. She does not want to get married to one of the dreary men in her village. So, when a Companion — one of the blue-eyed white horses who belongs to a Herald — shows up without a rider, Talia is happy to help him find his way home and stunned to learn that she’s been chosen to be trained as a Herald.

1256,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"An entertaining, easy-read coming of age story in which Talia escapes her difficult family to train as a Herald, complete with magical powers and an even more magical horse. The main strength here is the protagonist - Talia is sympathetic and I enjoyed reading about her, but I did feel that the more talents got heaped on her in the second half of the book the less interesting she was, and the more she started to feel like a fantasy heroine rather than an actual person. Another positive is the ge"

I finally started working on them. I remember Joan telling me to start with these then follow with the Magic's Pawn subset. This book had several strong female characters, including the main character. It reminds me very much of the Tamora Pierce series I read lately starting with Terrier . This was good clean fantasy. I don't feel compelled to rush o"
1258,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"(Reread in 2015 just because.) This book introduces the reader to what I consider a sort of proto-Valdemar. It's the author's first book of the series, her first novel entirely if I remember correctly, and after having read some of her later works, I can say that it shows. It's not quite as polished and refined as what she writes later on down the road, but the seeds of an expansive world are sown here and it's interesting to see. It isn't very action-heavy, so those looking to this as a sword-and"

It isn't my favorite (Kero's tale has that honor), but it comes very very close. I re-read this book (and the rest of the trilogy) probably about once a year, and I never get tired of them. Don't be fooled by the childish looking covers, this trilogy deals with some VERY adult themes.. child abuse, death, torture, sex, war, rape, murder... but it does i"

I love this, and I keep urging him to keep at it; one of the ways I encourage him is to ask him about his world which then sets him off on an hour-long discussion about some very important yet seemingly-small details about something that happened in this world a thousand years ago. We got to talking about his main character, a femal"

1265,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,Solid feel-good fantasy about a young woman coming of age. Strongly reminiscent of Alanna: The First Adventure and Dragonsinger for me.

1267,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,1,"Oh my god. This book was so fucking stupid. I can't believe I finished it. I've been on a streak of bad books lately but this one takes the cake. ARROWS OF THE QUEEN has absolutely no plot, no plot points, no character development, no climax, and overall nothing good about it. I am not even over exaggerating. Here's what happens in the story. Talia gets welcomed into a royal castle and becomes a part of the Queen's army. She then goes to classes every day and talks to people inside the castle's g"
1269,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"3 1/2 stars. Arrows of the Queen was a light little fantasy read that I truly wish I had picked up when I was younger; it was exactly the sort of story I used to day-dream about. This is no mind blowing piece of work, but it definitely had enough to keep me enchanted despite its many clichés. This was also very clearly a set-up book, and I have faith that the rest of the series and works of Lackey improve in writing and in plot. Probably my least favorite part about this book were how many chara"

1274,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,1,"I would give this a 1.5 if I could because I did enjoy the beginning of this book, if nothing else. I was sorely disappointed with this book, as I am a fan of Mercedes Lackey's other books. This novel seemed rushed, as if the only reason for it was to set the scene for the next novel in the series. The beginning seemed promising. I was truly interested in following this girl's journey. However, it quickly degenerated into something barely readable. Much of this girl's life was glossed over. When"
1275,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"Today this book gets dumped into the YA category, which is probably wrong. YA is a relatively new definition and, at least to me, refers to a much older age category. This books target audience seems to be young teen or even pre teen. If I wwere a REAL young adult and somebody gave me this book and said 'this book's for you', I would feel pretty insulted. That aside, it's not a bad book.

It reminded me of why I love fantasy and what got me into the genre to begin with. I only wish I found it earlier. I'm going to read the next two books in the trilogy. Maybe I'll write something more in-depth later, but this is mostly it while I'm on the iPad. One thing I found interesting was that this book didn't have the traditional story arc that I'"
1277,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"This book put me in pigtails. I read this with the joy of finally getting around to a Mercedes Lackey title. Her two rolls of novels on the library shelve was extremely intimidating, and a barrier from my adding her to my TBR pile. But it is good to show some love to a writer who wrote in such a timely manner, as opposed to the latest tend of a book every five or seven year. The book had a nice pace, taking a young girl from a bad situation to a magical place with a super powered horse. It sound"
1278,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"I absolutely adored all of Lackey's Valdemar novels when I was an adolescent, but a lot of them are a little too emo for me now. I still truly enjoy her first trilogy, the Arrows of the Queen, despite the fact that it shows Lackey's inexperience. I often feel that an author's first book is frequently his or her best, and I believe this to be true of Lackey. Talia and Dirk were always my favorite characters in all of Lackey's books, and this trilogy is the only series they are featured in. (They b"
1279,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"Really solid fantasy story! The overall concept of and world-building were nice for such a short story. It really felt like Lackey packed in a ton without it feeling too info-dumpy or rushed. I thought the best part of the story was Talia, which can be rare-ish with fantasy stories for me. Main characters in fantasy are sometimes really...uninteresting? They tend to blur together. Talia was great though, such a distinct character, which I always always always appreciate! She wasn't the usual fie"
1280,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"I really enjoyed this book! Don't get me wrong -- we don't get the most intricate world, the dialogue is often flat, descriptions really show rather than tell -- but Arrows the Queen basically fulfills all of my girlish childhood fantasies. To be the savior of a kingdom, fated for something great, earn love and respect from your peers, AND have a magical bonded horse to boot? Sign me up!! This, and the fact that Mercedes Lackey was also way ahead of her time for the 1980s (go girls!) made this s"
1281,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,1,"Arrows of the Queen was newly available on Hoopla, and I'd never read any Lackey, so I thought I'd give it a shot. This is the sort of book my sister would have loved when she was a teenager: a perfect and misunderstood 13-year-old. A school that accepts her. AND HORSIES!!!! It's a thin plot about horses that have some sort of ancient personalities, and they attach to humans, and they're trying to stop evil machinations that all happen off stage. It's so lightweight. And what's also lightweight"
1282,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"So, the thing about re-reading a beloved favorite book for the first time in, let's be honest, almost a decade (ugg, how am I old enough to write that sentence), is that sometimes they're not quite as good as your remember. I read Arrows of the Queen for the first time my freshman year of high school (and promptly gave my copy to the bf, who was the one who bought the copies of the books I'm now reading, fourteen years later, full circle baby) (oh dear, it's going to be one of those reviews, I s"
1283,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"Another blanket review, this one for all ""Arrows"" books. The rating is from my 12-year-old self, and she emphatically recommends them to all 12-year-old girls who lean toward fantasy. Being a horse-crazy preteen, I was, of course, ALL about these first Valdemar books. Insanely so. They're far more accessible than the Pern books, the language isn't as stilted or formal, the plotlines aren't utterly simplistic, but neither are they so convoluted as to be impenetrable to a 12-year-old. The characte"
1284,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"I love it! The characters are so very likeable, the Companions are just awesome and the story is very engrossing and I could easily get lost in it. :) I really love the idea of the Companions and that they Choose someone (and, from what I gathered, often saved their Heralds from dire situations while doing so) and basically give them a second chance for having a good life. Yes, Heralds have a dangerous life and often die young (as we see in this book *sobs*) but compared to their old lives and ju"
1285,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"3.5 stars? If you are a fan of fantasy, this is a good comfort read. Lots of likeable characters, intrigue, magic, horses--what's not to like? I didn't upgrade it to 4 stars because it didn't seem very original (for example, mistreated teen turns out to be the ""Chosen One"") and because there weren't really any twists. Everything was pretty straightforward and was wrapped up neatly at the end. However, these same qualities contribute to its being what I call a good comfort read. I'll probably rea"

1287,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"This book was my first fantasy read since Harry Potter. It painted an amazing picture that had elements of magic, but not so much that it made the plotline unbelievable. Talya's transformation from quiet shy adolescent child too confident young woman was Not only believable but extraordinary. Magic came in the form of magical horses which was very appealing to me as I was horse crazy since I was a young kid. This book left you in a state of wonder as to what may happen next.

1290,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"I really enjoyed this book. The reason I gave it only 3 stars is that sometimes the writing and the story are a little too simple and you can tell the writer is inexperienced. That and the huge cliche of the small, miserable child, who gets chosen for a grand destiny."

I have a paperback copy somewhere in the basement that I never read, which was purchased long, long ago.

I admit that I was a bit apprehensive when I started listening to the audiobook. Would I hate it now? Would I find Talia too much of a Mary Sue to be endured? I loved this book and this series so much and it added a great deal to my personal and spiritual growth in my younger days. Looking at it now, I have to admit that Talia is just a bit too perfect in this first book. Lackey learned a lot from this series and"
1293,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"Not a bad story, but nothing outstanding. I was enamored with it (as with most Valdemar stories) when I first read it, years ago, as one of my first fantasy stories. Now, decades later, with hundreds of other fantasy stories behind me, not so much. I like the heroine, Talia. I sympathize with her self-doubts and her reticence, and her desperate attempts to fit in. The first part of the book was actually pretty good. Unfortunately, when the second part rolled in, the protagonist suddenly changed,"
1294,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"Revisiting this story like an old friend, I was pleased to be reminded how much of the series is foreshadowed here. Not only is Vanyel's story the historic tale that inspires Talia in her dreams of Heraldry, but Albrecht's life and the Tedrel Wars are both very present as immediate influences on the events of this first novel. The arc of not only Talia's story but Elspeth's is hinted at here, and I wonder how much Lackey knew even in this first book about the world of Valdemar. In a way, this is"
1295,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"An utterly delightful YA novel about what I've come to think of as the standard trope: a sad young girl discovers that she has a magical pet that loves her best, and her whole life changes. And yet: all tropes have origins. And just as no one could accuse Tolkien of being derivative, just so can no one accuse Lackey, because I'm fairly sure she is one of the inventors of this particular sub-genre. The fact that the story normalizes gay relationships too is a nice bonus. I kept being surprised it"
1296,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"I did find the story rather too contrived and frankly a bit maudlin in places. There was little action and apart from the main protagonist the characters would have benefited from more depth. Although it wasn't awful, I think I'm probably a little too old now for this particular series, so I probably won't bother with the rest."
1297,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,I tend to love Mercedes Lackey so I wasn't surprised to like this one. One of the complaints I generally have for her though is that she tends to go over such vast time spans so quickly and that characters tend to develop bonds so quickly that you don't really get to see the how/why. Still I thought that this was a good read and I'm excited to move forward with the series.
1298,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"I was looking for a fantasy book that didn't involve war for a change, and here was the perfect one. I felt the pace was a bit fast and there was some episodes within the book that were glossed over so I found it a little hard to really get to know the characters. Other than that though, I enjoyed it, and 12-year-old-me is gutted I didn't read it back then!"
1299,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"This is a real classic fantasy series, one of the earliest I remember reading, and it really holds up. Sensational in its gay rep for the time period too. This was the first Valdemar book I read and I will always have emotional attachment to it even if I think the Magic's Pawn/Price/Promise ones are actually better."
1300,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"Probably my biggest complaint of this book is the way time passes. Months go by with a few words. This just over 300 page book occurs over the span of 3.5 years. The characters mature well throughout this time, but reading it and suddenly thinking, “wait, how much time has passed?” wasn’t the most enjoyable. Also can’t believe the Bury Your Gays trope existed in 1987 smh"
1301,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,That was fun! I was a little surprised that the Companion didn’t have much of a role? But I’m excited to read the rest of these!
1302,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"Genre: Epic Fantasy Terry Brooks, Robert Jordan, David Eddings, and other popular male authors where about it for Epic Fantasy exposure when I was first starting out in the genre. So it came as a shock when the allure of a female voice was so addicting after being bombarded with male writing—in fact Lackey was the first female EF author I had ever read back when.  It was a shock to read a book that actually had emotions and plots that worked with them.  Of course the idea of mystical horses that"
1303,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"So after a week spent reading Patrick Rothfuss, I felt a longing for the fantasy I choose for myself as a teenager. It wasn't this book, but Owlflight and Brightly Burning that drew me in and refused to let go, but like many series in outdated country libraries, they didn't have all the books. Maybe they did at some point, but over the years theft and use had dwindled the collection down to a few titles. It is with great shame that in my adulthood I haven't hunted more of these down, now I have"

I remember feeling very intrigued by empathy being a ""gift"". Even after figuring out that I wasn't as into Mercedes Lackey anymore, this book still held a special place in my heart. So you can imagine that I was incredibly disappointed with this read through. I remember having certain thoughts when I was younger. Why didn't I know that Cheryl was into Keren until I suddenly"
1305,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"Magic horses, guys. I really love the Valdemar books. They are a little bit fluffy and wish fullfillment-y, but they are a lot of fun and oddly progressive in a lot of ways. Valdemar is kind of the perfect fantasy kingdom in a lot of ways, with a monarchy, but a monarchy run by people who are guaranteed to be good people, at least, even if it doesn't always promise that they will be good rulers.

It's chock full of telling-not-showing and extraneous adverbs. It lacks narrative structure. Our heroine is unbelievably gifted and also under-appreciated in that way that adolescent readers really relate to. Except not really, because everyone loves the living crap out of her (she just doesn't realize it). Its lack of technical proficiency is actually kind of endearing, in that it reminds me o"

Even the Vanyel books are light-years ahead of this charming but dreadfully slight exercise in wish-fulfillment. I don't think it's *bad*, mind you.

1315,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,I found this book to be a let down as well as a bit confusing. I never really solidified in my mind who was who and that really took me out of the book. I found a lot of similarities to Alanna but without the special magic that Alanna has. Still this was an interesting read and I'll probably continue the series. The first chapter of the book really turned me off initially because it seemed like it too similar to a religion that I dislike and don't agree with. Thankfully by the second or so chapter

I don't want to examine my love of this book too closely for fear that I'll lose some of the shine, but if you're considering"
1320,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"This review has been crossposted from my blog at The Cosy Dragon . Please head there for more in-depth reviews by me, which appear on a timely schedule. Talia has been freshly Chosen, but she doesn't understand what that means. Thrown into the dangerous world of the court of Queen Selenay, she must find her feet quickly or drown in the doing so. Talia is one of the strong female heroines that makes Lackey's writing so powerful for me. Her shaky beginnings only make her better in my eyes, and her l"
1321,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"I just finished reading this about ten minutes ago; it took me less than a day to read and I have to say it was very well worth it. I came rather late to the whole Heralds-book-thing, Arrows of the Queen being the first one I've read and it was published twenty-five years ago. I remember all my friends reading books either from this series or any of the other half-dozen or so series of books that Mercedes Lackey wrote that were based in the same world, and they do seem to be the sort of story I"
1322,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"Recommended for: preteens obsessed with horses, emotionally troubled teenagers I have been rereading some of the books I read as a kid, but have completely forgotten after being bonked on the head. As I read the first half of the book, all I could think was ""Wow. This lady knows exactly what she is doing."" It is perfectly written to appeal to a lonely child. As an adult, I know that relationships derive their meaning (in part) from the time we put into them. A lonely child, however, will latch on"
1323,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"Authors' first books are often not very good. Thankfully, Mercedes Lackey's first book is not actually bad . Arrows of the Queen is readable, if often slow and almost completely lacking in plot (the ending surprised me because, well, there wasn't one). I wouldn't recommend reading this book for its own sake, but if you're interested in the Heralds of Valdermar series and you want to start from the beginning, go for it--just know that later books, although similar, are better. Don't let this rough"
1324,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"Pretty darn good. It seems there are a number of fantasy series out there that start with a young girl growing up in an abused/repressed situation, she dreams of something bigger, some talent/ability is discovered in her, she gets the appropriate training, and her dreams come true to some extent. The thing I appreciate about this one is that the young girl does not unrealistically blossom as soon as she leaves home. She has scars from her past that take time to overcome. I like that the author d"
1325,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,2,"I was underwhelmed by this book. It wasn't really bad, I just think I read it at the wrong time. If I had read it as a teenager, I'm sure I would have loved it. The story itself is pretty good. I like the world and the characters. But the way Talia's trials were written bothered me. It all felt so staged. Like everything was going so well for Talia, but there needed to be some roadblocks for a good story, so one gets thrown in, but there's a magical gift-wrapped solution just waiting in the wing"
1326,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"I gave this a 3 stars from memory as I read it years ago. I found it to be an easy re read and if this were published today it would probably be classed as YA. It does have something of the YA fantasy novels of today with a bit of vague sexual reference but no actual described acts. It is like a children's book in that the story revolves around a mythical country ruled by a Queen and served by ""Heralds"". The Heralds have magical gifts and a companion which looks like a glowing white horse. Even wit"
1327,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"This is one of my favorite books, and I've read it so many times it's started falling apart. Growing up, I had a hard life, and Talia's story, being carried off by a magical creature away from her horrible family and into a new life, and a grand adventure, struck a chord in me. I completely empathized with her character. At first, Talia starts off as shy, quiet, and does her best to stay in the background, but she gradually grows to be more confident in herself and in her abilities. In the next tw"
1328,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"This was a decent fantasy type book, where a girl who doesn't fit the norm of her people's customs because she likes to read and doesn't want to marry (at the age of 13), escapes and discovers her real talents and her magical purpose in life. The book was easy for me to pick up and read at anytime, the main character was a little too self-deprecating at points, but the main theme of the story, I guess, is the main character learning that she is a valued and valuable person. All in all I liked th"
1329,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"Re-read 2018 I'm picking up some of my favorite books as a re-read to take a break from all the reading for a paper I'm writing. I love the books revolving around Talia and how she became Queens Own of Valdemar. Re-read 2017 Poor Talia, she's a holderkin girl who wants to be something other than a wife or mother. When she escapes into books she dreams of being a Herald of Valdemar and doing great things like Lavan Firestorm and Herald-Mage Vanyel. Unfortunately, that isn't something proper girls d"
1330,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"This isn't a perfect book. Reading it as an adult, I see plenty of flaws; it reads very much as a debut novel. And yet, I don't care one bit. I read it for the first time when I was in fifth grade. I was a weird brunette bookish outsider for a farm town; I wanted to have adventures and do important things and find somewhere to fit in. I have never fallen for a story as hard as I fell for Talia's; I have never identified with a character as much as I did with Talia back in middle school. I don't"
1331,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,2,"OK, this is a wish-fulfillment fantasy beach read. It will not foster your intellectual growth. It will not stretch you as a person. It is about a teenage girl who is treated horribly by her family (because no teenage girl ever feels that way, I'm sure), escapes them, and is promptly discovered to be an IMPORTANT PERSON, and gets pretty much everything she wants including the pony. And the pony can talk. But, you know, we all have had days and even weeks lousy enough that a little adolescent wish"
1332,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"This is one of those books that I wish I'd stumbled on when I was a kid. It's pure, simple fantasy. You can tell that this is early in Mercedes Lackey's career, as the writing quality leaves some things to be desired, but the premise is strong and I'm curious to learn more about the world of Valdemar. Talia is an endearing but somewhat flat character, although it's nice to see a female rags-to-riches lead who isn't a princess. Tropes abound in this book, but it was still a fun look back at the f"
1333,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"This was not my first Mercedes Lackey book, but Talia has been incorporated into later books so I went back and read this series (like I would have left some Lackey books unread!). I get just as caught up in this now as I did when I was a teenager. Love, hate, revenge, death, true love, no giants, but there is magic and talking (sort of) horses. Although the main character is a young girl when this book begin, she never gets the whiny teenage voice some authors like to use, but instead remains i"
1334,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"Just reread this for comfort. My taste for Mercedes Lackey is a funny thing; it was born out of elements from her earlier books... the tormented young protagonists, the horses, the general goodness of her people (except for the ones who are bad - who are then thoroughly bad). But it is not due to her fantastic writing ability - because while Lackey can put together a plot and clearly is prolific, there is nothing noteworthy about her style. I do not admire her turns of phrase. I just wrap their"
1335,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"One of my favourite books of all time and just as good today as it was when I first read it more than twenty years ago. This book takes what could be cliched fantasy elements and weaves them into a perfectly paced plot and characters you desperately care about. The balance between feel-good adventure and grim, occasionally tragic realism is masterful. Anyone who's read the following books will also appreciate the many moments of foreshadowing."
1336,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"Imagine Harry Potter for a slightly older crowd: young adolescents receiving magical training as part of their overall training as Heralds. The Herald system is a good one, designed to ensure that Heralds play fair, despite their power (magical and otherwise). In a world where the powerful often misuse their power, it's heartwarming to see a whole community of people trying and often succeeding to do good."
1337,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"I always forgot, in the haze of delighted nostalgia, how cheesy the writing is in this (and oh jeez, the dialogue. Nobody talks in paragraphs!). Pretty sure I can directly blame this trilogy for my terrible writing throughout all of my teenage years... ...but with that said, Talia was so formative for me that I can't pick this up without immediately being engrossed, fully immersed in her world. This will always be one of my two favorite Valdemar series."
1338,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"I know this book is mildly cheesy and that Talia is the Mary Sue to end all Mary Sues. I know this. But I can't help but adore these books with all my tiny, stone cold heart and soul anyway. Re-read May 2017. Holy typographical errors, Batman! Whoever edited my version of this book was asleep on the job. I found so many errors - spelling errors, continuity errors, typos - it was appalling. And it gave me hope that someday I will be an awesome editor."
1339,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"It's not deathless prose, but it doesn't have to be. I remember what it was like to be a depressed, frustrated, unpopular, book-crazy, horse-crazy teenager, and how this book connected with all those emotions when I settled back to read it one stormy summer afternoon. Every so often, I go back just for old-times' sake, and it's like reuniting with an old lover you've outgrown, but still care about deeply."
1340,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"Reread with Tor.com I wasn't sure how many chapters I was supposed to read for the read-along, and in the end I just kept on going until I was finished. Ooops. It's not a complex or complicated book, but it's still a lovely read and, to be honest, I enjoyed it more than I expected to. Lots of fun."
1341,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"well-written positive story. The author makes the 'fantasy' elements seem quite believable and normal, and the author is able to weave a tale in a way that keeps moving and keeps you rooting for the characters. It's nice to read stories about people I would enjoy spending some time with, reinforcing values of frienship, loyalty, love, trust,hard work that has value. I'll be reading more"
1342,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"A fun read for a fantasy fan. It follows a very classic formula, but has a vibrant world to make it all come to life. Talia is a fun main character and you enjoy cheering her on. I enjoyed this story and will read it again in the future."
1343,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"Initial thoughts review: this book reminded me SO much of Tamora Pierce's stories! I grew up reading them over and over again, so my rating may have more to do with nostalgia than anything else. I can't wait to pass this title along to other Pierce fans."
1344,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"Excellent intro to Valdemar proper, the first in the debut trilogy about the Heralds and their Companions. Fun, light, ""romantic"" fantasy with canon lesbian character (which is nice to see). This was a reread."
1345,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"I'm continuing my Mercedes Lackey #readinghistory with this one, which was my gateway drug to all of her books. I really loved Talia's story, which felt groundbreaking back then. I still have deep affection for this one, though I loved the later books much better."
1346,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"This was among one of my first forays into Fantasy when I was younger. Needless to say it stuck with me, and I pretty much fanboy love all of these books, even though some of the writing isn't the best."
1347,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,2,"Great world building is marred by choppy, and uneven story telling. Talia is not compelling enough of a heroine for me to continue with the series."
1348,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"Probably my very favorite sci-fi/fantasy world in literature. I love them all, and have to re-read all the Haven/Valdemar books every 3-4 years or so."
1349,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"Way too engaging to put down easily and done all too soon because of that. Good thing I have the next two lined up ready to read, because I really want more and don't want to leave this world yet."
1350,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,This book is like going home again.
1351,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"Meh. Too simple a world, depthless characters, and many moments where I rolled my eyes. Will not be continuing the series. Would not recommend you read this unless you're like...10."
1353,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,A very great book. Lovely plot as with all her books. With a charcter who through all her fears and past grievances can still look to the future with light in her eyes.
1354,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"I'm impressed that after 20 years, this book still holds up. It's a great world, interesting characters, and I still want to be a Herald when I grow up."
1355,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,I would probably have loved this book if had read it when I was 14.
1356,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"An excellent read, really enjoyed it."
1357,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,A precocious young girl finds a magical animal friend! What. Don't judge.
1358,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,This is a little gem of a book. Brilliantly written and so easy to get into.
1359,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"I found this book quaint at first. It's a story about a girl who doesn't want to do girl things and wants to go on adventures like the ones she reads in books. She's chosen by fate (in this case, Roland, a horse deity) to go to a magical school that's much more like home than her actual home was and finds out that she was chosen to help the Queen bring harmony to the kingdom. She learns how to be a Herald and helps uncover a plot to overthrow the Queen. So far, so trite, right? But Arrows of the"
1360,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"I'm probably at a 3.5 here. This was a cute and fun fantasy novel and I enjoyed it quite a bit. Talia has just been Chosen to become a Herald - part of the Queen's personal guard. Adjusting to her new life at the Collegium can be tough, but it's full of new friends, new knowledge, and a whole new life. In a lot of ways, this was a pretty typical fantasy novel - a poor, downtrodden kid who doesn't feel like they belong is whisked away to be part of a magic school for special people with special ab"
1361,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"Real rating: 4.5 I've been wanting to read Mercedes Lackey for years, so I'm finally glad to have done it. I really enjoyed this novel -- there were some issues, which I'll get to later, but overall this was great and I'm looking forward to continuing the series. Talia is a child of the Holderkin -- a backwards and bigamous society where she is often abused by her father's wife. On the day she is to be married off, she runs away from home (awesome, you go girl!) and is saved by... a horse. But n"
1362,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,2,"Our YAck book for June, chosen by Laura who wanted to give us something nostalgic and lovely. Unfortunately ARROWS OF THE QUEEN was neither for me. I’ve only been introduced to Lackey’s writing within the last 10 years and so far it’s been 0 for 3 with her books. I’ve read THE FAIRY GODMOTHER and HUNTER, both from newer series, and I DNFed the former and didn’t like the latter. This one wasn’t really much different. I just don’t like her writing style. That’s really what it boils down to: her wri"
1363,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,1,"I started to read this because the trilogy was cheap on Kindle and I haven't tried this author before, though I know she's very prolific. I'll concede that it was probably a mistake because I've just finished Robin Hobbs' entire Elderlings series (all 16 books) and few if any fantasy works can be expected to match that. However, here we go. This is Mercedes Lackey's first book and it really shows. About all you can say is that there are no obvious mistakes in spelling or grammar. Otherwise, I rea"
1364,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"This is very much the beginning of a series. Set within the Collegium, just like Talia, you are there to learn. This is not a bad thing; her classes and instructors are all quite enjoyable. The worldbuilding is fine, wherein we are taught magic, battles, intrigue, and monsters exist, but experience little of it firsthand. More importantly, I feel, is the character development. The book examines child abuse brilliantly through the lens of recovery. I loved that the Collegium allowed Talia an extend"
1365,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,2,"Wasn't my cup of tea, I suppose. I'm sure the series gets more refined in the future works, but I'm unsure I can stomach the number of texts required to get to said point. There were events within that were just so far out of the range of reality, that it took me out of the story. Now you may be thinking 'well, derp, this is a text about a mystical horse and the knights who ride them, I mean, there isn't much of reality you can get from that.' But I say, there has to be something based on truth in"
1366,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"I read The Obsidian Trilogy by Lackey and James Mallory a month or so ago, and enjoyed that series very little; I was wary to pick up another Lackey book. However, her Valdemar books came highly recommended, and I can see why. This book was INFINITELY more enjoyable. The writing style was completely different from what I expected: it was practical, almost simple, but with an irresistible pull that kept the pages turning. I personally appreciated the pace and flow of the book, how it never felt bo"
1367,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,I'm so happy to have finally read about Talia and her first book of adventures! A shy gifted teenager who dreams of becoming a Herald hides from her family one day as they don't understand her and expect her to get married at only 15! A beautiful stallion who mindspeaks his name as Rolan comes into her life one day and changes it forever. Soon Talia is living the life she's only read about in stories and excels at her classes. She finds herself bullied by a group of unknown people who make her li
1368,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"2.5 Finished it but skimmed parts. There are no really developed characters. This book reminds me of a worse-executed The Blue Sword / McKinley books in general, in that it creates a lovely, warm setting but has no urgency and hence agency (for the protagonist.) It's an extended training sequence. Talia is good at everything and everyone loves her (and I'm NOT someone to complain about Mary Sues normally). The only real ""conflict"" is the conspiracy against the queen, which is resolved... around T"
1369,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"Arrows of the Queen is a typical YA high fantasy adventure novel that uses tropes like training schools, communication/bonding with animals, and some measure of courtly intrigue in the vein of Green Rider and Pierce's Tortall series. (the Alanna: The First Adventure , Wild Magic , and First Test quartets come to mind especially) Centering on a young girl named Talia, a misfit living in Mormon-like community, the story truly begins when a strange horse, one of the famous Companions of the Heralds,"
1370,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,2,"I really want to like this book. I really do. The world it creates is breathtaking. The concept of Heralds/Companions is immediately enticing, and the entire culture of the book makes you feel warm and happy inside. However, I could not get over the sloppy writing style. It felt like one long exposition. The time and perspective jumps are jumbled and confusing, the characters are very one-dimensional, and the conflicts are too hastily resolved. In fact, the main character, for all her importance"
1371,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,1,"I read this book along time ago and was so thoroughly unimpressed that it stuck with me for over a decade. The plot was anemic, the characters unmemorable and flat, the stakes low, and the conflict flat. *Spoilers* There is almost nothing that I remember about the plot or story, except for the part where Lackey sets up a romance, has the characters utterly fail three or four times to have sex, then has them sorta shrug it off and decide then and there that are just friends. On the one hand, no one"
1372,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"While reading this book I couldn't believe the parallels between it and Harry Potter--even though it was published long before HP. Both revolve around a child who is poorly cared for, then they are eventually introduced to a new world in which they are a ""star"" in some way, they develop deep friendships in this new world, and they face challenges never imagined. Loved the coincidences and appreciated the fact that it was a story revolving around a girl this time, instead of a boy. I also loved h"
1373,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"This was the first book I've read by this author, and based on the rating & amount of reviewers, I expected something fantastic. Instead, I found this to be on a children's level, and I wasn't expecting that. The plot was so basic. And anytime anything nice and complicated could've developed, the problems just resolved themselves with practically no effort on the characters' parts. I enjoy children's books. I love most of Tamora Pierce's works. But I found this to be so much simpler. It had al"
1374,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"So I'm being slightly generous in my rating here -- it definitely had a few debut novel problems in that information was sometimes oddly given in omniscient breaks from the main narrative (something that persists even in later Lackey novels though she does it much more smoothly so you hardly notice), there were jarring jumps in time that made the book feel episodic with the reader skipping half a season, and the plot and worldbuilding were pretty spasmodic. This has the definite feel of a ""YA no"
1375,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"Reread for nostalgia I guess. Surprised at well it holds up. I'm mean it's basically teenage wish fulfillment (abused girl turns out to be special and gets special magical horse too!), and it's kind of more episodic than an actual plot, but it is essentially a bildungsroman and mostly just a lot of world building, but it's a head a shoulders above the usual YA fantasy of girls discovering they are special. It's not without problems. Most the conflict is quickly and easily resolved, there's huge"
1376,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"Wow, did I ever enjoy this. I have read books of Mercedes Lackey before but it was years ago and I decided it was about time I started from the beginning. Yes there is the odd typo in the book but I am totally willing to overlook that. This is the story of how Talia becomes a Herald. After running away from her repressive family who would send the 13 year old off to be married, she sees a Companion who convinces her to get on his back. As she knows nothing about how Companions choose she isn't su"
1377,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"Talia lives in a dream world of Heralds and Companions, eagerly searching out any of the old stories she can get her hands on. Her real world, however, is far bleaker - as Holderkin, her role as a woman is to marry and bear younglings. On her 13th birthday, she is told that she must Marry. Destroyed by shock and fear, Talia runs to her secret hiding place, in tears, knowing that all her dreams will end. Until she comes upon a beautiful white horse and realizes that she must return him to his rig"
1378,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"That was cute. Sweet easy read, in the style I love with the themes that grab me. Maybe a bit too glib and easy for our heroine, all hardships felt like they were dispersed easily and in terms of emotional depth while written well I didn't connect as much because the characters still seemed to lack the necessary amount of..well..character. Also most likely because I would have LOVED this properly were I the target age, as it has the same feel as Tamora Pierces early books.. But I think what made"
1379,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"So, once upon a time when I was scarcely 13 I picked up this book. And there was a 13 year old girl for a main character who wasn’t pretty and liked animals and reading with a conservative family that just didn’t understand her. And I learned the meaning of ~target audience~ :-) As a middle aged adult I know Lackey’s books aren’t great classics of literature but there’s something to be said sometimes for a book where the brave and true will in the end triumph over evil and make things just a litt"
1380,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"3.5 to 4 stars. Liked it, it was cute. Will probably pick up the sequels at some point. Main character is quite Mary Sue-ish (everyone insta likes her, she has a talent for a lot of things, helps everyone out, but yet stays humble of course), but I guess the plot explains/accounts for that (seeing as that would be the nature of a ""Chosen""), so I'll let it slide ;). I did think the narrative was a little ""skippish"" at times, as in would suddenly skip to a different (character) perspective, skip so"
1381,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"There are a lot of reviews that say this could have been three books, and I don't disagree, per se, but I certainly appreciate it for what it is. If I'd read this as a 12 year old I probably would've re-read it every month. There are also a lot of reviews that say everything feels normal and acceptable except for the horse bond, which makes me wonder if those readers have ever met a horse. If the rest of the magic is at a level that makes sense for you, the tbh horse magic is at a lower level of"
1382,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"4.5 Stars - This older fantasy was on my to-read list until I came across the trilogy in a used bookstore during my Victoria vacation. It was interesting enough that I flew through the book captivated. Talia is a different type of character than I am used to reading about, especially with the Holderkin aka 'communal/colony' type of upbringing with abuse that bothered me a bit. Some viewpoints I didnt agree with and the whole common-talk of sex by thirteen year olds was unusual but I loved the id"
1383,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"This book was the 4th of Lackey's Valdemar books I purchased, as soon as I could after finishing The Last Herald-Mage trilogy. I found Arrows of the Queen not to be quite as compelling as Vanyel's story, yet I quite enjoyed it. Talia is a strong character whose quirks and personality drew me in. Though some readers may find the concept of Heralds and Companions a little saccharine, they are not without their challenges and difficulties. These are good people overall, but they do have flaws. One"
1384,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"What girl hasn't wanted to be rescued from some more-or-less desperate state and carried away on the back of a white horse? For many of us, it's the knight on the white horse who's the hero. For Talia, the heroine of this book, it's the horse alone. Mercedes Lackey dispenses with the knight, as why shouldn't she? We don't all need, or even want, the knight-hero, we just need the vehicle. And a horse, of whatever color, is close to the heart and dreams of many a girl (no matter what her age, even"
1385,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,2,"DNF @ 86% I had really high expectations of this one. Just think: If I liked it, I'd suddenly have access to twenty or more books in an awesome universe. Unfortunately, I couldn't even get through the book. When I pick up a book, I want to read a story. This wasn't a story. It was a whole introductory book, and as such, it was boring. We were regaled with the history of the world, but not in a seamless way. It felt more like a lecture. When we weren't stuck in class, the whole of the actual story"
1386,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"This is a classic 1980's fantasy trilogy featuring kingdom guardians called Heralds and their magical horses. Thirteen year old Talia escapes her family's ultra-patriarchal society and their plans for her marriage by becoming chosen by one of the magical horses called Companions to start training to become a Herald. Most of the book is Talia at the Herald school as she deals with bullies, finding friends, and growing up. There is not a ton of action or fighting here. The focus is more on the gro"
1387,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"So, I've never read any of Mercedes Lackey's fiction in my adolescence. This is a pity, probably, because this book is exactly tailored to the adolescent fantasy reader. I'm going to be rather critical in this review so I want to preface this by making it clear that despite its many flaws, Arrows of the Queen was quite readable and I was interested in what would come next despite its lack of much character development or a terribly involved plot. This is something of a feat, and I credit it as m"
1388,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"Mercedes Lackey's first novel and my first experience with her work (unless I've read a short story by her in the past and forgot about it), and it's a rather rough effort. Lackey created an extremely appealing setting and some likable characters, but there's very little plot here; Arrows of the Queen is more of an introduction for the setting and showing us Talia's journey to becoming a Harald than anything else. Every obstacle is temporary at worst; even conspiracies against the throne, and we"
1389,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"3,5 stars. One of the fundamental works of Romantic Fantasy, this book is an amazingly easy read. Talia is a joyous character, and the character and relationship build is fantastic. This is what this type of fantasy is about: characters creating bonds, discovering themselves. For a book written in 1987, it was very progressive, and I don't doubt it is a heavy influence of modern YA.

1390,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"I seem to be reading a lot of books that don't feel like they have a central conflict but are still unified in plot. Arrows of the Queen is better understood as a series of vignettes documenting the growth of Talia into her powers and role as The Queen's Own. It has a number of charming moments, and while there are few moments where failure seems a threat, it maintained my interest. There's a lot of heavy handed foreshadowing, so there are few surprises about anything, but the characters are char"
1391,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"I am excited to continue this series. It was well written, in my opinion, with a really interesting world that I am excited to explore further and fun characters who I can't wait to learn more about. Talia, the lead, seems like a character I can relate with and I look forward to see her adventure continue. Also side note: This feels like something Tamora Pierce might have used as an inspiration for Alanna's world if that makes any sense... I want to know if there is any proof of this... does anyo"
1392,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"Maybe I've been reading too much GRRM but I found this book to be oddly lacking in world and character building. It also felt a little cringe wish fulfillment for little girls with the best friends for life horse companions. Saying all that, it was readable, and perhaps I'm no longer the target audience for this series. I probably would've enjoyed it a lot when I was 14 and maybe even 24. I guess I was left a little puzzled because I'd always known Mercedes Lackey's name as a respected epic fanta"
1393,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,Talia is a child in a Holderkin family and is considered to be a trouble maker. When she turns 13 her father's wives tell her it is time for her to be married. Talia doesn't want to be married so she runs off to her favourite hiding place. When she hears a horse on the road below her she leans out to look and falls down a bank to land at the feet of the animal. Then she realized it is a Companion but he has no Herald so Talia decides to return him to his Herald and thus starts a journey that ult
1394,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,2,"Although this book is around 300 pages, it goes by quickly as the plot moves along smoothly. There’s not too much excitement or action, but it ties in nicely to previous and future novels. The two most prominent issues have to do with the writing. Character perspectives are not clear as they switch often and without a break in the text. Also, near the end there are many grammatical issues. Overall, it is a casual read if you are interested in some background of Valdemar, but might not make you w"
1395,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"I would categorize this as YA Fantasy. Young Talia leaves her home where she is underappreciated and about to embark on a life of servitude. She meets Rolan- a magical horse - with whom she forms an immediate connection. Rolan takes her to the Collegium where she will learn how to become a Herald- a protector of the Queen. In addition, she is to take charge of Elspeth, the Queen's spoiled daughter. Talia discovers she has innate gifts as she makes friends and some enemies. I enjoyed the book for"
1396,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"Really, really good book. I read almost 60% one day and finished it in the next couple. Lackey's writing is very easy to read, and her concepts are worded in a way that makes them clear to understand. I was a little bummed about Talia and Skif for awhile, but the end made up for that. Really, the only ""complaint"" I have is that it is sometimes hard to follow the flow of time. Lackey mentions the leaves changing and the seasons, but it still becomes muddled in terms of weeks/months/years. I will"
1397,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"The pairing of teens and Companions (magical horses) would make this a strong read-alike for the Dragonriders of Pern series by Anne McCaffrey. The strong feminist tones recall Marion Zimmer Bradley, to whom this book is dedicated. (The tones also harken to Anne McCaffrey.) Additionally, the young, unwanted child going to a school for magic to find themselves and destiny ties into the Harry Potter series by J. K. Rowling, but with a strong female twist."
1398,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"This is one of my favorite books from when I was younger. So rereading it at as an adult makes it even more special, there are so many nuances that I didn't see when I was younger. This book, has magic, fantasy and an incredible world that is richly developed. The main character in this book, is a young girl named Talia. It follows her story as she finds herself swept up into mystery, myth and new family."
1399,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"The beginning of a wonderful tale. Arrows of the Queen marks the start (but not chronologically) of Lackey's tales of Valdemar. And what a great start it is. Fantasy world building shown through the eyes of a character that believes the world itself is a fairy tale. Queen is charming while placing plot points and hints enough to sustain another 20 books. Valdemar is one of my favorite series, and Arrows my favorite trilogy within it."
1400,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"Reminded me somewhat of Tamora Pierce books, but with less conflict. I would say the one big drawback to the book was lack of conflict- there were things that happened and a sinister plot against the kingdom, but we were removed from it in perspective. The novel is obviously meant for a younger reader than myself (it has magic horses who are important characters, and the leads great struggle is accepting her own self worth), but it made a pleasant read while doing my laundry."
1401,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"Little did I know this was exactly the book I needed to read. It is the story of a 13-year old girl suddenly whisked away from everything she's known and put into the world she wanted to be in. It could be considered a princess-tale with more realism...if you want to see it that way. Lackey is an author I have enjoyed. As the first published work of hers, I must say I thoroughly enjoyed it. Having read the first novel of some more modern popular writers, I have to say, it's too bad that they were"
1402,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"Excellent book for all ages, but especially good for pre-teens & teens dealing with feeling isolated, the lead character in this book will be very relatable. I have always enjoyed Mercedes Lackey's writing, especially the Heralds of Valdemar series, and the nice thing is the Talia trilogy you do not need to actually read the previous books in the main part of the series to be able to follow Talia's story. Though I definitely recommend ALL of the books in the full series, if you can!"
1403,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"Having finished the Adept series, have decided to re-read from my owned books Mercedes Lackey's Valdemar series (which should take a good bit a time). Liked this story quite a bit, pretty much that of the classic misfit who does not fit in her place and is whisked away to where she not only fits in but is very much needed. Thought it was a little short on action, with a lot of the story working on setting up Lackey's world. But it was a quick absorbing read nonetheless."
1404,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"I love all the Mercedes Lackey books. I got the audiobook version via Hoopla, listened to most of it last night, and the rest today. Given a choice of fictional places to actually live in, Valdemar would top my list. I like the amount of detail given to the infrastructure, and the characters live on in my imagination. In some ways these stories remind me of Pern and of Darkover, which is not in the least surprising."
1405,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"I don't know why I've waited so long to read Mercedes Lackey! (probably because I knew she had a bazillion books and that I would get suckered into reading them all...) This story took me back to my younger days of reading Tamora Pierce and other strong-lady-character fantasies, and genuinely enjoying fantasy. I've been getting bored of the genre lately, but I think my love is about to get rekindled as I devour the rest of this series!"
1406,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"Really solid book. Lots of tropes, but the main character is really well developed. I enjoyed the world building and the plot. The friendship with the mentor figure was well done and emotionally satisfying. The love interest plot point was strangely developed and probably the only thing I didn’t enjoy about the story."
1407,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"It was nice to read this book again. Returning to Valdemar is always fun, and I like it when the problems the heroes face are bullies and bandits rather than world-ending cataclysms. It's always nice to read about Talia and friends, and I especially likes reading about her friendship and not-relationship with Skif."
1408,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"This had everything I love in a book, great characters, action, change, magic, a great main character, and wonderful supporting characters. I read this book in one sitting, and now can’t wait to get the next book!! My favorite books are the Alanna the Lioness books by Tamora Pierce, and I found a lot of the same elements in this book."
1409,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,This was a book I read as a child. I was bullied and spent most of my time reading. Even though I am male it presented such an amazing perspective. The perspective it provided helped reduce the impact of my trauma. I now work to help people professionally. I continue to recommend this novel/series as a way of explaining how to protect yourself from powerful emotions.
1410,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,I read the three book series I liked up until the end. I wanted more and all the other books that are a compliment to this series don't give you an update on the people in this particular series. I think the writer made a mistake in not giving a bigger picture after the last book in the Heralds of Valdemar series.
1411,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"The first part of a trilogy (The Heralds of Valdemar) and my first Mercedes Lackey novel and I'm impressed. The story of a young girl being Chosen to be a Herald, how she develops and grows into the role, is engaging, fun and written in an uncomplicated style that makes reading it a pleasure., Well worth looking at if you enjoy fantasy novels."
1412,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"I loved this book so much! The characters, the world, the GiftS, the Companions, the feminism! It's a breath of fresh air and I can't believe it's taken me so long to read these! I've read the Black Griffon trilogy and some other of her books but never these. I especially love how she described the most mundane details of daily tasks and how loving and real her characters seem."
1413,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"Obviously the first of a trilogy, as the book spends a fair amount of time establishing setting and character, which is fine. Fairly light in tone, but with hints of darkness to come. Talia is a little Mary Sue-ish at times. Still, an enjoyable YA fantasy with an interesting setting and likable characters."
1414,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"This was really great and held up to my memory of the book. I read it when in was younger and wasn't sure it'd still be good. I love Talia as a character and think all the characters develop well. I wish there was a more nuanced character and plot development , but honestly, it's a good story and totally worth the read."
1415,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"A young girl from a sheltered and repressively religious background, who has her head in the clouds and a passionate desire to become a Herald of Valdemar 'finds' a lone Companion and takes a wild ride away from her family and all she knew to become a trainee. This story is wonderfully written and proves that family is not just blood, its the people who love you."
1416,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"I used to LOVE this series. I needed a quick, light read so I picked up this one again. I can understand why I liked it before, but it seems dated and underwritten. Part of me wants to read the next two to see if my old liking comes through and part of me wants to cut my losses and tackle the rest of my to-be-read shelf."
1417,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"Expectations really are key to reading experience! This was one of my least favorite Valdemar trilogies when I was younger, so my hopes were low when I picked this up for a reread, but most of the stuff I remember hating apparently happens in the later books -- this one is really not that bad. A solid old-school ""young girl goes off to magic school"" fantasy novel."
1418,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"This was a great book, if you read the series you will understand the plot. But if you jump right into the end of a twenty plus book series there are many things you won't understand. I personally read many of the books from Black Griffin to the Owls trilogy and loved all of them."
1419,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,This was ok. A story about making friends and finding out where you belong. The magic and mystery in the story is off screen. It is talked about and solved by others. I would have found this more interesting if this story was written in 3rd person omniscient.
1420,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,I can't believe I haven't read this one yet. This is a story about a girl being chosen by a magical creature and ending up at a special school. There are so many books like this. Song of the Lioness sprung to mind immediately. I really liked it and want the next one. Right now.
1421,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"Really sweet and awesome fantasy, loved the characterization and developement n stuffs. wow i actually finished a book. most of the time i just return say 7 books to the library, 3 overdue, four unread, two read, one half finished."
1422,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,2,"The plot arc and the setting are more like British boarding school than fantasy. Also, everybody keeps using the word ""awfully"" a lot (but Mercedes Lackey is American, I checked - it's strange). It also doesn't help that Talia is the saccharine archetype of feminine virtue."
1423,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,2,"It was... fine. I feel like I would have liked this much more ~10 years ago, but at this point it was slightly too old-school for me. I got my fill of this type of story with various other YA herione novels when I was actually a teenager."
1424,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"A bit of magic and folklore...about a young girl who finds out she is chosen to be a prestigious herald and work for the queen of this fictional land. Liked it a lot, but the second half of the book seemed to skim too much."
1425,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"This was a very enjoyable read. Talia's a strong character, even though I wished she could have found faith in herself and others a bit sooner, but it'll be interesting to follow her story in the next two books."
1426,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"This was so much fun, and while I think it exhibits some of what are now considered ""tropes"" (like the chosen one protagonist) I think it pulls them off quite well and was still a great read! A series with so many books in it, though, why do I keep doing this to myself..."
1427,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"Re-Read .. Awesome book, awesome series, awesome world, from an awesome author.. Haven't read any of the Valdemar books in a long time now, so I figured it was time to start it all from scratch again.. :)"
1428,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"I really enjoyed this book. I'm a little (very) disappointed that I didn't find this series as a teenager. There are times where I had to remind myself to suspend my disbelief, but it was still a very fun read. It reminds me a lot of the Lioness series by Tamora Pierce."
1430,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,2,"A fantasy where an oppressed 13 year old girl escapes and is selected as a herald working with a magic horse. My wife says she read lots of books in this series, and I see how a young girl would love it. I made it to the time her Herald school has bullies bullying her."
1431,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,2,"Sad. Shouldn't have revisited this as an adult. Loose storytelling, massive plot holes. Loved it as a teen though."
1432,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,1,did not finish. I hated the writing style and the main character.
1433,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,A well written book. Enjoyed reading it.
1434,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,I loved this series while I was in Middle School...reread it several times back then.

1436,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,A well written book. Enjoyed reading it.
1437,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,1,at least the cover is pink and purple

1440,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,A well written book. Enjoyed reading it.
1441,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,Oh I do love Mercedes Lackey's books. Valdemar is a wonderful world that she's built and I'm enjoying reading all my childhood favorites again.
1442,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"My gateway to the world of fantasy as a teen, with magic horses, I was instantly enthralled. I love this series and own most of it."
1443,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,Captivating.
1444,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,A well written book. Enjoyed reading it.
1445,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,This was great. I most especially loved the growth of the main character. There are lots of great characters in this book.
1446,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,A well written book. Enjoyed reading it.
1447,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"I enjoyed it for the most part and had trouble putting it down. However, what happened with the queer couple annoyed me quite a bit and brought my rating down."
1448,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,I had fun with this. Now on to book 2.
1449,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,A well written book. Enjoyed reading it.
1450,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,A well written book. Enjoyed reading it.

1454,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,A well written book. Enjoyed reading it.
1455,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,I liked this one. It’s an interesting world and I really like the characters. It’s a nice ride.
1456,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,This was super fun. Mercedes Lackey is my go to fun reading. A welcome break from graduate school.
1457,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,5,"I haven't reviewed this because I read it so long ago that all I can remember is I loved it. I'll take our very old and battered copy (bought in 1987) to the hospice this weekend when I go with Celyn and see if I can't refresh my memory. RIP, Sir Terry. 'DON'T THINK OF IT AS DYING,' said Death, 'JUST THINK OF IT AS LEAVING EARLY TO AVOID THE RUSH.' So - to the review! I've just read this in slightly over 24 hours ... which is extraordinary for me. I normally take a month to read a book. It is, to be"
1458,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,"Reading The Color of Magic is akin to eating an entire bowl of ice cream just a little too fast...sure, it may cause your head to hurt at times, but the sweet rewards make it all worth it! Filled with ambitious wizards and ruthless assassins, the city of Ankh-Morpork has survived many dangers in the past, but now it faces an even more destructive force... TOURISM !!! When a rich but bored outsider named Twoflower decides to explore the city in search for adventure, it soon becomes an adventure for"
1459,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,"Before picking it up, I'd heard that The Colour of Magic was funny. Now that can mean just about anything because, let's face it, comedy is the most subjective of arts. Funny is a deeply personal thing. The ""funny peculiar"" and the ""funny ha-ha"" might not be the same from person to person or even to the same person depending on their mood or their place in life. So knowing something is funny ahead of reading it really doesn't tell me much. I'd read Terry Pratchett 's & Neil Gaiman 's Good Omen"
1460,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,I will officially be reading the entire Discworld series!
1461,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,"And so it begins … Sir Terry Pratchett’s wildly imaginative Discworld series begins with the 1983 publication of The Color of Magic. I have been reading science fiction and fantasy for a long time and somehow I managed to not read any of his works until I came in late to the party. A friend suggested I try one, I’d like it and so I read the fourth in the series, Mort and I thought so much that I decided I would climb the hill and enjoy every step. Begin with a heaping portion of British humor (hum"
1462,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,2,"This must be the exception that proves the rule. For years I’ve been adamantly advocating reading series in publication order, whether a coherent story or a set of standalones. In Discworld , that simply doesn’t seem to be the best solution. Everyone seems to suggest that a new reader should not start with the first book, so this must be partially my fault for doing it anyway. The Colour of Magic is at best a mediocre introduction to what is supposedly the best humourous fantasy series ever writte"
1463,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,5,"I'm pretty sure people have told me about Pratchett and his Diskworld series before, usually working in the phrase ""He's the Douglas Adams of fantasy"" into the description. But the problem was that I always felt that I had had enough of Adams after the third Hithiker's Guide to the Galaxy book, and whenever I scanned Pratchett's section in the bookstore I was immediately put off by not knowing where to start reading among the approximately five hundred thousand Diskworld books. I'm glad I finall"
1464,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,"If I hadn't already read the entire series, and if I was judging this book just by its own merits, I'd still be saying that it harnesses the lightning and even finds a way to make it go side to side rather than up and down. It's really fantastic as a straight fantasy with tons of humorous elements, with a good deal more worldbuilding than all the later books, more obvious and harsher tongue-in-cheek elements, and a great setup for the Great Wizzard Rincewind. Honestly? I love Rincewind. I love the"
1465,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,1,"This series is much beloved of my friends, both here on Goodreads and out in the wilds of meatspace --he's even been referred to as Fantasy's answer to one of my favorite authors: the superlatively funny and insightful Douglas Adams . As such, I was excited to start the series at the beginning, hoping the wit and wisdom would overcome the warts of this early outing. Unfortunately,the jokes drew more groans than guffaws, reminding me of Mark Twain's comments on the book of friend and fellow America"
1466,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,5,"Terry Pratchett is a genius, as usual. This man can do no wrong. He reminds me a lot of Douglas Adams, my favorite in the realm of satire. Look at this similarity: ""In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."" - Douglas Adams, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe ""Disc philosophers agree that the First Men, shortly after their creation, understandably lost their temper."" - Terry Pratchett, The Color of Magic The Co"

1468,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,"“It is at this point that normal language gives up, and goes and has a drink.” I never really planned to read this until I met someone who loves the Discworld novels so much that I could no longer put them off. Also, this series has so many books that I will probably never be able to finish it, which kept me from reading it in the first place. Apart from the fact that they always seemed a bit too ridiculous to actually be good. Now, I did catch myself laughing a few times and generally enjoying it"
1469,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,"A charming and sometimes tedious novel, Rincewind grew on me quickly and I enjoyed watching him get into and out of scrapes along the way. Death's and Fate's frustration with him was hilarious. I kept imagining them as toddlers stomping their feet :-D. Two Flower I was so so on... sometimes he charmed me and others... eh.

1470,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,2,"It had some funny moments, but I really struggled to get through it. In all fairness to the people who suggested I read the Discworld series, this is not one of the ones they said I should start with. I think I mostly had a hard time slogging through all of the world-building and made up words. Fantasy has never been my thing, because I'm not someone who enjoys reading descriptions of the characters surroundings. I'm not giving up on the series, though. I think I'll just go back through my book"

Unfortunately, this book has been recommended to me so many times by well-meaning friends who know my love of absurd British humor that it couldn't possibly live up to the hype. It suffers from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy syndrome.

Their response was always the same, ""Oh, but you h"
1475,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,"The very first Discworld novel. The one it all began with. I've been a fan of Sir Terry's for a long time. I've even read a few other of his books (some standalone, some of the Fairy Tales or later volumes of this series) and loved them all. Fans have given me two pieces of advice ever since I first heard of Discworld : 1) Stay away from the first 3 books! 2) Read them all! What are you, a savage?! *lol* You can see how this made me undecided for the longest time. Thus, I did what every self-respected"
1476,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,5,I first read this book many years ago and I remember I fell in love with the Disc World as soon as I read the first few pages. I loved the idea of the turtle swimming through space and the elephants and the rim fall and the eighth colour in the spectrum called octarine. Twoflower and Rincewind were the first of many of Pratchett's characters I would meet who are so helpless and yet who blunder successfully through mishap after mishap. And as for the Luggage! That has to be one of the best invent

Well, look no further - The Color of Magic is your ticket! Of all the Discworld books, of all the craziness, the thousands of jokes, the laser-guided satire of fantasy novels so good that it became almost its own genre, for me the Color of Magic is the one book to rule them all. Maybe it’s because thi"
1483,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,"Zany, wild, preposterous, and oh so fun—I understand the Discworld hype and see why it's such a fan favourite. But underneath all the light humour is clever trope subversion and a sense that Pratchett knows exactly what he's doing, more so than just a few laughs. This first installment isn't an immediate favourite, but it's a promising start to a series I'm looking forward to reading. I know there are a ton of Discworld reading guides out there, but I'm a stickler for published order and I'm going"
1484,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,5,"This was the perfect pick me up after the depressing, depressing, depressing downer if The Road by Cormac McCarthy. I laughed out loud reading this and that is not something I do very often. Rincewind is a new favorite character and Terry Pratchett is a new favorite author. I'm not sure I would have loved this as much I I hadn't been in the perfect mood for it. But, I was in the perfect mood and I did love it."
1485,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,"The first time I read this book, I thought it was okay. Not the best Discworld, but okay. But each time I re-read it, I like it more. I mean, there is the Pern parody that is great. There is the kick ass daughter who inherits. There are the riffs on heroes. And yet, there is the fact that we are all Rincewind. I know, I know, I'm an American, so I should be Twoflower. But Rincewind is what we would all be if we were in LOTR. Old Review # 2 The thing about this isn't the brilliant with and humor. It i"
1488,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,"Ahh, the story of Twoflower and the ""failed"" wizard Rincewind. Although calling Rincewind a ""failed"" wizard is possibly not really fair to him as he's only a ""failed"" wizard because having sneaked a look at a forbidden spell book one the 8 Great Spells has taken up the room in his brain that would be needed for other spells and he can't get it out, at least not without casting it, and since neither he nor the other wizards know what it will do...destroy the world, the universe, the multiverse..."

Under pressure to read and return, I zipped through this book and its immediate sequel The Light Fantastic unimpressed and declined to read additional entries in the series. I recently took the opportunity to re-read The Color of Magic for a group discussion in a GR book club, and I enjoyed it much more this time through.

1491,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,"This was a fun, quick read. I enjoyed it and plan to read my way through disc world. This somewhat cartoonish seeming universe is populated by colorful and unlikely characters. The author created an original and interesting mythology and multiverse. Hidden within the tongue and cheek humor and somewhat silly action is an intelligence and insightful view of not just those make believe world, but ours as well. Many references are to actual occult concepts and the magic, while loose, humorous and e"

1495,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,"Originally rated 5 stars when I joined Goodreads although I actually read it about twenty years ago and rated it from memory. So...20-ish years on I got nostalgic about Terry Pratchett and decided to re-read them. And here I am, already losing steam. It was fantastic to visit Rincewind, Twoflower, the sapient pearwood Luggage, Ankh Morpork and of course DEATH. I chuckled and laughed in many places. And yet, either it wasn't as good as I remembered OR- I've changed! Will I re read any of the others?"
1497,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,"This was quite the interesting and funny little book. So much is happening in these 200 odd pages. So many characters. My mind has been entertained as well as confused. I enjoyed Rincwind and Twoflower. Death is also great. Discworld, is going to be a fun journey."
1498,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,"Full review to come. A nice light read. Not as whimsical as I thought it would be, but still a good amount of whimsy. Plus it is nice to read a fantasy book without the fate of the world at stake."

So, so well. *Insert disappointed sigh* I'm probably living under a rock but I didn't actually know that Discworld books (or at least this book) were a satire of Fantasy. To fully enjoy this you need to have at least some knowledge of the things he's making fun of: the hero, the stupid overblown plots, the ex-machina situations... It makes it even better if you have read the book he's referencing (*cough* The Dragonriders of Pern *cough*) and hated the very same things he's po"

A good friend of mine loves the series and recommended it to me over 10 years ago, but I just never got around to it. He suggested I might be better off starting with Guards! Guards! than this book.

But unfortunately there are few examples if half funny stuff. The humor is very British and quite hit and miss. I'm thankful though, that the tone is kept light and there's no dark humor in this book. This is the one book that made me discouraged in pursuing the series, but given that few books are very good, i might give it another go because I'm quite curious a"
1506,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,"With a more conclusive ending and a slightly less episodic/random plot, I’d probably bump this classic satirical fantasy novel up to four stars, but as it is I enjoyed reading The Colour of Magic . The Douglas Adams comparisons are obvious – and apt, I think. Both authors bring a very dry, British wit to a well-worn genre, tweaking the conventions in a way that is both amusing (though rarely laugh-out-loud hilarious) and affectionate. In this case, the characters of the Luggage and Death are terri"
1507,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,"I enjoy reading science fiction and fantasy, but my mother always says that she does not. She claims that in this sort of book, the author can allow the characters to do ""anything"", and there are no set rules for the natural world to obey. I generally disagree with her. Good science fiction and fantasy authors invent a world, and they invent the parameters of the possible, and stick within those limits. However, in this book, I must say, anything goes. There are no limits to the magic; it is boun"

And also to not give up the series if the first book didn't work. But I'm stubborn and here I am. I also like to see authors evolving in the craft and chronological order also helps with that. But I now do know where their warnings come from. I loved the description of the world (in the case of the turtle and space, as countries were a bit lacking) and this had some great one liners and quot"

Ordinarily I'm not a fan of audiobooks but it seemed like the perfect way and the perfect time to get started on the great Discworld re-read that I've had planned for the past two years. It worked.

Then I decided to give them a proper go and start reading from book 1, suddenly things clicked and I was converted. The characters are brilliant, the story is mad and moves along at one hell of a pace. The luggage is my hero! Pratchett has his own unique writing style and if you can get into it then you're in for a great reading experience...."

1515,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,"Author Terry Pratchett may be the modern day Mark Twain, one of the most prolific satirical authors in genre fiction. The world he spins his elaborate metaphors is that of Discworld, a setting in which he has successfully parodied everything from opera to religion, from currency to war, from morris dancing to mall proliferation. But before Discworld was a template upon which all things modern could be parodied, it was simply a parody, and a mediocre one at best. Pratchett's humor is similar in ma"
1516,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,"I had a number of preconceived notions about the Discworld novels, which is probably why I took so long before I attempted one. Fortunately, my preconceptions were mostly innacurate. What I will say about Terry Pratchett's writing, and the humour in particular: it can be pretty random . There were times when I went ""huh?"", or, ""erm?"", or just sighed in perplexity. He is also not afraid of applying deus ex machina to his sequences climaxes. That being said, these books are a blast to read, and the"

Either way, it made for quite an entertaining notion of the universe. The mighty wizard Rincewind, he's really only mighty because he has an unknown diabolical spell burie"
1519,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,2,"Meh. I just can't think of much more to say about it. I only read it because it briefly mentions the Discworld librarian, but that brief mention was one mention and no description, not worth it. Loved the Tiffany Aching subset, so there might be other Discworld books I'd enjoy, but this wasn't one."

1522,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,"This book is so utterly unique that it's borderline genius... but in a wonky way. I'm almost embarrassed to admit that it's taken my entire 33 years of life to actually get started on reading the late legendary Terry Pratchett. When I agreed to jump into a Discworld review a month group, I was secretly excited to have an excuse to read such a HUGE series. I think that's why I've always put it off, because honestly who has the time for the kind of commitment? Being the 'blame it on someone else'"
1524,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,"Having recently read Swords of Lankhmar , I was able to recognize a marked influence of Leiber on this opening volume of Pratchett's popular Discworld series. Like Nehwon, the Discworld is a swords-and-sorcery flavored fantasy realm where the social environment is generally not a benevolent one; Pratchett's corrupt and decadent city of Ankh-Morpork has certain similarities to Lankhmar, and Bravd and the Weasel here are very reminiscent of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser. Potentates on the Discworld ev"
1525,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,"I was expecting to barely get through this - I read it twenty years ago, started me on Discworld, but my opinion of it has gone downhill ever since. It's just a cheap parody, after all. It turns out that, parody aside (which itself is an interesting aspect, as the thing parodied, Sword and Sorcery, is itself now dead and buried), this is a thrillingly creative book. The imagination, the wit, and the erudition of Pratchett shine forth on every page; indeed, there is far more of his chaotic genius"

That’s what happens to my brain all the time! Seriously though, if you like humorous fantasy there is no escaping Terry Pratchett, and the colour of magic is probably one of the staples in the genre. And for good reason! It's got word plays: the most memorable might be Twoflower working with inn-sewer-ants , although I"

Okay, everything is brilliant. :) If the rest get better, then I'm in for a treat.

But still, it was a fun adventure so I`m really Looking foreword to read other Discworld novels. Especially the from the Death sub-series ;)"

1534,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,"[FROM THE PREFACE:] The Discworld is not a coherent fantasy world. Its geography is fuzzy, its chronology unreliable. A small traveling circle of firelight in a chilly infinity has turned out to be the home of defiant jokes and last chances. There are no maps. You can't map a sense of humor. Anyway, what is a fantasy map but a space beyond which There Be Dragons? On the Discworld we know that There Be Dragons Everywhere. They might not all have scales and forked tongues, but they Be Here all right"

1539,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,2.5 stars This was very disappointing (please don’t hate me) – I’ve read a few Terry Pratchett books in the past and enjoyed them and have heard great things about the Rincewind books so I suppose I had quite high expectations. The Colour of Magic follows Rincewind – a failed wizard – and Twoflower – the first ever tourist to the discworld – as they go on various adventures and get themselves in and out of trouble. I liked all the little tidbits about the discworld and I feel like the world is ver
1540,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,5,"The Color of Magic is in fact four novella-length stories stitched together to create a novel-length book. But don't worry, the book reads well as a whole without a jerking bump in sight. I wouldn't have even noticed the stitching if I haven't known it was there. As the story starts, Rincewind a disgraced wizard meets up with Twoflower an oblivious tourist and his rather menacing walking luggage (yes, with a luggage like Twoflower's you don't have to worry about carry your things around; the seve"
1541,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,"“Twoflower was a tourist, the first ever seen on the discworld. Tourist, Rincewind had decided, meant 'idiot'.” Well, Mr. Pratchett, that was a hell of an adventure. I've always read some magnificent reviews of Pratchett's books written by my GR friends. Right from the beginning, I've added his books to my TBR shelf. Now that I've read the first one of Discworld series, I can say I'm not disappointed. “Rincewind tried to force the memory out of his mind, but it was rather enjoying itself there,"
1542,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,"As an avid Discworld fan, I would like to warn every new reader of Discworld: do not start Discworld with the Color of Magic! This is the worst book in the series, and by a large margin. Start with Mort or Men at Arms . You can come back to this when you gained appreciation for Pratchett’s genius in his later works. Pratchett throws down a whirlwind of ideas about this crazy magical world. Many are brilliant. There are also lots of amusing descriptions, sentences, worlds turned on their heads (som"
1543,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,2,"I've never really been a fan of British comedy. I see the attraction to stuff like Monty Python, Faulty Towers, et al, but the humor's vastly different then what I enjoy. I think it's the propriety or formality that throws me off. People compare Terry Pratchett's work to Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide series and that seems pretty approriate. Both are outlandish and filled with silly inanity. That being said, it's not my cup of tea. There always seems to be those scenes where characters apolog"
1544,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,5,"I have never read a fantasy book which was also a comedy. Terry Pratchett's wonderful world on the back of a giant turtle is just amazing. A unique blend of fantasy, science fiction and comedy, this book is a laugh riot from start to finish. The narration is often confusing because of lack of chapters or a straight storyline. But it is all irrelevant as there is no real story. The entire focus is on characters, parodies of other popular characters themselves and their interactions with the uniqu"

1548,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,"Although this was not as good as I'd expected it to be, it was easy and fun to read. I found myself marveling at how on earth could anyone come up with such crazy, ingenious ideas, and I was duly impressed. One such example: ""There was, for example, the theory that A’Tuin had come from nowhere and would continue at a uniform crawl, or steady gait, into nowhere, for all time. This theory was popular among academics. An alternative, favoured by those of a religious persuasion, was that A’Tuin was"

When I first read it in the non-graphic novel format, I felt it was confusing. Vague. Interesting, but strange. Not exactly good. Not exactly bad, either. Years later, I remembered that impression more clearly than I did the actual details of the book - even though I had a pretty good idea about the general plot and could recall Rincewind ending up on an airplane at one point. Since I've recently talked to somebody"
1550,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,"This book was my introduction into the mind and vivid imaginings of Terry Pratchett. What a book! I absolutely need to continue with the series now and there will be no stopping it. I LOVE the characters, especially the feisty chest, who each had me chuckling my way through this book. The world Pratchett has built is stunning and this first installment has only just grazed the surface, leaving me giddy in anticipation for what’s to come. I can’t wait to get back to Discworld!"

Readers learn about Discworld, a world that rides on the back of a giant turtle–called Great A’Tuin–swimming through space. We meet Rincewind, a cowardly failed wizard who has one of the world’s greatest spells lodged in his head, a spell so great that other spells refuse to stay in the same head, and Twoflower (with Luggage), a tourist from a far land who looks at the world through such rosy glasses that he believes nothing b"

1555,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,"To be honest, I am not really sure what I think of this book. I enjoyed it, certainly. It was wildly creative, of course. It basically reverses science and magic, making magic the real thing and science the myth; I suspect that residents of Discworld would find the book significantly less amusing than we do simply because so much of the humor comes from references to science which is not there. Case in point: ""It was as if the ocean had decided to create life without going through all that tedio"

The luggage was one of the most entertaining, I guess you could say, characters I've read in a while. I was always waiting for the luggage to barrel in and kick (bite) some ass. - Rincewind constantly groin kicking people - The sentient sword Kling - The Go"
1575,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,2,"I admit it. I am probably not the intended audience for this book. I don't like elf and sword fantasies and have not read many. Regardless, I thought a parody of that sort of fantasy would be a laugh for me and I've had countless people recommend Terry Pratchett to me over the years. Unfortunately this book fell flat for me and many of the references were beyond my realm of giving a shit. The introduction of a cast of forgettable characters from forgettable places was rushed and confusing. I was"

Rincewind, a wizard failure or one-spell wonder, becomes the guide for tourist Twoflower and The Luggage, and consequently our guide to the Discworld and its bizarre inhabitants, including dicing Gods. I like the absurdity of this world and the characters are distinctly different; especially liking DEATH but then I'd met and loved him in Mort . Liked this introduction well enough but unde"
1580,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,2,Quick review: This book is basically a collection of events with no real meaning. It's relatively short so I never felt much of a connection with any of the characters. There are some fun ideas like Twoflower's camera and the Luggage but I just wanted the book to be over around the 70% mark. This was my first Prachett/Discworld novel. I have others that I think I'll move on to that are hopefully more interesting and coherent. C-
1582,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,5,"There are many, many reasons to love this book - here are just two: Death and the Luggage. The Luggage never failed to cheer me up. A lesser writer would have stretched ten novels from the amount of ideas Pratchett crammed into one. If you are possessed of an imagination and a sense of humour, chances are you'll love this too."
1584,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,A solid 4.5; fun and funny. Will write a proper review later.

1589,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,"This was so much fun and I think you can tell how much influence this series has had upon fantasy today, not only in novels but film as well! By far one of my favourite things was discussing this with my father who read Discworld when he was my age and he was the one who recommended it to me in the first place!"

1593,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,"Thought this was very enjoyable. It is essentially four little episodes featuring the adventures of worst-wizard-ever Rincewind and eggo-nomics tourist Twoflower. You can obviously tell this was the first Discworld book by some jokes and caricatures being pretty on the nose, but I still found it very enjoyable. The satire of DnD and Fantasy tropes isn't as fresh now but good humor and fun doesn't really get old so I still enjoyed it and was left looking forward to more shenanigans. I thought Prat"
1594,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,"4.5 stars. Loads of fun, creative, and containing captivating action. Is it offensive to compare Pratchett to Adams? I get the distinct feeling that Pratchett really loves The Hitchhiker’s Guide, and decided to model Discworld from them. It is a labor of love and it works. How many of these damn books are there though?"
1596,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,"The Colour of Magic is the first book in Terry Pratchett's Discworld series. I have been reading and enjoying Discworld for many years now and this is the first time I've read the very first book. I understand why people recommend starting the series elsewhere and coming back to this one later. It reads as a series of four connected short stories instead of one cohesive novel. It is not a bad place to start your Discworld experience, it just isn't indicative of what the rest of the series will b"
1597,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,"3.5 Originally posted at Fantasy Literature . The Color of Magic, published in 1983, is the first book in Sir Terry Pratchett’s enormously popular DISCWORLD series. The Disworld is a flat world which rides on the back of four elephants which ride on the back of a giant turtle named Great A’Tuin. The DISCWORLD novels are humorous, satirical and spoofy, often making fun of their own genre and various real-world cultural and political issues and institutions. Before HARRY POTTER, Terry Pratchett was"
1598,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,1,"This book was not for me, and I'm a little confused why this series is so popular. Good things: -The world is quirky. It's clearly a well-built and complex thing. Pratchett obviously put a lot of thought into the whole thing and came up with stuff like ecosystems on the edge of the world. I liked that. -The luggage is awesome. Bad things: -Basically everything else. -The writing was in third person omniscient, which is I don't really enjoy to begin with, but that wasn't the only problem. There was soo"
1600,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,"While I have read other books in the Discworld series, I can definitely say that I am happy to have finally caught up and read the first installment. Pratchett here lays much of the groundwork for his wild imagination to build upon in further books, and establishes his humorous wit in turning the tables on standard fantasy tropes. There are indeed a few excellent turns of phrase that made me chuckle loudly, albeit not as many as in his later books, as Pratchett here seemed more intent on world b"
1601,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,"Back to the beginning of Discworld! Sort of. I had forgotten how much the world-building shifted. Yes, I said it was a bad one to begin with because of the changes. I remembered that Death was quite different in this book than the later ones. I remembered that the Patrician was quite different, too. What I did not remember was that Ankh-Morpork was also quite different, and in fact very Lankhmar. Death had considerable shades of Fritz Leiber -- unsurprisingly. This is a fix-up, not a novel. There"
1602,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,5,"I just adore Pratchett. The first thing I ever read by him was Good Omens , which of course, he co-wrote with Neil Gaiman. Some of the ideas, being very Gaimanesque, led me to the rest of Gaiman's books, but the snarky, playful humor is (mostly) all Pratchett. It took me quite awhile to figure that out, and to read anything in the Pratchett-universe. Since then, I've read several books in the Discworld series. I figured it was high time I started at the (sort of) beginning. Like the books, the rea"

I've decided that I'm not returning home just yet; apparently there are many more trips available to this world of luggage with feet and semi-transparent dragons and small gods and clever dialogue a"
1607,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,"3 stars - It was good. A light, silly and fantastical read that is highly original and creative. It has the feel of Disney, but made for adults and not at all predictable. I really enjoyed the author's frequent play on words which provided nerd humor throughout the book. I plan on continuing the series, but for me, this is definitely something I will have to be in the right mood/mindset in order to really enjoy it. --------------------------------------------- Favorite Quote: He wondered what kind"
1608,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,"3.5 stars This was my first Discworld novel. I had been expecting a hilarious fantasy parody and that's exactly what I got. I found myself chuckling again and again while reading this novel, my first foray into Pratchett's work, and was immensely impressed by his creativity and vivid imagination. His use of dialogue is masterful, even in this early work- which I've been told is the least well written of the series. I mostly enjoyed the plot, but found it a little too choppy for my taste.

1611,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,"This gets 4 stars instead of 5 mostly because I understand from the whole of the world of people who have read Discworld that it only gets better from here- so I figured I better leave room! What a fun, creative, fantastical, ridiculous book. Twoflower may well be one of my favorite characters in literature- we'll see if that pans out over time- and Luggage? I WANT SOME LUGGAGE. Hee. Rincewind, also, is a wonderful creation. Pratchett's imagination, and gift for puns, is a true joy. I can't wait"
1613,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,"Well... This was a bit weird. So many different things happened in so little time and sometimes it was hard to follow. The characters start in one place and find themselves in a totally different place at the end that one may find really weird. Still though, I love Pratchett's world and writing style, it can make you stop time to time and realize a different way to see things and I love that, since they are like tiny illuminations. Also, may I say Rincewind reminded me a falling, Balrog fighting"
1614,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,"what an amusing read! it was easy to get into this unique world where every possible fantasy trope resides. the dialogues are witty and they don't really generate a laugh but some chuckles and loads of smile. It's good to read something that's pointedly poking fun at many tropes and usual plot twists one finds in this genre. Reading this book as an adult is a different experience as the themes one would look for is largely absent. There is nothing subtle in the story, motifs exist as a satirical"
1615,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,"""Magic never dies. It merely fades away."" Well, it took me long enough to actually begin Discworld. I was told that this book would serve as a light introduction to the series. I loved the extensive, immersive, and quirky worldbuilding in this book. It took stock fantasy tropes and subverted them or took them to ridiculous lengths and was a thoroughly entertaining read. It was also strangely comforting to read that even in a world of absurdity and magic, people felt boredom and monotony and longed"
1616,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,"Terry Pratchett's The Color of Magic was thoroughly enjoyable! The book was a quick, thoughtful, and entertaining read. I also want to make it a point that I used the word entertaining and not funny. Ive seen a lot of reviews for this book use the word funny. Occasionally I did laugh and it seemed to be created for that purpose but this book is no joke.... Its Discworld... And it's a hell of a lot of fun!"
1617,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,"Having already read a few Discworld novels, I decided it was time to go back to the beginning. I really enjoyed the introduction to the world and characters like Death and descriptions of The Watch which all play larger parts in later books. The book is also incredibly funny ; it is at times a little confusing, but you're just best to go with the flow and know that eventually it will all come together :)"
1618,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,I've previously read the graphic novel version of this. One big difference between this and the graphic novel is that this is more humorous. One could make parallels between the Discworld novels and the Xanth series by Piers Anthony. The two series share a wacky sense of humor but I suspect that the humor remains stronger in Discworld.
1619,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,"This is not your average series of events, we meet Rincewind who becomes a guide to a tourist called Twoflower. After a strange conflagration, these two travel across the Discworld encountering many a weird adventure. It should be mentioned that this world is actually on the back of a turtle... So what about mating, dragons, the edge of this 'disc', gods, walking luggage, and board games?"

Anyway I loved it again, it is so quick to read and it just rollicks along with poor old Rincewind getting into all kinds of trouble.

1626,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,"This was my first experience with Terry Pratchett, although I’d seen enough comments about Discworld to have a general idea of what to expect. I was skeptical about reading it, because I knew it employs the type of humor that I just don’t seem to properly appreciate, but I was also curious about it. I’m talking about that unrealistic kind of humor that makes you laugh at the author’s cleverness, yet at the same time pulls you out of the story because it’s too ridiculous to take seriously. Is the"

Here are my thoughts in no particular order. * I hate prologues, so having a second prologue dropped on me a third of the way through the book was almost enough to make me toss my Kindle across the room. However, it did make it apparent that instead of a novel, this is really a collection of four short stories featuring the same two main characters. This was both good and bad -- good in that it skipped potentially uninterest"

It's amazing how an author that is so important to fantasy got overlooked by myself but I'm finally starting his books now. I wanted to go into Discworld without any baggage, so I waited a year after Pratchett's passing away before I dove into the series.

I love the fantasy genre and it just feels wrong to not know this author. I'm grateful to have received this book as a gift. The Colour of Magic is filled with, well, magic all over the place.

This is an incredibly episodic novel, and I'm not sure I identified any plot really. We bounced from event to event, some of which were so surreal as to be virtually unreadable.

From what I understand, the books do get better as the series meanders along, but I'm not going to buy more.

I was rather expecting to be blown away, but despite the well-crafted universe (who doesn't love a giant turtle), I was not amazed. The story is interesting, but inconsistently paced, and the beginning buts are much better than the end bits -- the sapient pearwood luggage ex machina gets a little old after awhile. Also, the novelty of Twoflower's naivete wears a bit thin -- the man should get a bit more worldly after all his crazy experiences. As"

1649,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,5,"I love Discworld. This is the start of my second read of the series. Quite an undertaking at this point. This, the first book, is strangely episodic. That's not a bad thing, it's just very different from what will come later. Having read the later books, I can spot the things that have been tweaked. (Namely, the Patrician. Huge tweak there.) But this is a great start to what would turn out to be a great series. And I still like Rincewind, believe it or not!"
1650,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,"A fun, chaotic book. It suffers a little in comparison to my first foray into Discworld - Guards! Guards! - since it was hard not to read Rincewind and Twoflower as less engaging versions of Vimes and Carrot. But it's still really delightful, packed with clever ideas and really well paced (as long as you don't mind your pacing frenetic)."
1651,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,5,The second best book I have read this year. (Ready Player One is still the best). I had been planning on delving into Pratchett's Discworld for a while and his passing made it more fitting to do so now. Why did I wait so long?!? This book is somewhere between amazing and hilarious while keeping you guessing and rooting for the characters. Pratchett was a mad genius and will be sorely missed. Thank you Terry for the Discworld. I will most definitely be continuing the series.
1652,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,"Ah, so whoever it was that advised me to start with the Watch books, instead of going by publication chronology, was completely right. Probably the most entertaining thing about these books is watching Pratchett working really hard to tune his funny. And there are flickers of that perfect pitch he has later, but mostly it's just sort of random-incidents-strung-together, and there's only occasional bits of there there."
1653,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,1,"This book frustrated me to no end. Very near the beginning of it, I thought about throwing it across the room because I could not for the life of me follow a conversation on about page 6. I read and reread and reread those pages to no avail. I finished the book because my husband told me it was wonderful and funny and I would really enjoy it. I didn't."
1654,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,"We just finished this up as a read aloud with my teens - this was their first foray into the Discworld, and while they didn't hate it, they didn't seem to love it either. Honestly, this isn't my favorite Discworld, but I thought we ought to begin at the beginning. I think when we do Small God's later this year they will enjoy it more."
1657,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,The first book in the Discworld series and clear evidence of the brilliance that is Terry Pratchett.

I listened to the point where Mogget the cat appears, and I'm not enamored with him eithe"
1739,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"4.5 stars. Good characters, strong world-building and an EXCELLENT magic/necromancy system that was very unique, well developed and internally consistant. With as much fantasy as I read, I am always thankful when I come across something truly unique and engaging. This certainly fits the bill. The magic of the Abhorsen and its connection and exploration of the ""various stages"" of death was very well done and, in my opinion, the best feature of the story. Will defintely read the next book in the s"
1740,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,"Protip: Don't google image search this book unless you're looking for Sam Winchester + Gabriel shipping. Now that I've got that warning out of the way. I was so conflicted about rating this book. It's sat there between a high 3 to a low 4, to be honest. But then I thought -- a younger Manda would probably have adored this book. My younger self, not having yet read as many fantasy novels as my old-fart-self, would have been absolutely in awe. What's not to love? Magic, zombies, juxtaposed to a Victo"
1741,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"This is one of the best books I came to pick up by chance at a bookstore. For me, this feels like high fantasy, though it actually could hardly be counted as that when looking at all the typical genre denominators which are missing here. The world the author has built is quite interesting all by itself: There is a wall separating the North where magic is very much alive and rampant, and the South which more or less boils down to a 1930s real world, from a technical point of view. In recent years, '"
1743,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,Sabriel is relentlessly brave and strong heroine. I liked the fact that this is a heroine centric novel. The description of place in the Ancient Kingdom was magical. I absolutely loved the Abhorsen's house on the river island. I wish I live in one. The names of the magical creatures were simple and didn't need a dictionary. I felt the ending was a bit rushed but that could be because I liked the book so much that I didn't want it end. Magical Read!
1744,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"5/5 stars “[the dead] were chanting and clapping, decayed hands meeting together in a steady, slow rhythm…a ghastly noise, hard sounds of bone on bone, or the liquid thumpings of decomposed, jellying flesh.” I loved this book. When I was reading it, I had the same feelings that I get when I am reading Harry Potter; it is like I know I am holding and reading a classic. Clarification: the plot and characters are NOTHING like Harry Potter, yet when I read the book, the same feelings were evoked as wh"
1745,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"You know sometimes when you read a book that’s just so good you get kind of overwhelmed and when you finish it you just need to cry to let all of your feelings out? Yeah. This. Fucking. Book. I read it a couple of times when I was a teenager but I haven’t read it for at least ten years, and let me tell you, it still holds up as an amazing read all these years later. SUMMARY Sabriel, a schoolgirl in Ancelstierre, is the heir to the role of the anti-necromancer, called the Abhorsen, and when her fat"
1746,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"Reviewed by Candace Cunard for TeensReadToo.com The first thing that hit me when I finished reading this book was that I should have read it much sooner. I'd been meaning to read it for the past six or seven years but never quite getting around to it--and that was a mistake. In SABRIEL, Garth Nix introduces the reader to a compelling fantasy world that comes alive through the actions of the title character and others. The Old Kingdom is a place of magic, both Charter magic, wielded by those with"
1747,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"This was my first book by this author and I loved it! Garth Nix writes extremely well. I really liked his world building and his original ideas. I especially enjoyed reading about Charter Magic versus Free Magic and the journeys into Death. Sabriel is a good, strong female lead, Moggett is wonderful and Touchstone redeemed himself by the end of the book. I read a lot of fantasy and this was one of the better ones I have read in ages."
1748,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,"I am not actually a fantasy reader yet I finally decided to begin with a new fantasy series! It is SABRIEL! Let's start with my favorite part, artwork! Sabriel [image error] Sabriel going into the Old Kingdom Touchstone Mogget (the cat that reminded me much of Coraline 's cat by Neil Gaiman .

1749,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"This was one of my first steps into fantasy/paranormal series back when I originally read it in middle school, and has stuck with me so much over the years that I recently re-read it. It is one of my absolute favorite books of all time, and the series itself is vastly under-rated, and not discussed nearly enough. First off, the world in this series is so fantastic. Really, it is two worlds in one. There is our world, and then there is the magical world that is separated from ours by a wall. The"
1750,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"I took an extended leave from the fantasy genre; yesterday afternoon, I decided to come back to the world of witchcraft and sorcery. Highly recommended by fellow peers, I chose Garth Nix's well-known 'Sabriel'. Frankly, I was so impressed and drawn into the story that I finished it in two days and rushed to write an amazingly complementary review. The plot was fantastic and fast-paced; there wasn't a moment I wasn't on the edge of my seat. Exhausting chapters of worthless garble is a common trait"
1751,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"Sabriel is a wonderful fantasy quest story that takes all the familiar tropes and makes them seem fresh and new. There really isn't anything that's groundbreaking in this novel, but it somehow seems like a story that's totally unique. Sabriel made me feel that same youthful excitement for reading that the Harry Potter books did, and it was much shorter. Nix did a fabulous job of creating a very rich, magical world in a small number of pages. This is proof that fantasy does not have to cover ten"
1752,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"Overall, this was a good, fun book. It took about half-way to really draw me in. It had a great climax, and the writing style is very pleasant. I plan to read the rest of the series. (The audiobook is narrated by Tim Curry, who is great at it.)"
1753,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"Excellent writing from Mr. Nix, excellent narration from Mr. Curry!"
1754,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,Unique magical world and engaging characters.
1755,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,Warning there may be a few spoilers ahead but I'm not bothering to hide them. Just be careful with those eyes of yours. 3.5 Stars I'm going to be honest and say that as an overall novel there were parts where this felt like a three star book and parts that felt four star. For instance upon reading the author's name this felt like a four star book (Garth Nix - good writer and a fellow Australian). But after delving fifty pages into the world of Sabriel I was less than impressed. However upon comple
1756,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"5 stars--it was amazing. And one million stars for the audiobook, narrated by Tim Curry. He's fantastic. This book has the coolest magic system I've ever encountered: the combination of sword, bells, magical marks, stones, and running water was really well done. It also combines an English schoolgirl ""keep calm and carry on"" dignity with necromancy--an uncommon pairing to be sure, but I loved it, and it really worked. Great characters, fun story, quick read. I wish I'd read it when I was younger."
1757,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"Set in a world that is divided into a medieval-esque Tolkien-like Old Kingdom and a certainly more modernistic Ancelstierre Sabriel is not exactly easy to get into. The juxtaposition of two countries that are ruled by completely different principles, namely magic and technology, is fascinating but not simple for it takes a great deal of time to comprehend the magic of the Old Kingdom. There is necromancy, Charter stones and magic, Charter ghosts, sendings, beings like the Mordicant and much much"
1758,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,"This one is the final read for the Tolkien Professor’s Faerie & Fantasy podcast seminar . I started out really liking the book as the world, and especially the necromantic magic system, we are introduced to was really rather clever and interesting. The story itself isn’t bad, a bildungsroman following a young girl, the titular Sabriel, who leaves her boarding school home to find out what has become of her father. Of course we soon find out that the boarding school, which appears to exist in"
1759,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,I'm happy to report I enjoyed this book just as much on a reread as an adult as I did when I first read it in 8th grade.
1761,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,"Bullet Review: I've got a lot to say about this, but I'm on my phone in an airport between flights so I'll write my full thoughts later. In the meantime: YAY for female protagonists! YAY for fantasy! HUH for what ""time period"" this falls into. HUH for the weird out-of-the-blue forced romance. HUH/YAY?! For the magic. Nonetheless, I would probably read further and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this, particularly to young adults with the caution about slight gore. Full Review: Sabriel is going to boarding"
1762,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"WOW!!! I know I am ridiculously late to the party but three words to sum this book up are Magical, Spellbinding and Astonishingly Good! (Okay, that's four but I had to whittle the list down from twenty five!) All I can say is Garth Nix can write, and I mean WRITE. He has this incredibly vivid imagination, a beautiful way with words, and crafts his story with love, care and precision. A few of the comments on GR have mentioned his writing style, it is a little different to what I'm used to, but i"
1763,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,"I remember being in high school and the librarian at the time recommended it. I'd finished all of the Eddings novels, was up to date with Harry potter and had read a few others. Unfortunately this never got going for me. I found the writing really great, the world intriguing but never really found the pace quick enough for my tatstes. Never did pick up the remaining books in the series. Seems to have a big following. I think at the time I was into a certain type of fantasy and this just wasnt it"
1766,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"Sabriel was is wonderfully written story. It’s high fantasy and full of magic, may seem complex. This book was very enjoyable, and I found that surprising. I expected it to be boring, but this book is the opposite! Right from the beginning you are thrown into the this new world with awesome magic. When Sabriel's father goes missing, Sabriel is willing to do whatever it takes to find him. She ventures into the Old Kingdom where magic runs free, but that is not always good. Free magic creatures run"
1767,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"Buddy read with Talia, Michelle, Sunshine, and CassieV! The world of the Old Kingdom and Ancelstierre is fascinating to me. Between the two of them, they seem to be a combination of classic medieval high fantasy and something of an Industrial Revolution/steampunk type of thing. Guns, bows & arrows and magic all have their uses as weapons in this world and that's something that I rarely see in fantasy books (then again, maybe I've just not been reading the right ones). And the whole aspect of"
1768,Sabriel,Garth Nix,2,"It’s a wonder I managed to finish this book since it bored me from beginning to end. The average book rating for Sabriel is above 4 so I guess I must have missed something. I had no idea Sabriel had been written in the 90s and that might be where the problem lies. The ya fantasy genre has evolved quite a lot since then (especially post Harry Potter) and Sabriel just feels like it lacks… something. I don’t know what exactly but the story and characters are just not engaging enough. Worse, they fee"
1769,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"Well that was a fun and exciting read! The minute I saw this book on GR, I knew it was going to be a hit with me. I don't know if it was the description of the story or the beautiful cover but this book was wonderful! The main character and heroine of the story, Sabriel, takes a dangerous and daring journey, a desperate mission to find her father, the Abhorsen. She's accompanied by a sarcastic, cat-like creature, Mogget and a young man, Touchstone, who's a bit touch and go. I really loved the worl"
1770,Sabriel,Garth Nix,2,"I'm a huge fan of high fantasy so I totally expected to love this series. But while I have nothing bad to say about Sabriel, it isn't a novel I'd quite recommend either. At least, not to seasoned readers of fantasy. If you've read your fair share of adult fantasy then the plot of Sabriel is simple and far too wordy for its predictability. It's nothing new and I'm somehow the only person on this planet who doesn't go ga-ga at a talking cat. So. If you're a fan of YA fantasy and looking for someth"
1771,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,3.5 from me - looking forward to reading the rest of the series. Will talk about it more in my wrap up video tomorrow :)
1772,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"As far as I can understand this book is particularly popular among friends of fantasy literature. It has many ratings in Goodreads and I find it on most of the lists with the best books of the genre, so in the end I said to leave my objsction behind and read it. Okay, I confess that the very nice cover has played a part in the decision, which is quite different from what I'm used to. This is an interesting combination of high fantasy and horror literature. The author creates the classical fantasy"
1773,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"It was lovely to reread Sabriel . I think I read it quite a few times when I was younger, but luckily, Garth Nix seems to have lost none of his charm for me. It helps that he has a female protagonist who isn't perfect, who ends up with a near-broken nose, battered to bits, and still finds love -- but that love isn't the most important thing: the important thing, the thing Sabriel really has to accept, is the passing on of her father's duties to her, and her own entry into adulthood. I enjoy the fa"
1774,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"I went out on a limb with this one. Necromancers aren't usually my thing, so I was pretty apprehensive. But its pretty obvious right away that it isn't your average raising the dead novel. Its so much better. Everything from the coldly beautiful gates of death to the spooky reanimated villains wowed me. Sabriel is short and sweet, and definitely worth the read. I think its neccesary to highlight how downright awesome necromancer lore is. Sabriel comes form a long line of Necromancers that have be"
1775,Sabriel,Garth Nix,2,"“Does the walker choose the path, or the path the walker?” This was not my cup of tea at all. It took all of my mental strength not to DNF it. First 70-ish pages were great, but then it just fell flat for me. (If you liked this book - Good for you! but probably dont read the next part, because some serious rant is going to follow). So what I did like: - the beginning, especially the prologue - it seemed this is going to be exciting high fantasy with amazing world, characters and backstories... ma"
1776,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,"Rating: 3* (and how it hurts to give them) of five I don't like fantasy novels much, and this one was no exception. I think the Overuse of Capital Letters in a Non-Ironic Context is tiresome. I think the willefull mispeling of wyrds to make them Magickal is annoying. And this book does both things. The character Sabriel was a dreary chit of a girl Caught Up In Magick She Doesn't Understand. Ugh. She has a familiar...a cat...whose name is Mogget. Oh now really! Why are the servants always named som"
1777,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"18/11/2015 After several years away from this series, I'm bumping this up to 4.5 stars. Because it's just that stinking good. The characters are wonderful, the world building is fabulous, I love the dramatic differences between the Old Kingdom and Ancelstierre, and I adore Mogget more than I can say. Basically, this is excellent. With a side of teen years nostalgia. 22/2/2012 I read this book in high school when it first came out, read it a few times throughout high school, and haven't read it sin"
1778,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"If I tell you that this book had magic, zombies and early 20th century technology, I'm sure your reaction will be: WTH? But believe it or not, the author managed to create a cohesive world that seamlessly mixes all these elements in a way that makes sense. The first part of the book was a bit slow because it was mostly Sabriel on her own. But once she gets some companions (a talking cat and a fellow mage), things become more interesting. Mogget (the cat) is particularly witty and Touchstone (the"
1779,Sabriel,Garth Nix,2,"Garth Nix put a lot of thought into building the world of Abhorsen. I could tell he spent hours thinking out every part of the old and the new kingdom and that he loved doing so. However, he failed to instill any excitement over that world and its characters in me. While reading I knew that the story had a well-written plot, but I didn't really feel drawn in like I usually do when reading a good book. Though the characters were rounded out and realistic, I didn't connect with anyone. Maybe it's"
1780,Sabriel,Garth Nix,1,"I was looking forward to this book, only because I've read Garth Nix's Keys To The Kingdom Series (which I have to say is much better than this). I unfortunately didn't like this book anywhere near as much as I'd hoped. I was let down that there wasn't much character development and that it's so difficult to read and eventually finish. I feel like this book dragged a lot and ended up skim reading the majority of the book. I very nearly put this in my DNF shelf and had to force myself to read it. I"
1781,Sabriel,Garth Nix,2,"Meh...I've been listening to this on the way to/from work (as is my wont with audiobooks as I can't focus on them outside of that confined environment). While Tim Curry does a good job of reading (though I couldn't stand his Moggett voice), I couldn't get engaged in either characters or story. SIDEBAR: This is my 3000th GR book though I think there really shouldn't be a celebration until I'm up to the 3000th read book."
1782,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"Even better the second time around, especially with Tim Curry narrating it."
1783,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"I had originally rated this YA fantasy at 4.5, but now find it a full 5 stars. Why the change? The world this book creates is so fun to think about. I'm delighted that the goodreads.com YA F&SF Discussion group is exploring this yarn as March's group reading: it's Nix's debut (jealousy!), and while it can stand alone (as it provides lovely closure), it's also followed by two other books rounding out a trilogy, which means I'll get to hang out in this world I love so well with characters so v"
1784,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"Sabriel takes place in two fictional countries: Ancelstierre ; a safe country (sort of like early 1920s England) where Magic does not work, and the Old Kingdom ; a dangerous place where the two types of Magic: 'Charter Magic' (good magic) and 'Free Magic' (bad magic) flow and where the Dead refuse to stay dead and instead roam freely. A wall separates the two countries. The main protagonist is an 18-year-old named Sabriel who leaves Wyverly College (an all-female boarding school she has known as"
1785,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"I really enjoyed Sabriel. I didn't have any expectations going in, and found it a unique and enjoyable ride. Set in an alternate early 20th Century England, Sabriel knows little more about the magical Old Kingdom across the wall than we do, and we all have to figure it out while on the run towards unknown danger in a kingdom that is clearly falling apart. As matters become more obviously serious, we encounter the malicious dead not staying in death, and Sabriel's incomplete training as a necroma"
1786,Sabriel,Garth Nix,2,"It's got some flaws (like very slow start) but it's not entirely hopeless either. That said, I've made it half way through and called it quits. I'll second what Susan said ""the heroine didn't have a lot to distinguish her, and some of the plot elements seemed overused (the prince thing really made me groan"") . To those grievances I'd add: - Cat sidekick! Hehe! Hhahahaaa!! NOT FUNNY Sheesh, a bit of a cliché, way to cutesy, and reminds me too much of anime crap. - The fact that it's not clear what"
1787,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"I've been on a bit of a fantasy kick lately, and Sabriel does not disappoint. The world Garth Nix creates is rich and expansive. It's darker fantasy, and the treatment of magic is much more deep and interesting than shouting a simple 'Expelliarmus!' Sabriel is the daughter of Abhorsen--A man who is a 'Good Necromancer', of sorts. Rather than raising the dead, he puts them to rest. It's a daunting task, and Abhorsen is the only one who can perform it. Sabriel finds out that her father is in troubl"
1788,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,"Full review. This book was well written and I can't deny that the second half of it was more interesting than the first, but nevertheless, I didn't feel a strong connection to the book. I felt like there's little action, but in reality the book was action packed, it seemed to me that the story lacked emotional connection. The colour and bindings that usually create not only good book, but also a book that is a page-turner. I was left intrigued though about what happened and what is going to happe"
1789,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,"Sabriel is the daughter of the necromancer, Abhorsen. He has placed her in a school outside the Old Kingdom, but she must return there to rescue her father, who is close to death. I did not care for Sabriel, who I found boring and without much mettle, except the need to save her father. On the other hand, I liked Touchstone, who seems to have more personality, perhaps from his earlier life, and whose character developed as the book progressed. I also liked the author's thin line between life and"
1790,Sabriel,Garth Nix,1,"It was a chore to read this book. Every once in a while, it got interesting, only to go back to a part that I had to slog through again. Sabriel herself wasn't very interesting. The magic wasn't explained very well--saying ""charter marks"" over and over again doesn't reveal a whole lot. A friend of mine loaned it to me with high a recommendation, and it was only because of her that I read more than a chapter or two. Even then, I had to stop at about halfway through. I simply could not force mysel"
1791,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"Probably not quite as fabulous as I remembered from my first reading a decade ago, but still quite good. I'll leave the rating at four stars. Certainly readable by fantasy fans who aren't into the typical modern YA scene, like myself. The world and the magic system are both unique and interesting. It's dark and a little dry, but I like that sort of thing. It does make me want to continue re-reading the original trilogy, to see what I've forgotten, and moving on to the two newer books, to see whe"
1793,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"Fantastic book. I've had people recommending this to me for ages, so glad I finally picked it up. The magical system and world was great, but it was Sabriel, her competence, prickliness and big heart that made this book extra special."
1794,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"I really liked this story. Good enough to go on with the series. ""Sabriel you're alive"" she says ""Yes, I am."" Nope, I wouldn't want to be an Abhorsen, Sabriel can take the job. lol"
1795,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,"Again, I blame this on being spoiled by writers who develop their worlds and their characters in detail. But just enough that everything makes sense. While this story is great, what bogs it down is the narrative - how short it is, how the author skimps on the detail, and in return, makes the world building messy and disjointed. I had to read the prologue three times after halfway through the first chapter because at one point we are left to think that the world is some quasi-middle ages place, an"
1796,Sabriel,Garth Nix,2,"A little disappointed by this one, and not sure why it's as popular as it is. I did really like some aspects, but overall this was just a drag. It took me forever to get through, despite the fairly simple writing style. Sabriel follows Sabriel (what a surprise) who inherits the position of the Abhorsen after her father gets into trouble. The Abhorsen is basically a necromancer who works for good, and banishes malevolent dead spirits back to Death. The magic system in this was really cool and I lo"
1797,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"I’m not a fan of YA literature but I will read anything by Garth Nix. His Seventh Tower series was one of my favorite books when I was a teen. His writing is great and his worlds and magic systems are intriguing. Sabriel is no exception. The story is set in a land almost like ours. People use guns, and many other forms of modern technology, but necromancy and other forms of magic are used. Sabriel enters the realm of the dead in order to rescue her father. Along the way she meets countless dead"
1798,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,"The writing is nice, the protagonist is great, and the world-building is interesting, but (perhaps because this is YA?) I found it lacking in character study/development (for everyone except the protagonist), and the franctic adventure pace led to the author rushing over parts which merited more explanation. Especially the ending! At the end, I couldn't help but think that if this book were written (or re-written) by Robin Hobb, it would be really brilliant."
1801,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"I knew a bunch of people loved this book but I was really relucant to read it because (full disclosure I never bothered to look into it beyond the cover) I assumed it was old-timey sword&sorcery fantasy with a dude protagonist and I was like no thank you, but it turns out it's actually portal fantasy with a girl protag AND HER TALKING CAT-SPIRIT-BEING sooo it's great!"
1802,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"""Death and what came after death was no great mystery to Sabriel. She just wished it was."" The first time I read this book I did not like it and had to abandon it at page 25. Now after having finished the whole thing in less than 36 hours, I realized I hardly gave it a fighting chance and that wasn't fair because it's actually good. Garth Nix surprised me in that all the objections I had about Sabriel as a character are remedied later on in the book. I have never been bored enough with a book to"
1803,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,"This took me a REALLY long time to finish, mostly because I just wasn't hooked until I was over 100 pages in. Sabriel is kind of the setup book. It takes awhile to find your footing in the story, and there are so many things going on, and information to learn. Plot-lines being woven in that will probably have more significance in the next books. But the world was interesting, and I loved the characters. Sabriel, Touchstone, Mogget. They all had their own distinct personalities, and I thought tha"
1804,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"This is a good book. It's a well told story. It's a fantasy world that is at once familiar and strange. It's mysterious, if it has the occasional moment of, ""Well, that's convenient."" (view spoiler) [Mogget being the fourth charter would be one of them. Touchstone being of royal blood and as such being the first would be another, were it not for the fact that I expected that the second Sabriel brought him back from the land of the dead. The other major convenience being when they suddenly realize t"
1805,Sabriel,Garth Nix,1,"I guess Garth Nix has a following, but I personally can't see it. The whole book felt, in a word, amateurish. For one, the dialogue was unwaveringly wooden, so that the characters barely showed themselves and then only after many pages. The description of the world was pretty, but often overly ornate and adjective-laden. The bits of attempted romance were sudden and bizarre. So I was working hard to stay in the story. Let's talk about the story, though. It's ridiculously convenient. In every othe"
1806,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"4.5 - I really enjoyed this book. It was a well paced and highly creative YA novel. The system of magic is especially unique and interesting. Sabriel’s magical abilities are channeled through bells. Sound and harmonics are a strongly woven theme throughout the novel. To me, it was reminiscent of the concept known as Music of the Spheres. I have only two criticisms of this novel. Foremost, I was disappointed in the lack of character development in the main character. While I was drawn in by plot,"
1807,Sabriel,Garth Nix,1,"Just a ridiculous first novel. I got a shock when I learned part way through the book that the heroine was eighteen. She acts like a child of nine. She continues this for the rest of the book, no matter what obstacles she faces, no matter how many chances she's given to learn. The only time she's not acting nine is when she's crying over what she thinks is this hunk sidekick falling into bed with a tart. She's still silly as hell though. What was I thinking picking up this book? In the book's de"
1808,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,This was my very first fantasy book that I've ever read and I'm not sure that I'll be in a hurry to read another one.

Sabriel must journey into the mysterious and magical Old Kingdom to rescue her father from the Land Of Dead. Although her journey begins alone she soon finds companions along the way such as Mogget and Touchstone who are powerful creatures of the the magical wo

So I'm, like, years late on this one, but a decade later, I would like to assure you all that you were totally right, this is a great series! This first book is a bit wandery in places – you can sort of see him figuring out what he's doing – but it has something . I think it's that this series makes a lot of the usual moves – talking cat, death of a trusted adult,"
1810,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,"I found Nix's world where Sabriel is born to step into death and enforce the boundary of death and life very intriguing. The nine gates to death, the bells that control the dead, the different forces set to keep control over death, Mogget forced servitude, Sabriel's excursions into death, all very vivid in my imagination. It did take Nix a while to get into the story and at times I was confused by his descriptions, but when the story got intense, I found myself very involved and anxious for Sabr"
1811,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"this was a great yarn. i think of this trilogy as often as i think of harry potter. in some ways i like it quite a bit more. (of course it's apples to oranges - and harry potter rocks.) sabriel starts off dark though, and the darker harry potter books are better. (according to me) it could be because they are more developed. sabriel starts off dark. she doesn't take 3 years of hogwarts to get there."
1812,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"Absolutely delightful. I was really expecting this to feel like a teenage fantasyishesque story, but I was pleasantly surprised. Sabriel was much darker than I expected and I loved every page of it. Add in a nice unique magic system and this makes for an enjoyable read that was easily strong enough to force me to read the rest of the books in the trilogy. Well done mate...er...Garth Nix!"
1813,Sabriel,Garth Nix,2,Sabriel is the daughter of the necromancer Abhorsen and has magic like her father. Had been at a boarding school for most of her life she finds out her father is missing and now must search for him but danger awaits her. I couldn't get into this book I felt like I couldn't connect to the characters.
1814,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"I loved this. I was blown away by the magic system which I thought was one of the most interesting and uniquely designed that I seen in a while. The world was exotic but believable, and the story was just terrific. Definitely a new favorite in the YA fantasy genre."
1815,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,Finally starting this... Here we go! ***** Adored it!!
1816,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,"""Let this be my final lesson. Everyone and everything has a time to die."" I didn't know a lot about this book when I started reading. The series has popped up in discussions with friends over the years, but no concrete details were ever given, so I didn't really know what to expect. I've always just been told to read it. While there were a lot of things about this book that I enjoyed, including the world and magic, there was also a lot that felt lacking. Sabriel was an interesting character and"
1818,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"I enjoyed this book overall, though I thought that there were some flaws in it. Not big enough to keep me from being very engaged and from feeling satisfied when I was done, but enough to catch my attention and detract a bit. Still, it was worth reading. No kidding. Serious spoilers below. You have been warned. At the core, this is a traditional epic quest fantasy novel. Girl, on the verge of adulthood, is thrown into great events and has to grow in order to overcome the Great Enemy. She discovers"
1820,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"August 2016 2 years later and this is still amazing. -- January 2014 I am so glad that someone recommended this book to me, because it was a fantastic read . I am a HUGE sucker for the fantasy and adventure genre, as long as it's not downright confusing. I admit that during the prologue, I had a hard time following what was happening, but other than that, I knew what was going on. The story starts off, after the prologue, with Sabriel at her boarding school in Ancelstierre. After finding out that her"
1821,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"I thought Sabriel hit the ground running from the very first page, but it took me several pages to adjust to Garth Nix's writing style. I've read other reviews where people mention having a hard time getting into the story, and I think I know why. Not unlike Tolkien, Garth Nix includes a lot of exposition, imagery in detail in his narrative.Unlike Tolkien, though, Nix doesn't explain everything in his fictional universe, so as a result, I spent a good portion of this book in a state of confusion"
1822,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"Audiobook performed by Tim Curry 4**** When her father goes missing, a young woman must leave her (relatively) safe boarding school to go up against the Dead creatures who are threatening not only the Old Kingdom, but all society. What an extraordinary fantasy adventure! I have to admit that when I began the novel I was struck by similarities to a certain young wizard – mark burned on the forehead at birth, orphaned, sent to boarding school, just beginning to learn the craft of magic, and up again"
1823,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"[clears throat] [licks nutella from fingers] [puts lid back on nutella] [straightens] [clears throat again] I first heard about this series last fall from the lovely ladies over at Epic Reads. [waves] I was kind of ""eh"" about this, but I was jealous of their whole fun read along, and everyone said these books were super good, so I added them. And thank you, Epic Reads, because this book was great. This book is like Harry Potter meets Berlin during the Cold War meets early twentieth century meets the Gri"
1824,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,"This was an enjoyable read but ultimately there wasn't a lot of substance to it. The main character, Sabriel, was OK but I kept comparing her to the Discworld character Susan Sto Helit the whole time. The novels came out around the same time though Pratchett's was released first and are very similar, the daughter of Death, and I prefer Susan so much more. I also felt the world it was set in was very weak. There were only small glimpses of the time period it was set, I wasn't sure if it was supps"
1825,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"I've always loved Sabriel, and the world it introduces -- I like this trilogy more than the other Garth Nix books I've read, in general, but Sabriel might have been my favourite of the three because it can stand alone, and I loved the characters of Sabriel, Touchstone and Mogget. I loved all of the characters, really, even the ones we only have brief glimpses of, like General Horyse. It's a good introduction to Sabriel's world, since she both knows enough that she's not completely over her head,"
1826,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,"I came into this book with high expectations because it is suppose to be one of the best fantasy series out there. I am sad to say that this series may not be for me. I didn’t hate this book but it was just okay and it didn’t move me in any way. Sabriel was a great character. She was spunky, determined, resourceful and a bit standoffish. I liked that she was layered but I didn’t connect to her and her plight as much. Every other character except her father was forgettable. They did not leave a la"
1827,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"Sabriel is one of the best fantasy books out there, full stop. Although not up to the deep literary analysis of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings or Pullman's His Dark Materials, it is a realistic, fantastical, intriguing and thought-provoking novel that's right up there with the best of them. Garth Nix creates a dark, almost Gothic world that echoes with age and believability that is intoxicating to explore: the magically-imbued Old Kingdom that lies across the Wall from the more scientific-orientate"
1828,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"This is a very solid young adult fantasy. It's got some aspects that are unlike anything I've seen, and others that are more familiar, but well done. The characters are interesting, and the evolving relationships, thankfully, more subtle than a lot of more recent books. And a focus on necromancy for a book meant for teenagers? Interesting.... Note: The rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the changes in Goodreads policy and enforcement. You can read why I came to this decision here . In th"
1830,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,Such a fascinating magic system!
1831,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,Well this was an excellent first book. I truly loved the world and story and already bought the second book!
1832,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"Necromancy! Female Lead! Certainty of death! Epic quests! Small chance of success! Why did I wait so long to read this book? I first heard of ‘Sabriel’ on my quest for female led fantasy. I was probably twelve. My interest faded after failing to find the book in local stores. Fast forward to a Canadian used bookstore, where I stumble upon not only ‘Sabriel’, but the sequels! To top that off, the cashier gave me a discount so I could buy the whole set. (Companion Books, Burnaby, BC. Very nice shop"
1833,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"Rating: 9.5/10 INITIAL THOUGHTS Simply Amazing!!! Given the book’s reputation I shouldn’t be surprised, but the truth is I’m VERY surprised by just how great Sabriel is. I assumed (mistakenly as it turns out) that I had left it far too late in my life to read it. In theory Sabriel is a children’s story (I don’t agree with that ascription now I’ve read the book) so I had no expectation that I would end up reading one of my all-time favourite fantasy novels. But that’s what has happened. At first glan"
1834,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"I don't really have a lot to say about it, so I suppose I won't be writing a super long review. Sabriel was mostly an okay read for me. It mostly read like a 4 star book and there weren't necessarily any moments where I was like YES, OH MY GOD, THIS IS SO GOOD. I liked the characters and story well enough, with Mogget being especially interesting. But, somehow, this felt as if it was written like 20 years ago, which it was, but what I'm trying to point out is the lack of timelessness. Aside from t"
1835,Sabriel,Garth Nix,2,"I am invoking the 100 page rule and giving up. I don't do this often enough. This came to me from Book Club, and I do try to read a range of genres, but it's a perfect reminder that Young Adult fantasy really isn't my thing any more. I wanted to give it a go, as this has good reviews, but apart from anything else, it's a series of five, and I really don't need to embark on this particular quest. I may have enjoyed it more if there had been some humour, or if the heroine had a personality (maybe th"
1836,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"Sabriel is classic fantasy book that has been on my reading list since 2011 (according to Goodreads). Basically, I knew I wanted to read it since I first read the blurb, but for whatever reason, I didn't give it the attention I knew it deserved. Until now. Having finished the audio version yesterday - narrated by the fantastic Tim Curry - I find myself wondering: WHAT WAS I THINKING not reading this sooner? WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME? WHAT IS LIFE? Gah! Yes, this book is THAT good. I officially have a"
1837,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,Finally getting around this series. The beginning was overwhelming but glad it all came together by 40%. It was heavy on the fantasy and gave me Sanderson vibes. I adored Sabriel and can't wait to read the next installment. PS - So bummed about the cover changes.
1838,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,A phenomenal novel. I can't believe that it has taken me this long to get around to reading it. Big thanks to my parents for getting me the trilogy umpteenth Christmases ago. Loved the ideas behind the book and where the plot went All the coming of age shenanigans without the tropes Delightful bit of necromancy. Sassy cats. I'm in love. I might marathon the series.
1839,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"I’m surprised how much I enjoyed this, and not even because of Tim Curry’s narration. Ok though a large part of my initial enjoyment was Tim Curry’s narration. Especially for Mogget."
1840,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"This book has literally been on my TBR list for years. It was an excellent example of sword and sorcery fantasy, a genre I have never been that fond of. This kept me interested, and that is saying something."
1841,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"Rating 3.5 stars I am usually pretty generous with my ratings. I will give a mediocre book 3 stars, I rarely ever give a book a 1 star (usually I would stop reading a book long before that happens). I also tend not to give a whole lot of 5 stars either. So I have a habit of rating books between 2.5 and 4.5 stars (about 95% of all my ratings) That is why I try to write a review for each book I read to communicate how I felt about a book, because I could rate one book 3.5 stars for a completely di"
1842,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"Read if you enjoy The Blue Sword or Skulduggery Pleasant , possibly Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone 3.5 stars Glancing through all my Goodreads friends' varied reviews, I see I am once again playing catch-up on an already popular novel. And there is a good reason for its popularity. Sabriel is action filled story with an original fantasy world and cool characters. It is very '90s but that is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, I found its style throwback and fun compared to present day YA"
1844,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"Sabriel is the first book set in the Abhorsen Universe and introduces us to the character of Sabriel who is literally in the process of finishing at at her school when her father goes missing! :D The only catch being that her farther is the Abhorsen, who is a kind of good Necromancer, and as a consequence she has to inherit the job and travel into the Old Kingdom to deal with her father's disappearance and the evil undead that are looking to take over the world! :D The world building in Sabriel i"
1845,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"I discovered this book my senior year of high school, when a couple of my friends in drama club were reading it. Having always been a fan of fantasy, I ran to the library and picked it up, although I remember being rather surprised that it had been published in 1995. The Harry Potter craze was in full swing in 2003 and I thought Sabriel was riding on its coattails, like so many books are still doing today. But no, not only is it incredibly original, it is also unique and scary. Sabriel kicks some"
1847,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,"I have had this book sitting around in my bookshelf for at least five years because after buying it, it never appealed to me to start it until recently. It started off very slowly, which is why it is only getting three stars because it wasn't really until half way through I felt truly compelled to read it. However saying that the second half was really quite good and I would like to read the sequels sooner rather then later. I have a feeling they will be better or at least I hope so. There were a"
1848,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"Another book I really owe a debt of thanks to my Dragons and Jetpacks group for steering me towards as a Book of the Month. The author Garth Nix hits a lot of great notes with this book. The lead character is fun to read. Sabriel is a young woman suddenly shoved into a situation she wasn't ready for. She makes mistakes, but that makes perfect sense because she's so young and inexperienced. The magic system is richly detailed and wholly unique. And the world Nix created is nicely detailed and cre"
1849,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"you know how no matter how many times you have macaroni and cheese, it's still delicious? that's kind of how i feel about this series. it was a childhood favorite of mine, and occasionally coming back to it is like having a serious helping of comfort food. for anyone who's tried fried chicken, mashed potatoes and chocolate cake (like, ex. tamora pierce, phillip pullman, and yes, j.k.r.), and still has room for more, i suggest this dish to fill up the corners. basic plot: sabriel is a necromancer-"
1850,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"More Reviews Here: Readers Live A Thousand Lives I adore high fantasy books, so it’s kinda surprising I hadn’t read Sabriel yet. I mean, this book has become like high fantasy legend so I really had no excuse. I’m so glad I finally got to this one because it was a great read. The characters and the story and the world were fantastic. This is such hard core high fantasy and I absolutely loved that. Sabriel is an awesome heroine and I loved her. She is so strong and resilient and determined. She is"
1851,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,"3.75, because I didn't really understand some key aspects of the mythos. This book reminded me strongly of The Edge series by Ilona Andrews , given that a magical medieval world (Old Kingdom) borders a technological mundane kingdom (Ancelsteire, similar to England 1910). However, On the Edge is more thoroughly steeped in the romance genre narrative, while SABRIEL only includes a hint of romance. It's a Young Adult coming-of-age fantasy involving necromancy and two forms of magic: free magic and c"
1852,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"Sabriel is on the cusp of deciding between continuing her mundane education in Ancelstierre or returning to the kingdom of her birth in order to practice magic. Then a shade appears with her father's voice and objects of office, and Sabriel's choice is made for her. She has inherited the mantle of Abhorsen, and as such is the only defense against the Dead. Pursued by creatures made of decaying flesh, magic, and an unending murderous thirst, Sabriel searches the Old Kingdom for the necromancer at"
1853,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"I wish I would have read this book when I was thirteen! My thirteen year old self would have *loved* this story. I would have crushed on Touchstone, laughed at Mogget and wished I was Sabriel--well, not really. I don't think I would have wanted to be an Abhorsen. *shaking head* nope. I didn't read this when I was thirteen (which wouldn't have been possible anyways since it was first published a year after I graduated high school), I read it a few months before my 40th birthday, which is a *fine* t"
1854,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,"With the fourth full length novel, CLARIEL, due to be published later this year, I thought I'd get reacquainted with the Old Kingdom trilogy beginning with SABRIEL. The first book in this unique and spellbinding series follows Sabriel, a teenager who learns of her fathers impending doom from across the wall in the Old Kingdom; a place rife with magic and dead things. As she travels this dangerous landscape the quest conforms to the formulaic trappings of adventure fantasy; accumulating loyal fol"
1855,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"Wow, I did not see this book coming. I guess since I had never heard of it and it's older, I expected it to just be 'meh.' Wrong! This book is fascinating, beautiful, poignant, surprisingly action packed, unique...and I could go on and on. At first, I couldn't help but feel like Sabriel was like so many other stories with the necromancers, the wall, and the seven gates of hell. But as she crossed into the Old Kingdom, and we discovered the world together, I was blown away by how ingenious everyth"
1856,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,"3.5 stars ""Does the walker choose the path, or the path the walker?"" Exceptional! I really enjoyed Sabriel . When I first picked it up, I thought it was a middle grade book, the simplistic writing certainly made it seem so more. But no, this is a YA fantasy, a great one at that. I keep getting caught up in new releases (that end up being mediocre), so it took me a while to pick up this book that was published a while back. ""I love you. I hope you don't mind.""

1857,Sabriel,Garth Nix,1,"I'm not really one for craftily worded and deep fantasy's. I like cool inventive stories, but not the confusing and over abundant description that seems to come as a package deal with a fantasy novel. Sabriel was a novel that I couldn't click with. It wasn't particularly difficult to understand, vocabulary wise, but I couldn't make the words sink in. The sentences were so long and complex that I had to reread several times. Thus, taking away any enjoyment that could possibly be granted. I'm part"
1858,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"One of my absolute favorite books of all time. It's so very very wonderful. I reminisce about it quite often. While its YA genre, I don't think of it that way. There's none of the usual YA stuff - silly teenagers, love triangles, etc. The heroine, Sabriel, is mature, competent, strong, brave, admirable. She's not fluffy. Besides Sabriel, the entire concept of the book is amazing. It's morbid, unique, enthralling. Basically, Sabriel is a necromancer (cool, right?) & she has to journey across"
1859,Sabriel,Garth Nix,2,"UPDATED 8/12/15 I really tried this time. I let my old disinterest go, started anew, and was still highly disappointed. There were really good action scenes and had so much potential to be more. I just found it completely lacking. Most of the characters were bland and the interesting ones didn't have enough page time to shine. The ending was stupid and I didn't like Sabriel's POV. It would have been better to have a narrator. And I know this is typically the kind of book I devour and love but not"
1860,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"Teen necromancer fights baddies in a weird split world where half the land seems to have early 20th century level technology, and the other half is a medieval magical kingdom where technology doesn't work. Pretty fun fantasy adventure story, a bit old fashioned in some ways and ahead of it's time in others. Maybe a bit too fast-paced for it's own good, some of the big moments needed a bit more time to breathe I thought. But it doesn't have that heavy portentous nonsense that bogs a lot of fantas"
1861,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,"Though its premise may sound interesting, I have a couple of problems with this book. Apart from the fact that the translation sucked, Sabriel (the main protagonist) felt like a 15-year-old girl (when she's actually 18). Also I think it lacked world building and I didn't believe the romance either. I hope it gets better in the next one A pesar de que este libro tiene una premisa interesante, tuve un par de problemas con él. Dejando de lado que la traducción es malísima, Sabriel (la protagonista p"
1862,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"Sabriel is at school in Ancelstierre when she receives a message from her father that he is in danger. He sends her his bells, the tools that he uses as a necromancer to send the dead back where they belong. Sabriel must journey home to the Old Kingdom, where magic works, to reach her home and save her father. But danger lies in her path, and she doesn't know who she can trust. Sabriel makes her way north, bravely wields her father's bells against creepy dead spirits, has a magic cat-like compani"
1863,Sabriel,Garth Nix,1,"The fantasy genre is almost always hit-or-miss and unfortunately for myself, Sabriel was another miss. Garth Nix was commended by Wikipedia for dodging the genre-definining fallacy of extensive world-building in place of actual plot. I would agree, Nix does an excellent job of avoiding details about anything at all until the plot calls for it. Nothing is explained, nothing means anything, and so I finished the book feeling duped. There is no story worth hearing between these covers:/ please don'"
1864,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"I read this on David's recommendation. I have to say that I enjoyed it, but it didn't grab me to start with. The worldbuilding was truly original, but the heroine didn't have a lot to distinguish her, and some of the plot elements seemed overused (the prince thing really made me groan). But this book really grabbed its fire for the last 1/3. The final confrontation with evil was nothing short of brilliant. It was tight, unexpected, and riveting. I couldn't put it down. I'll definitely read the next"
1865,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"It's a good book and I liked it. Full of adventures, the orgin of fantasy genre, ant not one of those ""fantasy"" books that can be found nowadays, whick actually focus more on the romantic aspect and fit YA genre a lot more. The only thing that bothered me was that it was written from third person narrative, and for this reason I couldn't connect with the characters deeply, and lots of grammar mistakes, but I blame translators and redactors on this one. After all, I highly recommend it to all fant"
1867,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"I really enjoyed reading, because it has good characterization and lacks cliches. I just find that it has lot of wasted pages, which is annoying since it is short book. But, reading about Sabriel and her adventures in Old Kingdom was such pleasure I can't give this book less that five stars. If you hate Mary Sue and damsel in distress this is the book for you. Plot of this book is filled with dead and Death, and I thought I won't enjoy that, but I fond it quite entertaining."
1868,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"This is seriously one of my new favorite books, I canNOT believe how much I loved it. It deserves to be so much more well known then it is! From the first page of the prologue to the very last word, I was completely hooked. I am going to have to get the other two books of the trilogy as soon as I can. There are a ton of good reviews, so I'm not going to summarize it again. Besides, you don't need a summary. You need to read this book. Immediately."
1869,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"I own this book, but this time through I listened to the audiobook. It's narrated by Tim Curry. Tim Curry!! His voice was *PERFECT* for this. He did an exceptional job, especially with Mogget's voice. I am NOT a cat person, but oh how I love Mogget! Garth Nix created a world that makes me want to cuddle up in a big, cozy blanket with a nice, hot cuppa and just get lost in the pages."
1872,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"Listened to this one for the second time recently, because I needed to revisit a favourite where things are horribly stressful and yet shit still gets done. Love this book and Garth Nix's world building. Tim Curry's narration of the audio is lovely as always."
1873,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"This one I read a year ago (though I know it's been around a LONG time). Really enjoyed it! Dark, inventive, gripping, with a dynamic heroine. LOVED the world-building and the magic system. Will definitely re-read this one, maybe even soon . . ."
1874,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"I'm not the biggest fan of straight-up fantasy (I personally have a hard time getting into a different world. Just a personal bias.), but pair Tim Curry's narration with some epic battling of the Dead and you have a pretty good story on your hands."
1876,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"This is classic fantasy at some of it's best, though I still had some moments of frustration."
1877,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,Definitely a unique universe... Looking forward to book 2.
1878,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,Garth Nix is a familiar name in the fantasy world and I first encountered him through the wonderful SABRIEL. Nix is a member of that amazing and fast-growing collection of Australian young adult authors and one I would love to meet as his worlds are so expansive and well-thought-out. It would be fun to pick his brain about the creation process. This was another of those golden selections for my old Young Adult Reading Group and we had so many wonderful conversations surrounding the intricate and
1879,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"Finally! A fantasy book that has a believable female main character! Where have you been hiding from me Mr. Nix all these years? Sabriel is a calm young woman who knows what needs to be done. She is utterly human and imperfect. She isn't a typical badass, ""one-of-the-boys"" kind of girl who always has a witty comeback ready. She just wants to save her father and she doesn't fawn over Touchstone the entire book. Romantic love is just a side-story! It's amazing. Read this novel!!! The story is dark"
1880,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"Why has it taken me so long to discover this series?! I love fantasies with magic that feels ancient. In Sabriel, the magic is just that; old, hard to control and occasionally painful. The old kingdom is separated from the rest of the world with a wall, and the dead roam the old kingdom's roads. The Abhorsen has the duty of forcing the dead where they actually belong. Sabriel read like a beautiful cross-over between Harry Potter and the Earthsea series (by Ursula K. Le Guin). The world and magic s"
1881,Sabriel,Garth Nix,2,"2.5 stars Sabriel and the Abhorsen series are a classic, and so many of my bookish friends have loved it, so I wanted to give it a try. 1. The style is really weird: it's not quite middle-grade fiction but the character development wasn't YA-caliber either. While I didn't hate ""Sabriel,"" I also didn't love it. Heck, I really didn't even like it. It would be more accurate to say I endured it, finishing only because I started very liberally skimming the endless paragraphs of descriptions and fights."
1882,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"2016 Reading Challenge: A young adult novel It's fairly uncommon that I really like books labeled as “Young Adult” fiction. Too often, they're silly teenage romances with a thin veneer of story slapped on, and those set in speculative fantasy or science-fiction worlds seem to lack a lot of oomph in the world-building. But Sabriel is proof that sometimes less is more. The obligatory teen romance is barely there, and not handled with any of the usual annoying giddiness and moping. Likewise, Garth N"
1883,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"This was kind of different than what I usually read, but I'm glad I read it. It is kind of slow moving and there's a section where she's just traveling on her own that moved really slow for me, but I did really like Sabriel as a character. The magic system is fun, a little confusing at first but I did like it. Moggett was hilarious and probably my favorite part of the story. I did like Touchstone too, he was sweet. This was really probably a 3 star read for me, but I think I just didn't apprecia"
1884,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"A fantastic teen fantasy novel about a young girl assuming the role set out for her in youth to follow in her father's footsteps. I always enjoyed Garth Nix books in the past, but I was worried they wouldn't feel as compelling now I'm older. The novel was fast paced and very interesting, I only wish there had been more."
1886,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,Why did it take me so long to read this? Necromancy and a cat companion? I also really enjoyed how awesome Sabriel was.
1887,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"Thoroughly enjoyed that! Complex magic systems, terrifying demons, an unapologetically girl as the lead, and one magical cat with a grudge."
1888,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,It took me a while to get into the story but once i did i loved the characters and the world and i cant wait to continue.
1889,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"me, crying at the end of this book: yeah it was okay. ;_; I'm gonna wait a little while to listen to the rest of these because while I'm sure they're good I know they focus on someone else and I'm not ready to move away from Sabriel."
1890,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"I really enjoyed the book. It moved quickly and had the right amount of fantasy meets modernity blend to it. I can see why so many of my friends loved reading this book. I look forward to eventually continuing the series, but I could also feel content to just read Sabriel and call it a day because it had such a fitting ending."
1891,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,"The beginning of this was delightful but raised high expectations that weren't really met by the rest of the book. I was going to say that it's unfair to judge a YA book for lacking depth, but there are a lot of YA fantasies that do much better. It often read like it was intended to be made into a movie (at times distractingly so) and I think it would be very well suited for adaptation."
1892,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"It surprises me a little that this gets shoved into the ""teen"" category. Not sure why. Yeah, it's a recently out of school 18 year old saves the world story...questing for a parent in peril...coming into her own identity as a chosen one... With sidekicks... And a mysterious Oracle - like helper... Yeah I guess all the tropes are there. But the writing is just goooood. It feels higher stakes than teen. So much scarier than teen. Like, why does Pat Rothfuss' freshman in magic college story get she"
1893,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"Before the internet, the way I found new books to read was very different, if more simple. I would go to the library (or, on the occasion I actually had spending money, the bookstore), pick every book up that looked even remotely interesting, and take it home. Then I would read it. I was in no way discerning about which books I would read. This method had its downsides, the biggest of which was that I frequently ended up reading books I didn’t care for all that much, but at that point in my life"
1894,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,"I get why a ton of people love this book. The magic system is incredibly well-developed and fairly interesting -- I may not like magic that works by a system of arbitrary rules, but I know plenty of people who read just for such things. The plot is fast-paced -- I may be tired of stories where the all of the conflict derives from the protagonist not having information that everyone else in the story has, but again, I am aware that this is simply one of my own person pet peeves. And, of course, w"
1895,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,5 stars Good start to the Abhorsen trilogy. Liked the characters. Can't wait to read more books from the author!!!!
1896,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"How does one do justice to Sabriel? A groundbreaking novel with world building that's hard to match, I went in hoping to absorb Garth nix's wonderful sense of place and time in his world, and found myself loving the journey at every step. Garth blazed a trail for Australian fantasy with this title, which holds up today as a masterful piece of storytelling with a great sense of identity and poise."
1897,Sabriel,Garth Nix,2,"SPOILERS! After reading the reviews on Sabriel, I was eager to see what Garth Nix was going to offer me. Eager in a good way! Unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations. One of the reasons the book fell short was because of the characters themselves. Even with Sabriel as the protagonist, I hardly got to know her. I understand that she was young and that she is venturing off into a world that she was kept ignorant of up until the disappearance of her father. I understand that she that seems t"
1898,Sabriel,Garth Nix,2,"Sabriel by Garth Nix (awesome name, by the way) is the first in a series of fantasy novels for young adults. It features the eponymous girl, who is the latest in a long line of Necromancers --magicians who deal with death and getting the dead to shuffle around on this side of the grave. Only Sabriel's clan is unique in that they specialize in putting the dead back down and protecting the world from them. So when her father dies, Sabriel has to shoulder the mantle of his office --until she can tr"
1899,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"I read an article today (stolen from another GoodReader's page) about how difficult it was to sell YA novels before the Harry Potter phenomenon. The article said that Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was a huge hit...at 4K units sold in 1998. Not to malign a book that I thought was meh, but Hush, Hush -- a book many openly criticized for many different reasons -- has sold about 25K units since it was released in 11/2009. The genre is a lot different, and much more popular than it was ten ye"
1900,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"I was trolling around the internet, looking for something to read after I finished the last in the Harry Potter series and Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials series, when I read a review of The Abhorsen Trilogy by Garth Nix. This trilogy, consisting of the books Sabriel, Lirael, and The Abhorsen, received such high marks on Amazon, by adults and youth alike, that I thought I'd give it a try. I have now read the first in the series, Sabriel, and really enjoyed it. I've begun the 2nd, Lirael, and"
1901,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"This is a re-read, except this time I listened to the audio version (read by Tim Curry). Coming straight off Clariel, the latest in the series (though set earlier in the timeline), I can see that the author has improved - Clariel had me gripped more - but this one is still very good. The characters are, I think, the best part, unless that's the setting. Sabriel has a clear driver for her actions, a task she has to complete that's both important in the larger scheme of things and also personal to"
1902,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"Okay, I'm just going to say it -- male authors who write female protagonists usually do a crap job. They just do! It's not really their fault; I mean, after all, they are men . So, what do they know about the thoughts, motivations, and feelings of the female character? This was actually the main reason that I put off reading this book, despite the many positive recommendations I got from friends who had read it. Well, I finally broke down and read the thing, and here's what I have to say: Wow. I"
1903,Sabriel,Garth Nix,2,"I began this once a few years back and gave up right after Sabriel first meets Mogget. This time around, I was determined that I would enjoy this book. For one reason, it had such a great reviews that I thought it must be true and two, because I found it boring when I was younger and my taste has changed quite a bit so that now a more tamped down story can hold my interest. But this wasn't just boring. It was dead. That's how the characters felt when I read it. Dead. Non existent. Moving chess pi"
1904,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"I like reading my books with absolutely no expectations. I don't even like to know what they're about, really, I'd much rather rely on the recommendation of a good friend. I need surprise in my stories that much. So, when I picked up Sabriel, I had NO idea of what it would be about, I just knew my friend Tricia put it on my list for the Reading Swap Challenge. Was I ever pleased. Sabriel has spent most of her life at school, learning enough magic that by her 17th year, she is able to perform some"
1905,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"I can't believe this book has been in my life for almost 20 years. It is fresh and evergreen whenever I read it. This book is everything I want in a YA book. Mythos, struggle, humor, a vividly realized world, and the hero grows up. You might not expect a book about a teenage necromancer to be about the appropriate time to die, but this is about death and life being part of a continuum, and the Abhorsen is the necromancer of keeping things orderly. The world and writing in this book are vivid and e"
1906,Sabriel,Garth Nix,2,"I've only heard good things about the trilogy and I've gotten the impression that it was a must for fantasy lovers. Here's the summary: ""Sabriel, daughter of the necromancer Abhorsen, must journey into the mysterious and magical Old Kingdom to rescue her father from the Land of the Dead."" Nah. I wasn't impressed. At the most, it was okay. I just couldn't get into it. I would find myself unconciously skimming it before reminding myself that I was supposed to be paying attention. I guess the fantas"
1907,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"I think I'm going to keep the rating of 4 stars, though I might need to stew a little on it. Maybe 3.5. Sabriel is a great fantasy story, one which I read previously and still wish I read when I was even younger. Sabriel is a story of a girl with a great/unique destiny whose father had to keep in ignorance for safety reasons as well as preserving the bloodline. But now that the evil has been unleashed, Sabriel has been thrust into a world of the dead without much preparation and little training."
1908,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,i can't decide if this book was a 4.5 or a 5 star read for me. i'm so bad at deciding these things sometimes! the characters and the world is so beautifully written and explored and honestly i'm hoping for more of both in the next books in the series (yes i will 100% be continuing on with this series and i am excited to do so)
1909,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"I remember reading SABRIEL for the first time during a baseball game and being utterly enthralled. (My family enjoyed going to baseball games. Me, less so. Thus I always went equipped with a purse full of books.) Almost the next day, I went out and bought LIRAEL. Unfortunately, ABHORSEN wasn't out yet. When it came out I bought it in hardcover, which I almost never do. That's how good the trilogy is. Sabriel is a necromancer, using her bells to prevent the Dead who won't stay dead from running am"
1910,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"I had a lot people recommend this book, but I was pretty disappointed with it. The world Garth Nix constructed was pretty interesting - I can certainly get behind good guy necromancers who wield bells to patrol the gates of Death. Sure. Why not? But did no one tell the author that characters should have personalities?! Oy. Sabriel was so freaking bland. And so was Touchstone and every body else. The only character with any defining character traits was Mogget and his cat-like (cat-induced?) disd"
1911,Sabriel,Garth Nix,1,"Frustrating. Sure, necromancy is interesting but bad writing isn't. I felt like I was thrown unceremoniously in the thick of things expected to accept everything the author dishes out. The challenge for fantasy writers is and has always been creating a whole new universe with its own system, at times convincing the reader that he just missed his own Hogwarts letter in his 11th birthday. Unfortunately, details for Nix mostly meant describing the changing colors of the sunset when a character look"
1912,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"So... happy surprise of all happy surprises... Tim Curry (Clue, Rocker Horror Picture Show, etc - love him) was the narrator of this audiobook! So that was wonderful and obviously he did a great job, but this book would have been great even with a less distinguished narrator. This is one of those books where they don't really do all that much world building, they just sorta throw you in and explain things along the way. For the most part I appreciate that, although there were a few things that t"
1913,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"I have read many fantasy books and I can say with certainty that this is one of those stories that stand out. Sabriel is a very unique, interesting, complex story. Like many other fantasy books, it takes a little time to understand what is going on and really get into the story, but when that happens, you will most likely take a deep breath, dive in and refuse to come out before the end. Sabriel is a young girl but she is an adult inside. A strong female character is a gem! She is not annoying o"
1914,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,"Oops, have to switch to the new ""fiery pretzel"" edition (although the original cover is so much better), and thank you G for that charming observation. As for Becker's contention that this new cover is trying to make the book more appealing to Hunger Games fans, yes, that makes a lot of sense since the fiery pretzel is reminiscent of the mockingjay pin yet comes up not at all in the book, but man oh man, this has nothing in common with THG. I didn't fall over at the end of the book, nor did my he"
1915,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"This book pretty much wowed me. I just started to really get into fantasy books last year, and I have not read a lot of them yet. However this one floored me!!! I was impressed with the whole story. I loved how it started off with her everyday life, and them moved on to her trying to find her dad in death. The adventures that she went on were just amazing ( as well as the friends she had made). The world that she was in was described almost to the Tee. You could picture everything so clearly ( f"
1916,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,"Opens with a prologue wherein a man has to save his newborn daughter from death -- and a necromancer. And then to the girl herself, about to graduate from school on the other side of the Wall, out of the Old Kingdom and where the magic is weaker (though strong enough . She is considering what to do after when a dark shadow appears -- carrying a sack. It came from her father. It brings the sword and the bells, all magical, he uses in his role as the Abhorsen, to combat necromancers and the Dead."
1918,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"That was f-cking awesome. Originally written in the 90s, Nix's Old Kingdom series recently was republished as ebooks. And last week I happened to be browsing my library when I came upon Sabriel . The blurb looked interesting so I picked it up and boy am I glad I got the chance to read it. Sabriel is a solid series starter. The Old Kingdom setting with its hell creatures, curses and myths reminds me of the Demonata series by Darren Shan that I read as a teenager, and reading this story with some sim"
1919,Sabriel,Garth Nix,1,"Generic fantasy plot. So generic, I found myself staring at the kindle progress bar on every other page turn. It tries to pack many popular fantasy plot devices in and creates a hodgepodge of slow paced adventure, uninteresting characters and no real direction. That's the main thing missing for me. There's no clear purpose for the journey, it's more of a companion gathering phase followed by a solving the problem phase. The ""rules"" of the fantasy world's magic are introduced at awkward times and"
1920,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"Okay, forget almost everything that you know about necromancers, because ""Sabriel"" does away with most of the conventions, such as: -Sabriel is a young woman, not a decrepit creepo old guy -her familiar (if it can be called such) is not a raven or a talking skeleton -she uses bells to communicate with the dead (and sometimes her blood, so that's closer to the lore) Zombies are still zombies. Still, I really enjoy Nix's writing--it's descriptive enough without going into Tolkien-esque levels, and work"
1921,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,"2.5 stars This was an okay story, but I did get bored in places. Sabriel was an okay character, but it was a shame she hadn't learned more about what it meant to be an Abhorsen before she became one. She did seem a bit naive in that respect, but it was purely through a lack of education. The storyline was okay, but I got bored. I often have problems with fantasy books, and this one just lost me. The pace was too slow, and I just lost interest. I actually keep wishing that the end would come quicker"
1922,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,3.5 stars I enjoyed reading most of the book. Some parts were rather dull and I felt my interest waning at those parts. I really liked the necromancy and magic aspect. The supposed romance happened way too quickly.(insta love again) The person was too old for the main character 0.0 The main character was a good character. She is strong and intelligent which are qualities I really like in MCs. She is also very selfless. I loved the father-daughter relationship too. I guess the only setback this bo
1923,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,"For someone who doesn't read a lot of fantasy, I was completely taken by this book. It took me a little time to understand the world and how it worked, but I was so taken by Sabriel and her role as Abhorsen that I just couldn't put the book down. And then when we meet Mogget, the most awesome cat sidekick I think I've encountered in fiction so far (and so very, very CAT) I was hooked. Although the romance at the end was a bit contrived and made me cringe a tiny bit, I don't think it detracted fr"
1924,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"I had tried to read this book multiple times in the past and had basically given up, but I finally realised that I was attempting to read it the wrong way; I was trying to read The Silmarillion like I have read and reread LOTR, as a story, an epic story of course, but still a story. Now, while The Silmarillion is of course partially a story, it is (at least for me) first and foremost a religious type document, a biblical, mythological account of the Elder Days of Middle Earth. So this time, I re"

The book was no where to be found on his dumb litt
1926,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,Writing a review of the Silmarillion is like trying to review the Bible. Where do you even start? There’s just so much story in here. Any attempt to convey it in a review would be to do the book a massive disservice. There would only ever be enough space to talk about one or a few elements of the work. So instead I thought I’d give my reasoning as to why every Tolkien enthusiast needs to read this in order to fully understand Tolkien: the sheer depth of the work. “It is said by the Eldar that in

In the end, after having finished reading it for the second time, I realised that I should at least throw out my thoughts on it.

I do not believe it is the best book ever written, even though I know others think"

This book was just a delight to read, from start to finish. The fact that a single man was able to create a fictional world with so much detail absolutely blows my mind. You can feel the love Tolkien had for Middle-earth in every word he writes. The way everything comes together makes it hard to believe that all of this is truly just fictional. There is so"

1937,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,"The Silmarillion is difficult to read and I don't think it is even meant to be read straight through like a novel. Another reviewer put it best when he said ""The Silmarillion is like the Bible, it's the Bible of Middle Earth"". It's the magical setting of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings and it tells the history of the place, the inhabitants, the languages, and the legends that came before Bilbo and Frodo. For you Ring fanatics, you haven't finished the story until you've read the history."

It's been compared to the Old Testament, and that's still the best analogy; if you think that Moses leading his people out of Egypt is the stuff of grand drama, then this is the book for you, Tolkien fan or not. If you don't, then you probably ought to give The Silmarillion a pass, no matter how much you liked Tolkien's other work. This is not Lord of the Rings Plus; it's quite literally the Old"

This books was not written to make readers like an specific plot twist or character. No! This book is solely the recompilation of various tales that happened in the world where The Lord of the Rings was settled in, from the beautifully written Ainülindale and the creation of Eä, to the end of the Third Age and the Fading Years. That being said, you'll understand that it's not odd at all to find chapters"
1940,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"In my humble opinion, The Silmarillion is the greatest work Tolkien almost finished. It is by far more difficult to read than The Lord of the Rings (which I already expressed my love for earlier in the year after completing my re-read) or The Hobbit but its greatness is found in the way it mixes together epic fantasy, mythology and linguistics to create a grand tale of creation and destruction. Part of what I love so much about Tolkien's entire Middle Earth story is that there is a cycle as to ho"

I knew the basic themes long before I started the book, and after “The Lord of the Rings” I also knew that “The Silmarillion” would be what I had been waiting for. The concept was not only radically new in its time, but is still unique in any given time-frame: a made-up cosmogony and mythology (well, it always is) of a made-up world, inhabited of made-up peoples, made-up history, made-up languages etc. Ev"

It can be, admittedly, a little bit dry at times and I definitely enjoy certain chapters/stories more than others, but... I adore the world, so it's always a fairly enjoyable read tbh. I picked up on things that I missed the last time I read it - it's just a little bit lore heavy, so that's understandable. Also just about everyone has at least 2-3 name"

NOTE: This book is the prequel to the Hobbit-LOTR books, and if you haven't yet read those two, the ending of this book has spoilers for both.

Tolkien,4,"To be honest, I don't think I ever made it through the entire book. *gasp* But I'm a Tolkien fan and I had this crazy LOTR obsession when the movies were released that I never really got over. So yeah, this book was still a win. It's really dense, but it's so full of fascinating back story. It's like the Bible of Middle Earth. It's got all the good legends, like the story of Morgoth, and of Beren and Luthien, but it's got troves of other info as well so this is a must for any die-hard Tolkien fan."
1960,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"Sil remains my all-time favorite story. Many find it dry and antiquated. I understand what they are saying, but I see it in the light of being Tolkien's true treasure-trove without any of the ""bridge-building anachronisms"" of LotR. This is the core mythology of his creation, and it generates the truest feeling of the Faerie Realm above all others. [Note- for those who are set to read it for the first time, I encourage you to get Children of Hurin and hold onto it. Sil covers the tales of Hurin/T"
1961,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"A lot of people complain about the complexity of this book, but I think they just need to grow up and/or learn how to read more effectively. I found it to be one of the best books I have ever read. The back story it provided to the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit books was highly entertaining, and the style of writing was so beautiful it could have been poetry. I highly recommend it to anyone that can take something a little more complex, but if you are a less advanced reader you might want to st"
1962,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,"As I've just finished listening to the audiobook version of The Silmarillion , I thought to take this opportunity to review this volume of Tolkien's posthumously published works (which I first read 30 years ago). I'll be posting this review here and with the hardcopy version of the book. First off, specific to the audiobook: Martin Shaw does an excellent job of reading. The only quibble I have is the opening and closing musical interludes, which seem superfluous and don't really add anything to th"
1963,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,"Note, July 1, 2014: I edited this review just now to correct a typo; I'd written ""Gondor"" when I meant ""Gondolin"" in one place. (Pretty big geographical and chronological difference, despite the similar spellings!) For once, the Goodreads description of this book, and the breakdown of its constituent parts, is quite accurate. It may not sufficiently convey the fact, though, that what Tolkien wrote in an array of handwritten notebooks, going back as far as 1917, while it lays out the basic back-st"
1965,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,3,"The Silmarillion reads like a foreign language history book. In the modern sense, it is plotless. There is no single narrative with a main character to fall in love with or a satisfying conclusion. This is the history of Middle Earth. You've been warned. Therefore this is easily argued as being for hardcore Tolkien fans only. If you are absolutely in love with the world the author created and wish to immerse yourself entirely in it, put everything down and read The Silmarillion ! All others shoul"
1967,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"I’m somewhat dubious of my ability to review this work, but I’m going to do my best. _The Silmarillion_ is the work of Tolkien’s most often viewed with apprehension by readers and, I think, the one most unjustly maligned. It has the reputation of being the most difficult of his published works and I guess this is not without reason, though I think it is often a position based more on preconceptions than due to the inherent value of the work itself. I’ve read _The Silmarillion_ many times prior t"

I love this book, I love it so much it's hard to express HOW MUCH I love it. This book takes me away to another place and time, it's part of me, I don't think a week passes without me thinking about it. I constantly want to open it and read it. It combines e"
1970,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"The Silmarillion is one of those books that I’ve meant to read for years, literally. It is, according to some, the book that separates casual Lord of the Rings fans from truly hard-core Tolkien lovers. My first girlfriend confessed to preferring the Silmarillion over the Lord of the Rings , which she was unable to finish. [info:]murpheyslaw likewise holds that the Silmarillion is the preferable work, being more true to Tolkien’s desire to create an epic that the Lord of the Rings is. Or something"

1973,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,"Let me start off by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed my overall experience with The Silmarillion. So, you might ask, why not give it a perfect rating? Hopefully, I can explain that in the rest of this review. The Silmarillion is a beautifully written book. It is actually a collection of several works of J.R.R. Tolkien edited and combined into one book by his son, Christopher, and published posthumously. The five works combined in this book are Ainulindale, Valaquenta, Quenta Silmarillion, Akallab"
1975,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"This book was spectacular. It's not the kind of book that you sit down with and read for fun and escape, but the kind of book that you read when you want something deep with fascinating world building and wonderful writing. It reads very much like scripture, which I loved . That said, it requires a different kind of reading than a fast paced fantasy that spans a shorter amount of time. I can tell you right now that I did not keep all of the named characters and events and places straight in my he"
1976,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,"I first read The Silmarillion when I was young and foolish -- well, perhaps not, but definitely young and unprepared for it. I come back armed with a better knowledge of how to approach it. It isn't a story in the same way as The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings are. It's closer to the myths that so fascinated Tolkien, closer to Norse sagas and the Old English Beowulf. It helped to see it in that way, to approach it in the same way as I would a Norse saga -- and I can't help but think that Tolkien w"
1977,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,2,"Oh God...Finishing this required strenuous effort. Sorry but I didn't enjoy this book.. It just wasn't what I expected. I can totally understand why Silmarillion is a favourite to others, though. Tolkien is the master of fantasy after all. Contrary to The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, Silmarillion is something like an account of all the events during the 1st, 2nd and 3rd age (LOTR describes the events taking place during the last 2 decades of the 3rd age). Using a goodreads friend's remark this b"
1980,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"Tolkien thought this was his greatest work, and I agree. In it he develops not characters but millennia of history and an entire cosmology as well as some very touch individual stories (love stories really). The Simmarillion is really an acquired taste, but so worth the effort and so deep."
1981,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"A must read for any Tolkien fan. This one lays out the foundations of Tolkien's amazing world. Here are a few thougths on Tolkien's theory and purposes. When Owen Barfield read poetry, he would at times come across a passage which would impress him very strongly. It would cause what he called a “felt change of consciousness”. As he began to make an in depth inquiry into this phenomenon, it grew into an epistomology: a theory of knowledge, and meaning. Barfield was a member of the inklings and a"
1982,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"Wow, I really enjoyed this book :) That's all I can say (then again, it really isn't a surprise since I'm such a history nerd, even a fictional history nerd). RW Ratings: Language: 5 stars. Obviously, since it IS Tolkien. Abuse: 4 1/2 stars. There is some strained relationships between families due to...umm...drama. Like war drama. Lust: 4 stars. I say this mainly for the Children of Hurin section. In case you are not familiar with that story - the main plot revolves around this guy that has a y"
1983,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,"This is a good book, offering a lot of insight regarding the history of Middle-Earth, and how the circumstances of the Hobbit came to be. I definitely recommend it for fans of The Lord of the Rings. However, some parts can be a little tedious, and there are many character names introduced at once which I found confusing. If I read it multiple times I think I would be able to follow the story better and get to truly appreciate the piece of literature."
1984,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"There are no words for this book. It isn’t The Lord of the Rings because it isn’t in that category. Think D'Aulaires' Book of Greek Myths or rather The Greek Myths , by Graves because Tolkien doesn’t go lite as D’Aulaire does. But this isn’t exactly a book of mythology either. It’s a compilation and an unfinished one at that, but what is there is epic and legendary and – I recently learned – soon to be made into a movie(s) . But as pleased as I am to learn there is to be a movie(s), I know it/they"
1985,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,3,"3.5 stars Reading this volume had the same feel for me as reading the Old Testament—it is the background material for a whole system of thought. I guess that reveals my religious leanings—Middle Earth is where I hope my spirit goes when I die. But seriously, reading this historical background document to Middle Earth reminded me very much of a summer when I was a teenager when I decided to read through the whole Bible, with the thought that if I could understand the whole thing I might find somet"
1986,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"A summary of this book would pale in comparison to what actually happens, but I'll try my hand nonetheless. These are the events that happened long ago in the history of Elves and Men. Before a Hobbit found a ring. Before a Fellowship was formed. Before a journey was made. These are the stories of the creation of Middle Earth, the gods and goddesses (the Valar) of this world, the beginnings of the Elves and their glory days. Here in these pages reside stories of lust and greed, of bravery and en"
1987,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,"This is not The Lord of the Rings . It isn't even in the same genre, and the difference is greater than with The Hobbit (and in the other direction). Though I will note that reading it will transforming a re-reading of The Lord of the Rings . A saga of the beginning of the world, and the heroes and tragedies of the First Age of the World. Many of them. In places the style is distinctly summary. (Oddly enough, reading the partial versions, as in Beren and Lúthien , underscores it when I compare the mo"
1988,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"Where to begin? This book was completely and utterly fabulous. I absolutely love this book. It stuns me with its awesomeness. Something I really love about this book is how it is written using very archaic language. It gives the story a feeling of legend, and reminds me of an old history. It adds a realism to it, makes it seem like more than just fantasy. And to add to the reality of the story, it isn't all fun and fluff and glorious victories and blazes of glories and happy endings (view spoile"
1990,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,This review will contain lots of fanart so be warned and some spoilers! It took me a very long time to try and write a review for The Silmarillion . You can certainly compare it to writing a review about the Bible because both books basically have the same concepts. If you are a Tolkien fan who only enjoyed The Lord of the Rings then this isn't the book for you. This is a very dry read because the Silmarillion is about the creation of Middle-Earth and the First Age. This isn't something that you
1993,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,"This book is huge in its narrative scope. The only book I’ve ever read that is huger is the Bible. And the Silmarillion is written very much like the Bible. It starts before the creation of Arda, and takes the reader through three ages to the end of the War of the Ring. There really isn’t anything like an epic high-fantasy with a really solid Judeo-Christian cosmology. This isn’t a Lewis-style allegory, by any means, but the beauty that shines through the darkness of this story is unmistakable."

1996,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,3,"So this was hard to read in just one sitting. It took me several days to finish with this. Honestly I am glad that I did read this, but it's definitely not a book I would re-read again. There were parts of it that put me right to sleep. I think my favorite section was The Third Age. Tolkien definitely uses The Bible, Greek, and Roman mythology as inspiration for some of the characters and events in ""The Silmarillion."" I got a kick at first going oh this is supposed to be Hades, this is supposed"
1998,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,"I originally read The Silmarillion shortly after it was first published in 1977, and while I remember enjoying it, I don't remember being terribly impressed. Clearly, I am a different reader now than I was then. This is an amazing book on so many levels, and I actually believe that I have read it at just the perfect time in my life. First, I have always enjoyed Tolkien-the-poet, and this extensive mythology that he has created with The Silmarillion just sheds ever so much light on his poetic inf"
1999,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,1,"J. R. R. Tolkien, The Silmarillion (Ballantine, 1977) In the sixties, something changed. Perhaps Mother Church realized that people were turning away from her; perhaps a cadre of teachers decided the younger generation needed to get in touch with its cultural roots; whatever. We ended up with a course in either the religion, literature, or both departments at many universities: The Bible As Literature.

2000,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,"Reader beware - the Silmarillion is not a novel, it's a history textbook. However, if you really love Middle-Earth and MUST HAVE MORE, this is the next book for you. To put it another way: The Silmarillion is prerequisite introductory reading for the aspiring Tolkienologist. If you can't handle it, you had better resign yourself to the more comfortable position of LotR enthusiast. The Silmarillion will make you late for dinner. For comparative perspective: I tried and failed to read the Silmarillion"
2001,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,"For the uninitiated, The Silmarillion is a history book of Tolkien's Middle-Earth, the land in which The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings take place (as well as many other works by Tolkien, most of them unfinished). It's written in a very different style from his more famous works and I think a lot of people are put off by that. I have to say that, as big a Tolkien fan as I am, even I find The Silmarillion a bit dry and repetitive at times. For anybody who loves The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rin"
2005,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,3,"This is one of those books that I'm sort of surprised I never read sooner. Like back in the day when I was reading The Lord of the Rings , or later when I went to see the movies in the theater (multiple times), or even later when I owned the movies (both the fancy extended versions and the regular versions, viewed multiple times). I think Tolkien did alright for himself, but my experience with his writing has gone only so far as The Lord of the Rings. Then again, I'm not a huge reader of fantasy,"
2007,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"Loved this epic work, but let me put it in perspective: ""The Hobbit"" is for children, ""The Lord of the Rings"" is for adults, and ""The Silmarillion"" is for scholars."
2009,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"Een (erg) uitgebreide Nederlandse review vind je hier! Ahh I loved this so much! It is not as easy to read as the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, because there are a lot of characters and places with names similar to eachother. I would mix up names when I was reading it for too long, and I didn't want to miss anything, so I read a few chapters each day instead of reading it for hours. That worked great for me. The story I loved the most was the one 'of Beren and Luthien', I could read a whole boo"
2010,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,"Unlike The Hobbit or The Lord of the Rings , the Silmarillion is not a typical fantasy story. Covering thousands of years, the Silmarillion tells the story of Tolkien’s universe from its creation to the end of The Return of the King . This is both the history and the mythology behind Middle Earth, told in a high (or baroque) style that will endear it to some readers, while putting others to sleep. The trick to the Silmarillion is to approach it as the author intended. If you're looking for a novel"

Tolkien 's Lord of the Rings in 1976 and have prized it above all since then, yet I didn't finish reading the Silmarillion until 2007, 30 years after having received the first edition as a gift from my freshman English professor.

2012,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,3,"If you're planning on reading The Silmarillion, you must first understand what it is you're about to tackle. It is not a novel. It is the basis for novels (namely The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit ). It is the telling of the creation and forming of the lands of middle earth. It is written in such a way that had Tolkien claimed to have found and translated it from a long lost ancient text, some would have believed him. You have to understand...Tolkien didn't write this book for the reader. He wr"
2014,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"Now this is my favourite book by Tolkien. LOTR is incredible, but in my opinion, the war of the ring just doesn't hold up to the stories inside The Silmarillion . The heroes inside these pages are so much more mythic, audacious and awe-inspiring than those of the latter age. In the grand scheme of Tolkien's regime, this IS Middle Earth. Basically, what LOTR did for me for reading in general, this book did the same for the fantasy genre. This is the book that really opened my eyes to not only the f"

I'm guessing it's not a light read even if English IS your first language, since it's written in a very archaic style. Even LOTR was piece of cake with its not so modern language comparing with this one. But once you get over the language barrier, if there's one, you find yourself immersed into the mythology of Middle Earth and you NEVER want it to end. Or it's just crazy o"

This is not a novel; best to approach it as an encyclopaedic history of the fictional Middle Earth. It chronicles the elder days from the creation of Tolkien's fantastic universe to the fall of the old Elven kingdoms and the wars over and eventual loss of the Silmarills. While The Children of Húrin reads like a recorded legend, The Silmarillion is similarly atypical in approach—taking a detached, factual tone. Ther"
2023,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"9/18: It appears I am through one-third. The book is dense, and its nature is to make one want to pay as close attention as is possible. So far, I am impressed with the skill for continuance and weaving Tolkien possesses here. It is indeed something for those lovers of fantasy, or myth, or high olden language, but it does in fact reveal characters to whom the reader may attach and not realize it until the story turns in some unforeseen emotional way. The intricacy with which Tolkien also gives p"
2024,The Silmarillion,J.R.R.

Filled with lots of tales of heroism, betrayal, battles, and the stuff of many the Eldar lore and legend."

2038,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,"Always wanted to read The Silmarillion , but can't seem to make it through? Read on. A large part of the romance and epic feel of The Lord of the Rings is the sense that you are embedded in a larger story, of which the current saga is only a part. This feeling shows itself in many parts of the story, with Aragorn singing fragments of songs of the Elder Days, Frodo calling out Aiya Eärendil Elenion Ancalima! as he faces Shelob, and various references to the revered West, among many other examples,"

Tolkien,5,"5 stars Full review in Indonesian can be read here: I will re-read this book after I finished Lords of The Ring (yes, still can't manage to finish it XD) because The Silmarillion deserved a re-read. Tolkien is genius, crazy genius...no wonder if his works will always be roots for many fantasy books. And if I can, I really want to take one of his classes, learn Middle Earth history and try to be elves by learning Sindarin and Quenya languange XD"
2049,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"Tolkein is the father of all post 20th century epic high fantasy written. There is not one writer who can out master him. ITs not because there have not been other good writers because there are many many good ones. But some have a gift, a real epic rare gift. Tolkein had that gift. A gift of imagination quiet un-parallel to any other epic high fantasy writer. Lord of the rings is one of the most renowned books but this book gives the history and background which puts everything in a perspective"
2050,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"Sometimes, people ask me if I have managed to make it through The Silmarillion. I always feel a little embarrassed that the answer isn't so much “Yes” as it is “Multiple times, and I'm so looking forward to the next round.” Full review at my blog, In Which I Read Vintage Novels"
2053,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"This might well be the last book I hold before I die When I'm sundered from this world underneath my pillow it will lie Bury me not with it, but pass on its lore, and then come find me again in the land of Valinor."
2057,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,"4-4.5, I think? Read almost like a bible at times, but I think that was the point. Really enjoyed it though!"
2059,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,I specifically loved the Story of Beren and Luthien and of Turin Turambar :')
2060,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,2,"An odd, sometimes compelling, and rather inscrutable background to Tolkien's Middle-earth world. It's not really clear what this book is about. In many ways, it's a history of the world; in other ways, it's a history of the attempts to defeat Morgoth, the original Dark Lord; it's a history of the elves; it's a history of the Silmarils. It is tempting to say that this book is not the story of anything in particular but is just a collection of different stories, but that's true in just the trivial"
2061,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"“All have their worth and each contributes to the worth of the others.” The Silmarillion can be a tough reading as much as a wonderful one. It reminds us that the greatness, the dedication, the passion and proficiency through which J.R.R. Tolkien built its world comes first of all from his immense talent and love for philology, for words and languages to which he dedicated all his life. From this book and love for words he started to imagine his world; first he built a language, an entire langua"
2062,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"Am I a true Tolkien nerd yet? 🤓 I’m still blown away by how much I loved The Silmarillion. I approached this book with a lot of trepidation as many people write it off as boring or difficult to read, but in fact I think you must just expect not a novel but a history of the Lord of the Rings world so many of us at enamored of. The “biblical” voice bothered me not at all, and in fact rather enjoyed it. It was an extremely condensed history; so MANY novels could have be wrought from this if Tolkien"
2064,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,"If I had to describe this book in one word.... I would kill myself because that would be cruel and impossible. But this was a great book. As with most prequels I'm glad I read The Hobbit , and The Lord of The Rings trilogy before this one. Oh my goodness there were SO MANY CHARACTERS! I can just imagine that meme with Xzibit saying, ""Yo dawg I heard you like characters so I put characters in your characters so you can get really freaking confused."" Okay, maybe that's not how the meme goes, but you"
2065,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,"I read this slowly over a long period of time and also enjoyed listening to the Silmarillion Seminars from the Tolkien Professor while doing so. Little things like understanding the origins of creatures like the balrog, Sauron, the Wizards, dwarves and so forth added a lot to my enjoyment and understanding of LOTR. It does come off like Old Testament fan fiction but I found the history of the Elves and the Valar enriching and entertaining."
2066,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"I am going to attempt to write a review for one of the best books I have ever read, and it is daunting. But then so was reading it. I read 'The Silmarillion' eleven years after I had read 'The Lord of the Rings. One advantage was that I went into it with a fair knowledge of and love for Tolkien's style, so I knew I was not going to give up after reading a few pages as I had initially done with 'The Lord of the Rings'. But it had been far too long since I read the Lord of the Rings, and in the int"
2068,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,"Watch in amazement as I reduce the wordiest and densest novel of Tolkien's to just five words: It's all about that bling. :P Elves and their bling are nearly as bad as a certain dark lord and his bling. But seriously, one of the greatest things about LOTR, and to a lesser extent The Hobbit, is that Middle-Earth is a fully realized world. It feels real because it has depth, it has history, and Tolkien understands how to use language to give the various peoples their own traditions and beliefs and p"
2069,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"(English isn't my first language, so please excuse any mistakes) The Silmarillion is the story of the First Age of the world, concerning mostly the elves and the Valar (gods of sorts). The ""preface"" (how the earth was made by the gods) is actually a different text, but Christopher Tolkien saw it fit to be included in this edition of The Silmarillion, since it explains everything since the very beginning. This (and the Valanqueta- the description of the gods) was a bit tough for me to read, since"
2070,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"The is one of the most unique and THE most difficult-to-explain book I have read recently. I loved the book, but it's after many tries of finding the best way to read it. This is what the readers should do: If you can consider The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings are real legends; then think this as the non-fiction source to those legends which is discovered (by you) after learning the legends. One must read this like we read the Bible or the History books. And why wouldn't anyone dislike either"
2071,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"I have read this book at least 6 times. I had been avoiding it since it came out in 1977. I always really wished Tolkien had written more. But, I could not get into this particular book. About 15 or 10 years ago I started reading Tolkien criticism. Particularly Verlyn Flieger's ""Splintered Light"" and John Garth's ""Tolkien and the Great War"" which warmed me to ""The Silmarillion"". About 6 years ago I listened to ""The Silmarillion"" as an audio book while I was working on a long stained-glass project"
2072,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"This is by far my favorite Tolkien book. I still find the atmosphere of Middle Earth fascinating in some way, and I don’t think this happens often to me for things I loved when I was a kid. I suppose this is simply my “comfort reading.” One thing that was cool is that in the First and Second Ages elves and men lived on the same earth as their gods, only separated by a sea. These gods were tangibly real, some of them even marrying elves and spawning a progeny. So for once it isn't a matter of beli"
2073,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,1,"I feel almost blasphemous giving this book a bad rating, but I seriously did not enjoy it. Tolkien did a great job crafting a mythology for his fantasy world, but he did a horrible job creating characters. This reads like a history book or a compilation of legends rather than a fantasy novel. Characters come and go with such frequency that there is not time for development. There were several shorter sub-stories that could have been expanded to be novels of their own, but zooming through at the p"
2075,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,3,"I have no idea how to rate this book. I feel like I have a split personality regarding it. On the one hand... Tolkien is a freaking genius. His stories, his worlds, his way with words are all astounding!!! They're so rich and original and just good!!! If I were rating the stories, the plots, The Silmarillion would get hands down 5 stars no questions asked. On the other hand... It's flipping hard to read. The characters have such similar names and they change their names so often it's really reall"
2076,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"It doesn't matter how many times I read this book, I love it every time. This is the story of the world of Middle Earth long before the forging of the One Ring. It contains the history of the Valar and of the Elves along with the war for the Silmarils. It is their history of the beginings of their world and the powers that be. It contains triumphs and sorrows and deeds of valor. Later story tell of the coming of Men and how they aided the Eldar in their war against Morgoth. It also tells of grea"
2077,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,This book is not for everyone. But it is most certainly for me. I used to go back and forth on whether I liked this more than The Lord of the Rings . Usually it just had to do with which of them I was reading at the time. So I gave up trying to rate them against each other. So many great stories that hit you in the gut or blind you with splendor. I wish I could paint with words to a tenth of Tolkien's ability. Most recent read: It still amazes me... Every time I read it it is better than I rememb
2079,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"J. R. R. Tolkien was a genius and there is no doubt whatsoever about it. His worldbuilding skills were phenomenal, as was his imagination. And what is most surprising is that even his books on the fictional history of Middle-earth are read with avid attention. I'm sure I didn't pay that much attention even to real history. And may I just draw your attention to his writing- it's so beautiful, powerful and moving."
2082,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,2,"I didn't like this book,but that's basically my own fault,considering I don't like Tolkien's style of writing but decide to try anyway. I can't give one single star because Tolkien is great at world building but as for the rest...meh."
2083,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,"A wonderful book I only drop it to 4 stars as it's a little (or quite a bit) harder to follow than the trilogy. Follow the Tolkien background to the stories we ""all"" know. A version of the creation story and the history of the pre-history to the War of the Ring."
2085,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,Wonderful! Simply wonderful! Read at a slow pace so you can digest everything. Will lead you to loving The Lord of the Rings even more.
2086,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,I cried.
2088,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,3,Ever wanted to read a history textbook all the way through? Ever want to read a history textbook containing no information pertinent to the real world? Then this book is for you!

2091,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,"As I've just finished listening to the audiobook version of The Silmarillion , I thought to take this opportunity to review this volume of Tolkien's posthumously published works (which I first read 30 years ago). I'll be posting this review here and with the hardcopy version of the book. First off, specific to the audiobook: Martin Shaw does an excellent job of reading. The only quibble I have is the opening and closing musical interludes, which seem superfluous and don't really add anything to th"
2092,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"I think it almost goes without saying. But yep. I loved The Silmarillion. Tolkien's dedication to world building, his eye for beauty (at least at three levels: physical, relational, and theological), his grasp of how good stories work, and his simple wisdom about creature-nature all work together to make this one of the best books I have ever read. I know, I know. It's not The Hobbit. It doesn't read quickly. But there are books worth reading slowly, and this is one of them. I would suggest find"
2093,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,"So, I'm finally done. This book is amazing, but since it's a story collection and there is a lot of repetition and infodumping, it's so hard to keep up with. So it was fun and entertaining, but also at times I was just like ""okay, thanks for the geographical lesson. I still have no idea what you're talking about."" Some things I learned: -Tolkien is such a nerd. I mean I knew that, but being a nerd myself I could recognize themes and his places of inspiration and it's just great. -every modern fa"
2094,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"After reading the ""Lord of the Rings (LOR)"" in original english, I thought it could be not more difficult to read another J.R.R.Tolkien book. But I was wrong. As a native german speaker, it took me month to read the ""LOR"". For the Silmarillion it took me nearly the same amount of time. There are very few pages comparing to the LOR, but to understand all implications, all connections, all names you Need time. I started three times anew and read the full book, calculating all double readings of page"
2095,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"How do you even begin to review something like The Silmarillion ? It's an epic in every sense of the word, a religious text that explores the lore of Middle Earth in a way few fantasies have dared to match. Tolkien is the original grandmaster of the fantasy genre and in this collection of stories he brings to the table some of his finest work. As a huge Lord of the Rings fan it was impossible not to love this book. Exploring history beyond that of the War of the Ring, The Silmarillion doesn't hold"
2096,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,2,"Mother... it is over... I've finished... the evil has been defeated... As a fantasy fan it seems lacking that I've never read a Tolkien work. I attempted to, in middle high school, but I could only get my hands on the French version of ""The Two Towers"" and my French was very lacking then. I think I didn't even make it through the first 100 pages. After that painful defeat I never attempted any book of Tolkien's again, especially since I liked the movies enough but... am not passionate about them."
2097,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,3,"Thank Iluvator I actually found Tolkien's books in the order that they were published, if this was the first book I'd read I might never have read the Hobbit or LOTR. This was a reread for me, so I opted for the audio book. The narrator Martin Shaw was very good and brought a storyteller like quality to the experience, which for me was perfect for this book. I'm going to give it a three star rating, I liked it but unlike the 5 stars I gave the Hobbit and LOTR, I didn't love it. When I first read"
2098,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,"It has been a while since I have read anything by Tolkien, but as usual he never disappoints. From the first page of the book he weaved his magic and I was once again transported to Middle Earth. He has such a gift for writing and storytelling you feel like you are there living and breathing the story. No wonder the man is a legend, his imagination knows no bounds from the poetic location names to the wealth and personalities of the characters, especially in this version as I listened to the audi"
2099,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"The Silmarillion is not an easy read, but on the other hand, I don’t want Tolkien fans who might be interested to be unnecessarily scared away from it. I definitely had a rough start the first time I read it, but eventually it won me over. I followed along with The Silmarillion Primer at Tor.com during this reread, and I highly recommend it. It’s intended for first-time readers and does a great job of explaining things, focusing on one chapter at a time. That said, avoid reading the comments at"
2100,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,"The Silmarillion may be the most difficult book I've ever read, and likewise the most difficult review I've ever written. It's incredibly dense and filled with so much information and so many stories that a proper review would be quite long. In essence, it would be like reviewing the Bible, to which The Silmarillion is often compared, and that would certainly be no easy task. Nevertheless, I have tried, and this is the result. I imagine any reader of J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings or The Hobb"
2101,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,3,"First off, I would not have made it through the Silmarillion if I hadn't been doing a chapter-a-day read-along of the Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings through a group on Litsy. A chapter each day was more doable and the fact that I was doing it with others helped when I likely would have decided it was too deep and too much detail for me--so many people and places to sort out, coupled with the unending battles and death of practically any character I could grow to care about. That being said, th"
2102,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"I loved this book and probably is one of my favorite books of all time. The in-depth story telling of Tolkien and the beautiful threads that he weaves through it blew me away. The start of the book is a but slow, I will agree, however once it starts to pick up it is fantastic! The story of Beren and Lúthien is worth the read alone, and couple that with everything else... utterly amazing. Definitely worth the money to buy it and I would contend that the stories of middle-earth will become classic"
2103,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,"Good stuff here by the Tolkien's. Only reason for a 4 star rather than 5 was that the genealogical nonsense up front got to be a bit much for me. However, I feel like this was a well developed higher view of middle earth and the world around it. Giving life to epic struggles hinted at in the Lord of the Rings books/movie, and delving much deeper into history before that. Many of these stories could be further developed and expanded upon in novel or movie form."
2104,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"After 17 months I finally finished this book. It was a long way to finish one book, but it was worth it and it wasn't even that long if I compare my effort to get my hand on it in the first place. I first knew about the Silmarillion after finished LoTR in 2002, yes it means that I'm one of Tolkien fans because of the movies by Peter Jackson. At that time, I never read any books in English and knowing Tolkien writing in both LoTR and The Hobbit, I wasn't confident enough to read it in English. And"
2105,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,"I feel like a hero after having read this book! It's absolutely genius that he has come up with such detailed world, history of this world and all its characters. However, it felt like Tolkien needed to write 3 books for each Epoch because it was too many facts and stories for one short book and I felt overwhelmed and sometimes bored."
2106,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"I was always told the silmarillion was dreadfully boring and could only be read with great perseverance. This couldn't be more wrong! I really loved to read all the lore of Middle-Earth, from its creation to the departure of the elves from it. Although all tales are summarised mostly, the epicness seeps from it. A must read for anyone interested in ME lore."
2108,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,You have to be concentrated on every single page but it's totally worth it.
2109,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"There aren't really words fantastic enough to describe the Silmarillion, Tolkien is the God of fantasy and this book is his Bible."
2110,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,Such an amazing story (stories!) that lift the word 'epic' to a whole new level. Makes the (brilliant) Lord of the Rings seem like just one minor episode in Middle Earth's grand narrative. Interspersed reading this one with listening to the unabridged audiobook read by Martin Shaw which definitely added to my enjoyment of it this time around.

2113,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"The Silmarillion is where it all began before the creation of the Middle-Earth that we know and love in 'the lord of the rings' this is where JRR Tolkien gained all of his inspiration & ideas for the construction of the 2nd age and 3rd ages of Middle-earth and it explains how throughout history it came into being. It is the story of the first age of Tolkien's world of ancient drama where it all begins and some characters that reader of LOTR are familiar with, like Elrond & Galdriel appea"
2115,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,"There's no getting around the fact that The Silmarillion is a difficult book. The first time I tried it after reading The Lord of the Rings, I was completely flummoxed. That's because unlike Tolkien's other epic fantasy works, The Silmarillion isn't really a novel in the usual sense of the word. There's no character dialogue, and events are not recounted in a ""blow by blow"" retelling, so there's no sense of immediacy and no easy hook to immerse yourself in it. I really ""got"" The Silmarillion once"
2117,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"I've been avoiding this book for years, convinced I wasn't up to the challenge of the dense mythology of Tolkien's world and the unmanageable thicket of Elven names and lineages but I was taken completely by surprise by the fact that the most difficult aspect of reading this book was also what made it so worthwhile, and that is how deeply sad it is. The efforts of Elves and men to keep evil at bay are so moving not because they fight with such courage but because the outcome is so often tragic."
2118,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"Wow! Tolkien sure knows how to put the ""story"" in HISTORY! THE SILMARILLION is a prequel of epic proportions, going way, way, WAY back in time to tell the tale of the very formation of Middle-earth and its peoples, Middle-earth's very history! While THE SIMARILLION can't really be compared to THE HOBBIT or the LotR books, it certainly is awesome in its own right, and I would definitely recommend lovers of LotR to pick up THE SIMARILLION. (Though definitely read THE SIMARILLION after the latter wo"
2119,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"This vast history of Middle Earth is an ambitious volume that attempts to compile the notes of J.R.R. Tolkien in a mythic and elegant form. The language is poetic, written in a style similar to the old Icelandic Edda, the Silmarillion contains none of the comforts of the modern novel (no point of view characters and very few prose devices). Rather, the narrative is sprawling, ambitious and written in high language. It is, possibly, for this reason, that many readers of fantasy forgo this tome in"
2121,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"Once I wrote a review of The Silmarillion in my head. I'll probably always do that. It is a perfect book. There are not many perfect books. It makes me understand the term ""divine inspiration."" It has the ring of truth. To make such a perfect work, which transcends art or myth-making, an author was needed who spent all his life paying attention to how people make stories and what makes a story important. It needed a writer who never ceased listening and learning. The Silmarillion had to be done"
2122,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"An absolutely amazing book, the best and most fascinating treatment of predetermination and freewill in a work of fiction I know of. Tolkien incorporates many mythological stories and influences in his story and comes up with a rich narrative that begs close study. Corey Olsen's Silmarillion Seminars published on his Tolkien Professor podcast ( http://tolkienprofessor.com/lectures/... ) have been invaluable to me.

It's definitely for the more determined and nerd-like Tolkien fan, as it's much less of a narrative than The Lord of the Rings (which is unsurprising, seeing as it wasn't really meant for publication as such). One of the things I loved is the way one event builds on the ones before it. Sometimes there would be a story or passage, and I would think, ""Yes, that's nice, but why is th"
2127,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"I'm not even going to pretend to be objective about this. I realize the Silmarillion won't be for everyone; it won't be for most people. It is not a novel or a short-story collection -- it's a book of myths and legends of Middle-earth written in a sort of King James biblical prose. The tales range from the creation of the world (and the rebellion of Melkor/Morgoth, of whom Sauron was merely his chief lieutenant) through the rise of the peoples of Middle-earth (Elves, Dwarves and Men) and great Wa"

His voice is as unique as that of Milton, Bierce, Conrad, Blake, Donne, or Eliot, and as fully-realized. I am a hard and critical man, cynical and not easily moved, but there are passages in the Gormenghast series which so shocked me by the force of their beauty that I snap the book shut, overwhelmed with wonderment, and take a moment to catch my breath.

I descend into the fathomless depths of the imagination with author Mervyn Peake. One of the fathers of the modern Fantasy genre, Peake is little known outside literary circles. His masterpiece, The Gormenghast Trilogy, was published around the time of Tolkien’s"
2137,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,"One of the great hermetic works of literature. A complete and total world unto itself, almost to the point of detaching from the Earth and assuming its own orbit. If it were to do this it would be a strangely barren world however, a barren world of endlessly ramifying imagination, an almost airless world, a world both vast and microscopic. These books, this world, induced a tremendous sense of mental claustrophobia in this reader, yet all these years later I still long to return to it."
2138,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,"Don't compare to lord of the rings..compare to Kafka, Poe, Lewis Carroll,or maybe Edward Gorey..a mostly drop dead funny book(or books) that retains a sense of unbearable grimness."

Seventeen years old and awake all night, almost every night, incapable of shutting the mind off for some peace and shut eye. I remember looking down at my instant favorite in my lap not being able to believe my luck to have found such a book. Escape! Mervyn Peake's trilogy are not books that will ease loneliness... What they did give to me were these sets of images that will not leave"
2140,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,"The Gormenghast trilogy is as close to perfection as literature can be. It is unique, sublime, whimsical, moving, weird, surprising, otherworldly, and written in shimmering, velvety, voloptouos prose, wonderful beyond belief. No amount of imagery, sumptuous, voluminous, sensuous or rapturous can even begin to describe the delights of Peake's masterpiece. A true triumph of language and imagination."

Eddison’s in The Worm Ouroboros , both for its fecundity and for the manifest enjoyment in the English language its author feels. Twenty years ago – even as few as 10 – I wouldn’t have appreciated this book and would have stopped reading it rather quickly but today I can’t help but thrill to opening passages like: This tower, patched unevenly with black ivy, arose like a mutilated finger from among the fi"

2145,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,3,"One of the more pernicious aspects of epic fantasy is medieval stasis . Even as we celebrate the freedoms made possible through democracy, we revel in escapism to an inherently oppressive setting, where hereditary titles are standard-issue and the plot often involves helping a rightful heir regain the throne. This is but one of the many tensions that arises in Mervyn Peake’s Gormenghast (or Titus ) books. The eponymous castle is a grand affair in its own right, but it is the locus of a much grande"
2146,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,"There is much to say, and Peake used an awful lot of words himself. The writing is sometimes of Shakespearean quality at other times you will think of Dickens and Poe. Sometimes punches are delivered with overwhelming power, other times a scene is build up so elaborately and slowly it makes you wonder if time has indeed stopped. At well over 1000 pages, excluding all the extras, you are starting a long journey. I made a few pit stops on my way, relaxing with some less demanding books, and I advis"
2147,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,"Not to be compared with Lord of the Rings but appreciated as its own distinctive universe, owing more stylistic debts to Carroll, Poe, Dickens and a touch of Kafka, Mervyn Peake's world of Gormenghast is a dark and bizarre fairy tale without the fairies, or more aptly, a tale of grotesques. Once I gathered the rhythm of the prose, I couldn't escape the sprawling labyrinth that is the castle centerpiece of the first two novels, Titus Groan and Gormenghast , nor did I want to, which is why I, as so"

2150,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,"Mervyn Peake’s The Gormenghast Trilogy ( Titus Groan, Gormenghast, and Titus Alone ), published between 1946-1959, was originally conceived as a four or five book series, but the author died after the publication of only the first two books, the third having been reconstructed after his death from his notebooks.

2152,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,"Forgive the cliche, but there just are not enough stars for this trilogy. This is a masterswork about a fantastic world in a village in a castle. This is fantasy that owes absolutely nothing to Tolkien (not that I'm putting him down, LOTR is fabulous) If one thinks of Middle Earth as a Macrocosm, then Goremenghast is a Microcosm. Think of Dickens, Intoxicated with the English Language, writing a Gothic Fantasy, and you get some of the feeling. I have read this book 3 times, and I am sure I will"
2153,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,"I'd call it Shakespeare for the Lord of the Rings set. Did I just write that? Peake's imagination is otherwordly. His descriptive talent is singular. His language does remind me of Shakespeare or a particularly eloquent philosophical writer or something. The first two books are the best, concerning a dying feudal society and the leadership thereof. The monarchs have been forced, through layers and layers of tradition that no-one remembers the reasons for, to exercise complicated daily rituals. A"

The great gothic fantasy of Dickensian characters, vast engines of ritual and excitable melodrama and amazing names. The first thing is the writing. Words upon words upon words like brick upon brick.

(one book) I would give this epic 5 stars if it wasnt for the last book in the trilogy, ""Titus Alone"". It just doesnt fit in with the rest of the story and I actually skimmed through it because it felt disjointed to me. However, the first two books in the trilogy ""Titus Groan"" and ""Gormenghast"" are well worth a read. Weird, yes.

The writing is admirable. Rarely has a world been so vivid in my mind, and in such a distinctive style. Reading this, I saw the story unfold like an animated movie created with jagged quill pen drawings. This vivid style also applies to the characters, who are as distinctive as Dick Tracy villains. Mervyn Peake is a genius when it comes to naming his"
2166,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,2,"Amazing how many 5-star reviews admit to not finishing the trilogy and that the last novel is essentially illegible. Grade inflation I suppose. Readers are apparently supposed to overlook the plodding plotlessness because the characters and descriptions are so uber incredible, or something. But the characters are mere stereotypes and cartoons (the obese drunken chef, pedantic chief servant, the dreamy romantic 15-year-old girl, etc) and the lack of plot has much to do with how lame these characte"

Steerpike is one of most endearingly horrible character in literature. He's an anti-hero who almost becomes heroic. Gormenghast itself is mythic in its creation. This book is about everything.

2168,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,"How do you review a book that can't be compared to anything else? One of my favorite books of all time. Titus Groan and especially Gormenghast are outstanding. Titus Alone is a strange sequel that probably was influenced somewhat by Peake's progressing disease. Still worth reading. Bizarre, fantastical, Gothic, symbolic, surrealistic, beautiful. Peake's language is superb. Some of the most gorgeous prose to read."

They are so distilled and concentrated that each allows us a glimpse of a reality beyond our own.

2172,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,"It took me a long time to fully immerse myself in this work (until about halfway through the second book). Mervyn Peake 's prose is so dense as at times to be suffocating, necessitating a pause in which the reader can come up for air and reorient themselves.

2173,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,"Holy moly! Why didn't those of you who had read this emphasize to me how good it is? Peake's trilogy is occasionally compared to Tolkien's, but I think unjustly. It's fantasy, and multi-book (there's a fourth, posthumous volume of the series which I have yet to read, but in a moment, the reason), but the resemblance with Lord of the Rings ends, I believe, in those two rather general and obvious common grounds. Peake's work is after different quarry: it's gothic, dark, deeply pessimistic about the"
2174,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,"For all of its longueurs and faults and clumsinesses, the Gormenghast trilogy is incomparable: an extended act of verbal and visual imagination that goes beyond anything else, with a cast of characters that are never mere grotesques, and often heartbreakingly alive. I have to give it five stars, because it taught me how to read. Utterly immersive and always oddly real, even at its wildest extremes. What makes the trilogy really special, and not just a gargantuan wallow in baroque excesses of lan"

Though Tolkien is one of my favorites I never thought that comparison was entirely fitting. It is true that both Gormenghast and Lord of the Rings are heavy prose, full of beautifully crafted language. I would argue though that lOTR relies much more on plot. Gormenghast is almost nothing but character study (at least in the first two novels). And Peake made his characters so vibrantly grotesque that doing a single c"

2185,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,3,"This gothic castle trilogy is rich and detailed. You'll feel the cold in this highly charged castle, as a bizarre array of characters perform a bizarre array of acts. The richness after a while does make it challenging and it really is all scene and no summary, so it does take a patient reader. I admired parts of it. And feel as though it's probably better to dip in and out of rather than read straight through. You'll marvel over a few pages read at random."
2186,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,"The outstanding quality of this trilogy is its uniqueness. The pace is slow, the atmosphere Byzantine and Gothic. If Peake was thinking of another writer or of another style, I have not read of it nor have I encountered it. As regards content, the first two books constitute a continuous narrative. If you like the first, continue to the second. The third volume is almost entirely different, as if it had another author."
2187,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,One of my all time favorite books. Only serious readers should even attempt it. It has some of the most fabulous long drawn out descriptions ever. Mr. Peake was an artist as well as a writer. The book has some truly odd little drawings all through it.

Only the mind of someone like Mervyn Peake could conjure up such a fantastical, Gothic, picturesque series of incredible texts. The whole series has an alluring feel to it; it sucks you in almost immediately to a fantastical world apart from ours, full of winding corridors, Gothic masonry and grotesque, strange characters. This world is so wonderfully realised, it is hard not to feel like you are in the castle, like you have stepped through a painting. And while th"

Purposely neglecting the odd third part which is in most parts not connected to the other two, the uniqueness is mostly a matter of scope. It's not a sweeping epic but rather an intimate play in the claustrophobic atmosphere of the castle Gormenghast.

I knew that our main character (Titus Groan) would not yet be 2 at the end of the first novel, but I had no idea how Mervyn Peake would work that through. He does overuse many phrases (repetition is a horrible crutch when writing long paragraphs), but in the end it all feels necessary to reinforce the mood of stagnancy that fills the castle and makes"
2205,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,2,"Oh you guys. Gormenghast was nearly the death of me. I dragged myself through that book like a small, ragged mouse, wounded in battle with vile scorpions, drags himself across the burning sands of the desert. The sun beats mercilessly upon his small, furry head; he can't open his eyes against the glare; and he leaves a tiny, pitiful trail of blood in his pathetic wake, as he searches in vain for a drop of water and for shelter from the circling vultures. Now that you have some idea of what readi"
2206,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,"Why don't more people talk about Mervyn Peake? His writing is simply fantastic and I feel lucky to have found him. That being said, Titus Alone is not my favorite but I'm still happy to have found my way here. Titus Groan and Gormenghast should be on everyone's must read list."
2207,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,"I loved this book, but man, was it cumbersome at times. Mervyn Peake was an artist prior to becoming a writer and he has the artist's eye for detail in his fiction. Expect long, protracted descriptions of settings and cartoonish characters that are borderline barking mad. It's best suited for nighttime reading (what isn't)and a strong sense of patience and melancholy adventure. The castle itself, Gormenghast, is the lead character of the first two books. It's described as an impossibly large, ancie"
2208,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,2,"Titus Groan and Gormenghast, the first 2 books in the trilogy, deal with the goings-on in Gormenghast, a crumbling palace building the size of a small city, the inhabitants of which live in accordance with prescribed rituals and precedent, the reasons for which have been forgotten. Steerpike, a boy from the palace kitchens, determined to improve his lot, begins to manipulate his way up the stratified society. Into this volatile situation, Titus Groan, the 77th earl of Groan, is born. Well writte"
2209,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,"WARNING: This is a sloooooooow book. Really slow. Slow like molasses. Slow so you can savor it in the back of your mouth and brain. If you want a book whose technical mastery is secondary in your priorities to the plot, this is the book for you. If not, for the love of god, stay away. Fortunately, I'm in the former category and I can hardly describe just how well this book is written, even if it takes the plot a whole novel to really get some steam going. This is truly epic characterization and wo"
2210,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,"Mervyn Peake is guilty through and through of loving alliteration and adjectives, preferably combined. Quoting M. de Norpois from In Search of Lost Time , it's ""that nonsense of stringing together fine-sounding words and only afterwards troubling about what they mean."" But despite (or because of) that flaw, Peake is incredibly good at creating moody scenes & vivid characters who you probably wouldn't want to meet but enjoy reading about. Gormenghast, as a whole, is a brilliant example of weird"
2211,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,"One of the greatest fantasy trilogies ever created. The characters are as monumental as the sprawling castle itself. What I found significant is how interesting it all was, because there is so much fantasy that suffers when going into description. There is an air of mystery and the ancient in place during all of these novels that doesn't really have a comparison to anything else I've ever read. The last novel was, unfortunately, written while the author was literally going insane. It is one of th"
2212,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,"I still haven't read Titus Alone the third book (which is supposed to be very different and which Peake never got the chance to properly finish). Titus Groan and Gormenghast conjure up a unique, labyrinthine fantasy world with few if any fantastical/magical elements. We're presented with the sprawling, half-ruined Castle Gormenghast and its surroundings that seem to exist in total isolation. It's inhabited by grotesque characters whose stratified, ritual-governed society is inspired by British ar"
2213,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,2,"I gave up on this book. After 260 pages you'd think you're hooked enough to finish the book, but somehow this wasn't the case for me. I struggled to get through the first 260 pages and the idea that there would be over 700 more to go, left me with so much reluctance that I decided to give up and start something new. When I first found this book and read the reviews, I was immediately curious. Peake was compared to Tolkien in many of the reviews, and, as a LotR lover, I therefore almost felt the"
2214,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,"This is an incredible book--because the trilogy really is one book, in three sections, I think. Actually, the third book, Titus Alone, was never finished (Peake had Parkinson's and died before he finished it), but that's probably okay because (SPOILERS) once Titus leaves Gormenghast, the heart kind of goes out of the whole project. Gormenghast, its labyrinth of tradition and corridors, is the absolute centre of the first two books. It does take some getting used to: the syntax is often technical"
2215,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,"Like all the other reviews say, Peake's descriptive power is out-of-this-world. 99% percent sure that you'll never read anything similar. It's really, really weird. But if you're a fan of the unexplainable, of myth, horror or fantasy, all wrapped up in a pretty Gothic package, eat your heart out. It's like the author climbed into my head and teased out every dream and fantasy. If I could, I'd be handing out paperbacks by the bucket load to random people passing by. Dr Prunesquallor and Mr. Flay"
2216,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,3,"If Charles Dickens decided to write fantasy novels, he would probably write something like Gormenghast. Although frankly, I think Peake is a better writer than Dickens. They both write outrageously long novels that detail dark, sooty and unpleasant people and places. They both introduce new characters that it's hard to invest in after 500 pages or so with the old ones. The characters have odd names that vaguely insinuate their personality. Peake is also more lyrical in his writing, sometimes swa"
2217,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,"I am about two-thirds of the way through the second in this eccentric but wonderful trilogy. I had thought when I began reading it that my days of appreciating fantasy novels were long gone: and I admit it was a bit of a slow start. Now I can't wait to see what happens to Titus, the young Earl of Groan, who lives along with a cast of bizarre and wonderful characters, in the amazing Castle. Peake's very visual descriptions of the characters (like the Duchess and her herd of white cats) are riveti"
2218,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,1,"When I first announced that I wanted to be a fantasy author, at age 12 or so, I was given a copy of Gormenghast and the Lord of the Rings, and between them they nearly sent me scurrying into science fiction. I hated Gormenghast with a passion usually reserved for kidney beans. I found the language old and pretentious, the characters just ridiculous beyond the point of caricature and I was somewhere in Titus Alone before I decided that there was no plot to speak of and if there was I had clearly m"
2219,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,1,"I hardly know how to rate these books. The tone of the book is entirely negative - even the ""positive"" ending. Each character seems to be the personification of the most negative of human traits. Although the first two novels imply a static medieval world, the third novel reveals an alternative modern world beyond the castle. The motivations of the characters are not plausible; I suppose one could say this was done on purpose for ""artistic"" reasons. The plot is trivial, even comic. When I finish"
2220,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,2,"Like Gormenghast castle, these books sprawl, filled with meandering passages, forgotten wings, ornate, baroque prose studded with superfluous crenellations. Unused, unnecessary, and in my case, mostly unread. I made it to page 448, but to be fair, at least 200 of those pages passed by my eyes unfocused and ignored. I skimmed, skated and slid through long, long, long, so very long, descriptions of things almost entirely unrelated to the plot or even any of the characters. I wanted to like this, a"
2221,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,"I re-read the first two parts of this every couple of years or so. The first time I read it was back in High School, right after finishing Lord of the Rings . Someone recommended it and I started it thinking it was more of the same. Completely wrong. Despite the mass acceptance of LotR , I really enjoy these books much more; the mood, the curious characters, the life of rules (or the rules that govern their life) the castle, the ending of Gomanghast , the prose itself, resonates with me. One of my key"
2222,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,2,"I read the first 2 of these books, and really didn't like them. They did remind me of Dickens a lot - and I'm not a big fan of Dickens either, so that might explain it! All the characters were grotesque caricatures, and the general mood was claustrophobic, banal and depressing. I'd expected to really love these books, from what I'd heard about them - but I was disappointed. Maybe it was just my state of mind at the time - I don't know. I did really love the concept of the endless castle - but the"
2223,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,3,"Great descriptive novels - you really really get to know the characters more than nearly any other series I have read. Very dark, not-quite-fantasy novel about the ruin of the ancient Gormenghast family and their dependence on ritual and routine to keep their sorry kingdom going. Peake does a great job of letting us inside the characters heads...but as great as these novels are, they are very difficult reads and I have failed at completing them twice now, though I appreciate them better each tim"
2224,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,"Mysterious, strange, incongruous, cunning, scary, fantastical. This book is unlike any other I have read. So vivid in description that I found myself believing it in it's entirety even though I knew at each moment that the world I'd entered into wasn't real. Gormenghast is spectacular in it's decline, it's characters magnificent in their strangeness. Not for the faint hearted but not completely inaccessible, this book needs space - give yourself plenty of time to read, reflect and continue and y"
2225,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,3,"I really dug these books as an adolescent, when I had more of the root-and-branch, sour and cynical worldview they purvey. I found them hard slogging on a revisit, and put down Titus Groan after ten or so chapters; it bugged me more that the characters were all caricatures, their physical and mental eccentricities engraved with great precision and inventiveness, but choking any sympathy I might feel for them."
2226,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,3,"I wasn't really successful in 'getting into' this book until after I saw the BBC's serialised production (2000) of Gormenghast, which really helped me to visualise and get my head around the (most peculiar) world of Gormenghast. This is a text of a huge and remarkable imagination. As an aside, the poem ""The Frivolous Cake"" (on pages 58-59) is a great performance piece."
2227,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,"My 14-year-old self adored these books. Reading them required frequent dipping into my dictionary, but I loved the painterly language, the weird, knotty characters, and the sustained crepuscular (hello!) mood. I read out the opening paragraph to my English class, and they were all WTF?, but screw them! I've re-read the series several times. And Maeve Peake's unofficial sequel."
2228,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,"This is the only book i have really struggled to read..however when i finished it i found that i really enjoyed it, even if it did take me 2 months to read! fantastically gothic, twists, turns and utterly brilliant characters. i would definitely read this again, even if it is huge!"
2229,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,2,"This book is simply too difficult to read. At most, I could read ~20 pages at a time before my eyes glazed over. There is a lot of good stuff here, but I'm not sure if it's worth the effort to slog through to it."
2230,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,"I enjoyed the first two books and hated Titus alone, save for the last paragraph. The setting is the best part of the book, the endless, rotting castle with its oppressive traditions and pointless rituals. The characters are quite good as well, with Steerpike and Flay being very memorable."
2231,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,"In a nutshell... Books 1 & 2; stunning, monumental etc. Book 3; mad as a badger on a bouncy castle, appropriately."
2232,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,1,"Whose idea was this? Awful schlock. Bored me to tears in the first dozen pages. I kept trying, but it got no better."
2233,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,1,"Couldn't finish this one. The writing was rich and clever, but the pacing just way too slow."
2234,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,Loved this but not so keen on Titus Alone. First two books brilliant and glad I finally read this after it sitting on my bookshelf for 15 years!
2235,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,"Amazing book! Essential reading for all :-) I'm not too sure why there was a third book but whatever, all I know is that my imagination hurts :D!"
2236,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,"If you like the literary equivalent of a maze carved out of a briar patch with a very tiny knife, this is the series for you."
2237,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,"Almost perfect fantasyland, long before fantasy became the thing."
2238,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,"Gormenghast is a massive tome, a book with twists and turns reminiscent of the Castle of Gormenghast itself. With enough characters to satisfy a fan of Tolstoy or Dickens, this book is unique in the fact that I had not heard of Mervyn Peake or the Gormenghast series before. Although this book is compared to the works of Tolkien, this series is not one that jumps into the collective consciousness. Back when I had an idea of reading a whole ton of books, I found the titles and the author in one of"
2239,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,"Like many other's, I vastly enjoyed the first two books. Like many other's, I did not care for the third book - I couldn't even finish it. I've been trying to finish it for a year, but I just don't have it in me to keep picking it back up. The first two books are well written, enchanting, suspenseful, tragic, and strange. It's a little bit of culture shock in a book in sections. There are parts that you have no idea why they are included (ex: in the first five pages of the first book) but withou"
2240,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,"Why people don’t add this to the humour shelf is beyond me. It’s funnier than a lot of books. Irma Prunesquallor finding love? The Doctor and his bonkers rants? The Professors all going on the same date? The Headmaster’s upside-down death? I laughed out loud many times. Also, the advice some people give to read each part using a separate physical book – because it’s too heavy to hold as a ‘trilogy’ – is poppycock. Get the doorstop bumper edition and let the incredible thing make your arms ache."
2241,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,3,"This trilogy is hard to review as one book, so I have split it here: Book 1: Peake uses the brooding, grim world of Gormenghast to introduce the caricatures of his ensemble cast, brilliantly formed individuals who are believable more for their exaggerated behaviours, than in spite of. The book is at its strongest when Peake uses his broad vocabulary to bring to life the brilliant natural features of the landscape. Unfairly labelled fantasy, Gormenghast is instead analogy and setting, written as a"
2242,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed the chaos, lunacy, beautiful English, the slow build up of each character, the multiple holy fucks throughout the series but the only thing I have to be honest and hold up my hands and say oh well there's one little thing I have to come out and confess about this whole thing and that is as much as I've tried and Oh God have I tried, it was like when I tried to watch the Exorcist 2 or the Omen 4 or Superman 3 and 4, it was a chore but I eventually got around to doing it but m"
2243,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,"This ginormous volume of a book took the better part of three years to read. And I have to say, I absolutely loved it. Mervyn Peake quickly became one of my favourites, right up there with J.R.R. Tolkien, Haruki Murakami, and Margaret Atwood. It took me forever to read, given how large the book itself was, as well as the fact that oftentimes everything seemed to move ever. so. slowly. And yet, here I am absolutely in love with it because of the story, the characters, the gothic world created and"
2244,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,"Fascinating!!!! This book is a perfect example of why I love book challenges. I would have never picked this book up to read if it wasn't for the category of ""a genre you've never heard of"" had not been on my list. It was recommended to me by a nice young man in the used book store. There are actually 3 books in my copy, but I've only read the first book, Gormenghast, so far, but I will go back and finish the other 2. Mervyn Peake, the author, has a wonderful, vivid, bizarre imagination! The book i"
2245,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,3,"Unlike anything I've ever read. Were Peake trying to get this published presently, I'm not sure he'd ever make it past the submissions heap. It lacks the momentum, the immediate hook, all the current necesities, and yet somehow through sheer descriptive power and individuality kept me curious. I wanted to know what the point of the strangely horrible caricature characters was, whether there was some actual plot or whether it was just a succession of strangeness, and I'll point out here nothing hap"
2246,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,"What did you think of the Gormenghast Trilogy? I think composing a eulogy for my twin brother would be simpler (he is still alive). Although struggling for words, this quote is near perfect: ""[Peake's books] are actual additions to life; they give, like certain rare dreams, sensations we never had before, and enlarge our conception of the range of possible experience"" (C. S. Lewis) Gormenghast is sublime, the greatest books in the English language and the only books I have read which I could desc"
2247,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,"The first two novels are a gothic masterpiece and should stand alone as a complete story. Titus Groan and Gormenghast tell of a symbolic journey through the crumbling edifice of tradition and toward adulthood. The third book, Titus Alone, is oddly apocryphal and disjointed. Some of that is surely due to Peake's final illness at the time of writing but not all - there's a sense of the unnecessary and aimless to the third book which is why the trilogy as a whole loses a star. It would have been best"
2248,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,3,"Couldn't bring myself to finish this. Forty pages in to volume 2, and I just wanted to skip so much of it that it became pointless. The problem is the prose. Peake rambles forever on minor details that, in more managed quantity, would be rich texturing and happy diversion, but it just reads as though he put down every last thought that occurred to him and nobody bothered to edit any of it out. So, despite there being a good book buried in there somewhere, the effort of getting to it was more than"
2249,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,"It's weird to think of this book as both a classic and a cult classic, it appeared the same time as the LOTR but while that became big and would eventually create an entire franchise and genre, Mervyn Peak's Gormenghast remained in the shadows. It some ways it suits it with its strange Gothic crumbling castle of Gormenghast filled with angry people and its weird landscapes of carvers and eventually flying cars. It's a fantastic book and this edition includes Peake's own illustrations of his Dick"
2250,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,"I very rarely venture into the realms of fantasy fiction and this has sat on my bookshelf for three years whilst I summoned up the energy to tackle it. But it was worth it. Peake's writing is stunning - every sentence is beautifully created, completely drawing the reader into the strange world of Gormenghast and its odd cast of characters. Weird and wonderful, this is a trilogy to read slowly and indulge in, even if the final book does seem slightly off-kilter with the other two."
2251,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,"This is perhaps the most difficult book I've ever read -- and I've read Derrida. It took me the entire summer to finish. But this series is a towering classic, an absolutely essential work that bears no resemblance to anything else. Peake's characterization, worldbuilding and prose style are beyond compare. The plot is often nonexistent, but when it's exciting, it's *very* exciting. Reading it is worth the effort."
2252,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,"I read this book after watching the BBC series. My English is pretty good, even if I'm not a native speaker, but still I had to look up at least one word every other page. That doesn't mean the books were unreadable. It's just that Peakes' vocabulary is amazing, and the world of Ghormenghast evocative, weird, bleak, sinister - it's like walking through a house of fun mirrors where everything is distorted. I loved the novels and I would certainly reccomend them."
2253,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,"I enjoyed this book in the way I enjoy a trip to the zoo: look at all the amazing creatures! It also has some well-built plots. If you are able to suspend your disbelief, you'll probably enjoy it a lot. Still, I wish that it were a little more closely connected to reality. I don't mean more realistic; but with more of a feeling of representing a deeper reality, like the Moomintroll books, or The Lightning Jar (a recent book in a similar vein that I think deserves a shout-out)."
2254,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,"It took me ages to finish this. This was given to me by my uncle, who loved the series, but I found it slow to start. I finished the last book - which was so different from the previous books that it gave me whiplash. 1: 3 stars 2: 5 stars!!! 3: 2 stars Im just going to give it 4 stars - hard to want to read but utterly unputdownable once you start."
2255,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,"Read a long time ago I thoroughly enjoyed this, especially Titus groan and Gormenghast, Titus alone wasn't quite so impressive. Reluctantly, I decided to get the DVD a most unusual decision for me as more often than not the visual media usually disappoints but this most definitely didn't although, of course, the book still remains the better option."
2256,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,"Castle Gormenghast is a sprawling, decaying, gothic labyrinth. Its deliciously-Dickensian inhabitants are its strength: scheming Steerpike, wild Fucshia, Lord Sepulchrave and Titus: the boy about to inherit it all."
2257,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,"Fantastic in every way. But just as I cannot eat a large cheesecake every night, I cannot read words this rich every night. After three weeks and being well into the second book, I must stop. A case of literary ""clogged arteries"". It is just too much. But I loved the parts I imbibed."
2258,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,2,"Somewhere in here is a good story, but the writing style drowns the narrative. At times the language is so obscure that the meaning is lost and that really makes this a chore to get through. Steerpike is one of the best villains ever created and his arc is such that he for me was the hero."
2259,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,Three of the best books I have ever read.
2260,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,"Nearly perfect - the final section was notably weaker, but for the most part a masterpiece of gloom."

I found it frustrating, infuriating, full of false starts and weird tangents, but intensely poetic, detailed, lyrical and hypnotic, like Tristram Shandy by way of Wiliam Blake. Well, maybe not quite that. Throw in also grotesque and fabulous human caricatures, like the weirdest of Dickens or Lewis Carroll, every one of them (there are dozens) sporting fantastic names li"

Sure enough, I found myself pulled into the world of Gormenghast, and I decided that I had to read the books as well. Finding them for less than $30, as I'm a poor college student, proved a challenge and I ultimately ended up purchasing the entire trilogy, in one incredibly fat book, off Amazon, and I sat down to read.

2272,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,"The Gormenghast novels should be read to one in childhood, or delved into over a lifetime, over tea, in the form of an ancient and intimidating tome. Peake has created a bizarre and complicated painting to rival the masters in grotesqueness and caricature, but at its heart the painting depicted is a fairy tale of maturity and individual growth. As it is a painting, there is very little action or movement in the story, and what little there is is described in a languorous, lurid manner. Steerpike,"

More recently, I decided it might be time to give it another try. It centers around an immense Gothic castle on a cliff where ritual is paramount, and everyone's lives are dominated by meaningless ceremony. The rulers and staff are eccentrics with descriptive names that sound like parts of an allegory: the Groan family, the fat and sadistic chef Swelter, the Master of Ritual Sourdust, the per"

He looks so alive and modern -- better even.) I'm 3/4's thru. It's a castle story, of a vast, dreary stone place with dozens of bleak yet over-the-top characters. No real heroes, exactly. No magic, no Little People. Lots of grey and crumbling stone. Some heroism emerges at a point, I won't say where. I'm not sure that it's the key to the tale, but it"
2279,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,"The Gormenghast trilogy is the brilliant invention of Mervyn Peake, who created a unique, imaginative, bizarre and compelling world in the form of an enormous decaying castle called Gormenghast. It's titular head is the Earl of Gormenghast, but the place is really ruled by the arcane and stringent rituals that define and dictate daily life for everyone from the Earl to the lowliest kitchen boy. The story begins with the birth of Titus Groan, heir to the seventy-sixth Earl of Gormenghast, Lord Se"

Set in a fantastical decaying society, whose surrender to madness and nature is reflected in the minds and spirits of its peoples as well as within the very stonework of Gormenghast itself. This work is a reflection of well-observed social mores, attitudes and conventions that comment as strongly on society today as it did in the era of"
2282,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,2,"The Gormenghast Novels are a trap; a beautiful trap that ensnares its characters and its readers. Unfortunately, it's not a good ensnarement. These stories focus on the elite members of the Groan family, who live in the mysterious castle of Gormenghast, which may very well be alive. These characters, who are without fail highly eccentric, are stuck in a rigid life of ritual and tradition; there are literally hundreds of ceremonies, rituals, and traditions that appear meaningless but strictly enf"

This covers the events from the birth of Titus, to his becoming 77th Earl of Gormenghast, just after his first birthday. The pacing of the book feels quite slow, initially, and does take some getting used to. But the atmosphere is incredible and as the manipulative Steerpike navigates his way upwards through the House of Groan, I founds myself utterly sucked into the story. Obvious"
2284,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,2,"I finally decided to stop torturing myself by trying to finish Titus Alone , and it lifted such a weight off my shoulder. It's difficult to rate a collection of three novels, especially when you have to give up on the last of the three in disgust and boredom. It says something when, out of a large cast of people, easily my favorite character and the most interesting character is the castle .

I've done some research since starting this review and understand better how the last of the trilogy came into existence. That feeds my determination to view the series as being two books that end with Titus riding off into the unknown. I'll just proceed from there. Having said that, I can take a deep breath and state for the record that these books are quite an experience. These books are the ultimate example of the journey being"
2286,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,"It seems churlish to fault the Gormenghast trilogy as flawless; that it isn’t is only partially the author’s fault. The first two books are extraordinary, a triumph of atmosphere and sense of place. Peake captures the claustrophobia of Gormenghast, a place of inertia hidebound by tradition and archaic rules populated almost solely by grotesques. Every character, every action is saturated in symbolism, Peake’s writing is often so dense in conveying what’s going on it approaches poetry – given how"
2287,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,2,"Wow, Peake's trilogy sure tries to fit into many literary categories. A pity the author can't handle any of them competently or consistently. Titus Groan (1st of the 3 novels) has been widely admired as a groundbreaking fantasy that presents a completely original world without relying on any magical devices. So far, so good. But the originality partly reflects the paucity of Peake's characters and the their vacuousness. Peake over and over asserts the characters' devotion to ritual, but the examp"

Just about to start reading Titus Awakes (even though he didnt actually write that one... ) I love Peake s grotesque, broken-mirror fantasy world. His command of the language is sublime. Peake s grasp of human psychology is what sets this all above most writers. In Gormenghast (Book 2) the detail he puts into the love story between Irma Prunesquallor and the headmaster is insightful, sharp, and very, very human."

The outbreaks of treachery and violence - even though they occur suddenly and chaotically - feel like spiky upwellings of this inevitable, massive narrative machine beneath the surface of things. It is a book for people who like language; Peake is gifted at metaphor, and the language of the series grows increasingly poetic over the span of an early lifetime, from the"

Bound together in one volume, this trilogy (Titus Groan, Gormenghast and Titus Alone) details the life and adventures of Titus Groan, the seventy-seventh Earl of Groan and Lord of Gormenghast. It is an epic, gothic fantasy that is at times nightmarish, other times witty and darkly funny.

The first two books, Titus Groan and Gormenghast are full of indelible images and some of the most grotesque characters I have ever come across in literature. The simple evil ambitions of the youth Steerpike seems commonplace among the vividly drawn characters of these novels.

I couldn't get into it, so I left it behind. Four years later and I actually enjoyed it! First, Mervyn Peake was an illustrator.

The writing is beautiful but sometimes I just wished Peake would get to the point. I mentally compared it to 100 Years of Solitude because, for me, both were a struggle to read but had the most amazing images. The way the Queen's cats flow around her in a white cloud, how it's described, is so evocative. I read it as a beautiful metaphor for something that's meant to be elegant but is really dirty"

Titus Groan: 4 stars I really don't know how to describe Titus Groan. It is, perhaps, in a genre all to itself. It isn't realistic, but it isn't precisely fantasy, either. Fantastic things happen, but there is no magic. It is an odd, quirky book with much darkness. It is written by an author that loves words, but is an amazing wordsmith.

Peake was an illustrater and portrait artist from Britain who served time in the army during World War II.

This novel, if you can call it that, is gothic, mysterious, unsettling, and creaks of ancient ways and unspoken secrets. I found the writing rich and heavy, but it was horribly slow going.

2303,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,"I did not finish the third book in the trilogy. The change in setting and theme was too jarring for me to continue with Titus Alone. This is definitely not a quick and easy read, but it is extremely enjoyable all the same. While slow, the first two books are filled with eccentric characters as well as moments of tension between them. Scenes such as Swelter's grotesque war against Flay and Steerpike's various manipulative relationships are unforgettable. Peake's language sparkles and flows through"
2304,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,3,"I've reviewed the three component books separately-- these are my comments for the series as a whole. Basically, this volume contains two very good, finished books, that are more or less a complete story between them. It also contains an effectively unfinished third novel-- Titus Alone was edited together from Peake's drafts while he was still alive, but after his Parkinson's had gotten bad enough that he could no longer contribute to the process. I'm less inclined to judge it as harshly as I di"
2305,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,"For sheer, sustained, imaginative power; an unfailing attention to character detail (Dickens' caricatures had none of this realism); a brooding, dark humour that goes deeper than any other work I can think of against a backdrop of unimaginably stifling rigidity and routine, Gormenghast has not been bettered by anyone in any genre. Full-stop. Titus Groan acts almost as an appetizer for the grandeur of the second in the trilogy. The immensity of the crumbling castle, it's labyrinthine corridors, ro"

Too many reviewers try to classify these books as ""gothic"", ""science fiction"", or ""literature"". I must admit that when I first read these books back in the late 60s and early 70s as a college student, I was not impressed. I had to mature, myself, in order to develop a full appreciation for what Peake did. Despite not liking the books back then, the essence of Gormanghast has always stuck in my mind. Recent"
2307,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,"Quite frankly, this book was amazing. The ultra-descriptive passages that it's peppered with, and that make it a very long read, are absolutely astounding at times. There are many paragraphs that I reread just because they were so beautiful, and the descriptions were so vivid and alive. If I could write half so well as Peake I would be very pleased indeed. This book would certainly not be for everyone, but it's certainly for me. I would love to read the first two books of the trilogy again some"
2308,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,"This title is actually a trilogy completed by Peake detailing the life of Titus Groan, but perhaps more importantly the life of Gormenghast and the rituals that lie behind its ancient walls. The recurring theme found throughout the series is the knowing of ones self through the surroundings of ones childhood. Titus is in constant struggle to rebel from his past and create a new path; a path set forth by his own making. The conclusion of the series is quite revealing to Peake's purpose and settle"

Titus Alone - ...erm... not so good, this installment. put's the ""Groan"" in the series, for sure.

2310,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,"There is simply no competition, this is without a doubt my favourite book of all time. I save my 5 star ratings for those books which 'get under my skin', and this one absolutely did. Peake doesn't just write a story, he paints a picture with words, and the result is truly beautiful. One is transported to the castle of Gormenghast, the characters are well written, each with their individual quirks and personalities.

Lewis, but you won't find any elves or wizards hidden within the walls of Gormenghast. Schemes within schemes, ruthless anti-heros, a very, convoluted family tree and a suitably byzantine conglomeration of architecture to go with it. In keeping with Tolkein and Lewis' style, there's more verbage and wordiness than you'd think necessary, but th"

Although frankly, I think Peake is a better writer than Dickens. They both write outrageously long novels that detail dark, sooty and unpleasant people and places. They both introduce new characters that it's hard to invest in after 500 pages or so with the old ones. The characters have odd names that vaguely insinuate their personality. Peake is also more lyrical in his writing, sometimes swapp"

The three books centre on Gormenghast castle, a place so ancient its beginnings are lost in history and with timeless traditions and rituals whose meaning is long since forgotten. It is in an intricate and densely gothic tale peopled by grotesques and lunatic characters, centring on the ambitious Steerpike and his sinister ascent through the castle's social structures. Mervyn Peake has fashioned as odd and weird a fiction as I've come across, but the whole thing is str"

Sometimes it took more than four pages in the longer chapters to find out about whom the author was talking. But I persevered and read this trilogy, although it will be only once. You can feel that the author was a poet and the used language is not the easiest to get. The story that he tries to tell is a bizarre one. And the leading figure is a sad figure, a kind of an antihero. All the other characters a"

It wasn’t until I saw the trailer for the upcoming The Golden Compass movie that I was introduced to Lyra’s world.

I first read these when I was very young (maybe 11/12) and I remember absolutely loving them. This still remains true to this day and they are excellent books the second time through too.

2341,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,"So, I was interested in reading The Golden Compass series by Phillip Pullman (The Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife, The Amber Spyglass) because some parents have asked us to remove it from the shelf at the school library. After hearing the allegations about the books (that they are intended to persuade children to become atheists), I was feeling like people had not given them a chance. I had already begun to read The Golden Compass before I had heard about any of the controversy, after all, and"
2342,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"Northern Lights / The Golden Compass - 12Nov16 4 stars Breathtaking and smart and utterly brilliant. Reading several of Pullman's interviews has made me decide to re/read the Chronicles of Narnia at some point in 2017; the misconception that His Dark Materials is a direct rebuttal of Narnia has interested me for years, and then to finally read this and hear from Pullman himself that it is NOT said rebuttal makes it that much more interesting.

2344,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,Defenitely a winner! Normally this sort of fantasy books is not my cup of tea but I adored reading this book. The themes it handles are very grown-up (I don't understand how a child could understand all what is in the book). It never becomes trivial or laughable. Everyone thinks very logically. The plans are well taught over and everyone handles according to this plans. I don't know what to say more about the book. Just read it!

It still stands as the only book that has ever made me cry. I was a wreck after finishing it, to the point where I literally could not sleep because I couldn’t believe it was over. Not only was the ending beautifully heartbreaking, but I had to accept the fact that these characters' journeys had come to an end, the series was over, and it was time for me to move on in my life. I just couldn't"

It was simple yet lovely, with interesting characters, setting, plot. It was so engrossing that I managed to read the last third of it at the courthouse, between jury duty sessions. I'm sure that a large part of my sheer pleasure at reading this comes from the setting itself, having long been fascinated by the far North, but I think there's quite enough there for those less enamored of snow, ice, and polar"

However, I gave up on this book on page 277. I think 277 pages is more than enough to get an idea of whether or not a book is worth finishing. This one isn't worth finishing. I really don't care about the controversy surrounding the author, his philosophy and how it's presented in the book. All I care about is that it's ponderous, preachy and annoying. I've read too many"

To be honest, I didn't understand the books, or the impact they had on me, until we started re-reading them last year. It's a re-read that got much richer with time, delighting and surpris"
2357,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,3,"I like my wild, adventurous fantasy tales as much as the next fella, but I have some issues with this series. First, it clearly wants to be the anti-Narnia, and that's fine, but I wish it wasn't so blatant about it. Many of the characters exist solely as two-dimensional metaphors and many of the plot developments and magical or fantastical elements of the world seem to exist solely to make the point that no, we're not in Narnia anymore, the lion is not Jesus and actually the church is trying to"

I will start saying that I don't understand what is the whole fuss about this saga. I don't like it at all. In fact, I have come to a point where I hate these books with the exception of the first. They are bad, and I can demonstrate that without mentioning Pullman's beliefs (although it somewhat includes them since I hate the way Pullman presented religious people or other things but I will deal with i"

Censorship, as a colleagues button says, does not protect innocence, it only promotes ignorance. But I also do think that we should be careful with the books out there. There are some books that are not meant for kids of certain ages, simply because they are not yet ready to handle the content. This is true about the Golden Compass series.

I would have loved to have read this when I was a teenager! Anyways, on to the review: The Golden Compas The storyline in The Golden Compas is so well-crafted, compelling and interdependent that it's hard to tell much of it without revealing too much but I'll try.

The first book was pretty good. Once I got used to the fact that it took place in a parallel steam-punk world where things were almost the same but spelled differently, I was able to enjoy the creative and fast-paced adventure. The second book I read in a single sitting on a plane. This one got a little confusing - th"

Pullman's trilogy is famous for being a tad dark for a middle grade/YA trilogy and a tad naughty for ruffling some religious feathers. These are the things I enjoyed about the trilogy. I found the darkness of the story quite refreshing, and the whole ""remove a false god"" plot concept interesting. That said, I'm not in love with the execution of the concept. I thought North"

I'm still in the third. It's one of those that I dread reading, but I feel a stupid obligation to finish a book once I've started. Golden Compass is great. Fun characters, intriguing plot, some mystery and suspense. The Subtle Knife is about half as good. It introduces a somewhat enjoyable new character with a really cool knife, which is neat"

Thank GOD I finished this series though (see what I did there?). I actually liked the first book, the second book was okay, but the last book I wanted it to end right after the first few chapters. The tone and structure of these books bothered me the most. All the books don't really flow well together if you read them as one book. The first book is kind of the stranded novel, the secon"

Rigidly religious people should probably avoid these books because I'm not exaggerating when I say it's blasphemous.

The Golden Compass was an interesting read. Pullman succeeds in creating a very imaginative world where the main character, Lyra Belacqua, discovers bizarre and spell bounding places.

If you look at them from a simple, this book is just a book (as most are), the concept is interesting, complex, and a lovely tale about strange happenings. If you look at it how Pullman would like you to, it kind of makes the whole thing wither and die in a cruel sort of way. Which, as most of us readers can gather, sucks. Yeah, sucks pretty much describes it. It's as though once you r"
2386,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"Quite seriously one of the best, most well written, awe-inspiring series I have read. It seamlessly weaves together such diverse concepts as quantum theory, religion, relativity and spirituality as the framework for a story that is really all about childhood and friendship, as well as the gut-wrenching decisions we all have to make in this life (be with your true love or save the universe?).

Mind you, I'm coming at this as someone who agrees with a lot of what he seems to have to say--atheism, antitheism, the whole schmear--but it seems he's too hung up on defeating the influence of religion and lets it get in the way of his point.

Truly awful, with whole chapters (like the one with the wheel-people, or Mulefa) which should have been red-penciled by the publisher. How this ever became a bestseller is beyond me."
2391,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,They should've kept making the movies....they would've been spectacular! But then...these books aren't for everyone. Someone who doesn't have an open mind wouldn't be able to handle them. They were fascinating and intrigueing and I loved them!

2395,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"This is how you write a book. (I consider the three as one giant, thousand page novel) The unique prose of Pullman's writing style is put to excellent use, and to think that this is a young adult novel is frankly astounding given the subject material. This is up there with Harry Potter excellence, and to be honest Pullman is a better writer than Rowling, so dare I say it's even better? Not that the two should be compared because they exist on extremely separate planes. This story revolves around a"

In fact, I forgot about most of this book, except for the Tokay scene, because of how laborious it is. The first time I read this book, I gave up because of the Tokay scene!

Heart-wrenching!"

I am also extremely excited to learn more about Lyra in the next few years, who was always my least favorite part of this world, but as someone with a kiddo very much like a Lyra so far .... Yeah, I get it now, and she's going to grow up into someone amazing."

My first reading of His Dark Materials wasn't even complete: I got to around chapter 4 in the Amber Spyglass and got bored or distracted.

Despite dropping the final book a few concepts stuck with me, at least consciously, for many years afterwards: the idea of a constant companion that could soothe"
2405,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,"I won't lie, I started reading the His Dark Materials trilogy with doubts, major doubts. I haven't read fantasy in quite some time since getting into adult novels. I used to love fantasy but after a while this entire prophecy thing and the chosen one and blablabla started to annoy me. I wanted enthralling stories, I wanted tension and philosophical notes. I wanted the Great Writing. Kundera, Foer, Brönte, Murakami. They were served to me and I devoured them all with great taste.

2406,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"Pullman was clearly deeply influenced by ""Paradise Lost"", as both the title (""His Dark Materials"") and the themes for the books are taken from Milton's works. I have heard that these books are a source of controversy for Christian groups, and I suppose I can see why, considering the status of death and the afterlife and the existence and relevance of deamons in Pullman's books. However, while the characters struggle against an oppressive church, it is NOT The Creator against which they battle. D"

The Golden Compass: 5 stars. Amazing book. A fantasy book for children and adults. Intelectualy challenging, very creative, with a heroine that captivates the reader with her qualities and flaws. The Subtle Knife: 5 billion stars. One of the best books I've read in my life, with many unforgettable things. Will is one of them. The boy is incredible. Eve"
2410,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"I think I can say without exaggeration that this book has changed my life. I doubt I will ever know or understand all the literary metaphors and references, but I think Pullman himself would say that this doesn't matter. It's a darned good story. It's incredibly rich, complex, and epic. It explores deeper questions about life's meaning, without ever feeling heavy-handed or preachy. It's simpatico with opinions and feelings that I already have (and have had for a long time), but still challenged"

2412,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,"I started reading these books after being told that Harry Potter was intellectually thin compared to Pullman's trilogy. My as of now informed opinion: I don't think that's true. As far as ""philosophy"" goes, Pullman is beating a dead horse and making a show of it, too. But this is not the interesting question, really. It wasn't mind-blowing philosophy that made me fall for Harry Potter but some great characters and a sufficiently intriguing (though often contrived) plot. His Dark Materials didn't"

By the third book Lyra had changed so much and the plot was so convoluted that I really didn't care about the story at all. I also found the books to be quite dark and full of adult themes, considering I found them in the children's section at the library.

I love nothing more than Banned Book Week ( http://www.bannedbooksweek.org/ ) and reading the newest, most hated books there are. Sometimes they are just really bad- the author was trying so hard to goad the audience with sex and violence that it’s not art, it’s just stupid. Despite the fighting warrior polar bears, that is not the case here. These are the most brilliant young adult novels I’ve never read. Never once does it speak"
2415,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"One day I'd like to write something worth justice of this trilogy. Oh my GOD - ha! What a read. What read. What an experience. I swear to GOD -ha! Seriously words at the moment cannot describe the feelings that came from reading these books. I haven't shed more tears ever in my life while reading any other novel, than I did with the last one in this otherworldly trilogy. To know what real love is, pure, unembellished & umblemished, whole, resilient love with a unwavering and unshakable resolve"
2416,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,1,"It was January of 2008 when I was reading these books and it's not nearly July of 2010, so it's reaching a ways back to remember all the reasons I didn't like the books--and indeed, never finished the third book of the trilogy--but it goes a little something like this: 1. I didn't like the writing. Random POV switches in scene, a lot of telling vs. showing, shoddy/inconsistent characterization and poor structure. 2. I didn't like the story. From the overall portrayal/treatment of women to the cla"
2417,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"What a journey. I've had this trilogy on my shelf, unread, for quite a few years but was prompted to start it after reading Pullman's account of a brief, spontaneous transcendental experience as he walked along London's Charing Cross Road many years ago. It gave him, he said, an insight into the interconnectedness and duality of everything, including humans, and said it had informed everything he has written ever since. So I picked His Dark Materials off my self and then couldn't put it down. Th"
2418,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"Basically, the universe is layer upon layer of parallel universes. Lyra can read the Golden Compass which is a highly effective means of answering life's most difficult questions. She goes on Adventures. Will has found the Subtle Knife, which slices apart the universes and allows you travel between them, they go on Adventures together. Dr. Mary -Something- has the Amber Spyglass which allows you to see Dust, which is Dark Matter, which is everywhere, attracts evil spectors and flows between the"
2419,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"I just wasn't the same again once I had read this trilogy. It changed my world view and opened me up to extraordinary possibilities - especially as all of the fantastical elements are based on plausible science. I stumbled over the first couple of chapters, unsure of the voice of the novel, but then I was hooked, and stormed through all three books. Emotionally it took me through the whole gamut and left me with a haunting sense of simultaneous hope and melancholy. Not many books can tackle the"
2420,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"This book has everything I love: multiple universes, magic, daemons, quantum mechanics and particle physics, philosophy, nonhuman creatures, love, you name it. It's hard to explain just how wonderful this book is, just like I assume it's hard to imagine how it could contain all these elements at all. But it does, and it binds them together masterfully, and it is so so beautiful."
2421,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"This is the most moving trilogy of novels I have read. Magical, beautiful and life-affirming. 'His Dark Materials' should be prescribed on the NHS."
2422,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"The chronicles of Narnia for athiests. While at times Pullman can list woefully towards melodromatic prose, as a whole these books are some of the most fantastic fantasy books for young adults ever."
2423,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"There's nothing else I can say about these books except that, simply, they are the best things I've ever read."
2424,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,i really enjoyed these books. the author some huge stabs at religon/god. NOT for young readers.
2425,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,Review to come soon.
2426,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,3,"the first book is GREAT, the second one ok, and the third one dont bother!!"
2427,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"Review originally published here: http://girlwithherheadinabook.co.uk/2... His Dark Materials was originally published as three separate books, of which I first read The Northern Lights as an eleven year old, then stumbled over The Subtle Knife the following year. It was not until I was fourteen that I read The Amber Spyglass although Pullman apparently always envisaged the trilogy as one unit. Almost from the very first page of the very first book, the story instantly became one of my very favou"
2428,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,"Original review posted here I had these books as a child and adored them, though I’ll admit it took a while to get into them. I distinctly remember reading the first page of Northern Lights and putting the book down, deciding it was boring. Luckily I got past that and it was one of my favourite series for a long time. My copies of the books are pretty battered and last year Nathan bought me a beautiful edition of all three stories and I thought the Rereadathon was the perfect time to read it. Nort"
2430,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"THE GOLDEN COMPASS Originally posted at: https://iliveforreading.blogspot.com/... It's been FOREVER since I'd read The Golden Compass, and reading it for the second time just made me love it even more! When I was invited to join the blog tour I jumped at the opportunity because this was the perfect excuse to dive into a childhood favourite. I've never actually read the whole His Dark Materials series–I've only read The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife–and hopefully this gives me a chance to fin"
2432,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,3,"Ok the bff is late so I have some time to get this done. This book was overall not bad, it was just not what I wanted it to be. I’ve watched the movie like hundreds times and I loved the world, I loved the daemons and I still find the idea very fascinating, but at the end I didn’t feel satisfied with anything. Let’s take a look at the books separately So The golden compass I find this book to be the most interesting of the three. It’s when you get to know the world and the characters and all was g"
2433,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,"Hmmm! loved it ... mostly. It was well written and enjoyable to read. Mr Pullman clearly understand religious philosophies and the doctrine of the Catholic Church to have so neatly woven it into different shapes from different versions of the stories realities. The biblical references explaining daemons in Lyra’s world is cleverly inventive, add to that the whole viewpoint of any religious zealots and it’s quite frightening, and easy to see how the human race can get itself into the mess we are"
2434,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"My first read of 2018 was a reread. His Dark Materials is an incredible piece of work, the structure, characterisation, and sheer depth of the thing always staggers me. I've read the trilogy three or four times in total since release and each time I come away with nothing but respect and admiration for Pullman. At its heart is a love story and I can claim romance research with each reread but really it's just tremendous fun and a great story. The heroine learns and grows and is a strong female l"
2435,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,3,"I just read the His Dark Materials (a.k.a. The Golden Compass) trilogy. There will be spoilers here. If you are an easily-offended Christian...heck, if you are a somewhat-difficult-to-offend Christian, you probably don't want to read these. I didn't see the movie, and I knew nearly nothing about the series going into it beyond the idea of daemons (from the cool meme on the movie site) and armored polar bears. Even before reading the Acknowledgments at the back of the trilogy, I could tell that his"
2436,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"When I was a teenager I used to reread my favorite books all over again. Not now because of fear to miss the really good new ones. But after finishing ""The book of dust"" I couldn’t help it and started rereading ""His dark materials"". When I had been reading this trilogy 10 years ago I couldn’t get it - was Pullman’s writing skilled or it was just fascinating story to follow. I guess it’s all about translation thing because now I can say for sure - he is a brilliant writer indeed. I spent 52 hours"
2437,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,Aah. The child in me absolutely loved these books. I really wish I'd found them when I was younger. They would definitely top Potter world for me. But reading them as an adult was still extremely enjoyable and meaningful. They're definitely not kiddie books but rather YA sci-fi. The kind of books that provide deep emotional and spiritual sustenance.
2438,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,3,"Plot Summary Young Lyra finds herself in the midst of a controversy that sparks a war between all existent universes, a war in which the common understanding of sin is challenged and in which the rebels pit themselves against God himself to end death and bring about a new sense of balance to existence. Initial Thoughts The story is really entertaining. It really is. But it’s pretty much impossible to immerse yourself fully in the story, because throughout the series Pullman seems to have quite an"
2439,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"A master-work in modern fantasy. The Amber Spyglass is perhaps less good than the others, but this is massively made up for by the sheer need to see the story through that was laid out in the Northern Lights and the Subtle Knife."
2440,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,First book done. Decided to mark as read as it gave me the heebie-jeebies to have as currently reading :) Will probably continue later on.
2441,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,Fabulous books!
2442,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,It's 4 am. I'm absolutely heartbroken. What more can I say?
2443,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"And, and, and, I am done. Here is my blog on the book: https://newfracturedlight.wordpress.c..."
2444,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,Unforgivable that i'd left it this long to read this trilogy! Full review to come.
2445,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"O man, if only this book were five times as long - I can't believe I finished it already. I loved it so much!"
2446,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,This is my second time reading the trilogy and I enjoyed it as much as first time around over 10 years ago. Love the charcters development and the different worlds set up.
2447,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,"What a story... what a book. Intense, addicting, beautiful. The beginning got me hooked immediately and the ending made a great impression on me."
2449,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,3,The first 2 books in this trilogy are brilliant. 5/5 stars. However the final book in the trilogy let it down as it dragged a lot.
2450,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"WHY have I only JUST discovered this magical fantasy world of wonder, on par with the marvellous world of HP and LOTRs? Where have you been hiding? Or rather, where have I been hiding...... Under a rock obviously"
2451,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,"The idea behind the novels is that there is not just one world but multiple, uncountable multiples, of worlds. In 11 year old Lyra's world, the setting for The Golden Compass , many things are very similar but the major difference is that the spirits of all people are separate from their bodies, in animal form. They are called daemons, and are constant, close, ever-loving, ever-loyal companions. This is a very intrinsic part of the story, and also one of the more interesting fantasy tropes of rec"
2454,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,"The Golden Compass: 3 stars It's been a long time since I read a fantasy work that felt so original to me in terms of world-building. That's not to say that every aspect considered separately is new--the technology level described here is basically steampunk, even if it's missing the usual trappings--but the combination of everything produced an ambience, an aesthetic, that felt fresh and interesting. I also loved the deconstructionist theme--question everything, don't trust adults simply because"
2455,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"Paradise won His Dark Materials is a significant literary achievement. It is some way from perfection, but when it succeeds it does so massively. When it fails it is more often than not the result of forgiveable over-ambitiousness. It has rightly come to be seen as a young person's classic and a work which can stand alongside the two other great Oxford fantasies set in Middle Earth and Narnia. The first book, the Northern Lights, tells the story of Lyra, who has been brought up in an Oxford colleg"
2456,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,"Up front, His Dark Materials is a saga that asks a lot of you, and it's one that needs to be read one right after the other. It's a series that deserves to be infused with your own emotions as well as your undivided attention. Despite the fact that there are many fantastical elements to this saga, the many themes presented therein are ones that can easily be translated into our own worlds, ready for us to decipher and unlock as we discover them. Even though these books were written for the young"
2457,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,3,"I gave this trilogy 3 stars because whilst the first two books are excellent the 3rd book is terrible. It is a morass of plot holes so large, ocean liners could get lost in it. It seemed that Pullman completely ignored writing a decent story just so he could get to his 'message' 1.In Ci'gazze we are told that spectres attack any adult, it happens to the witches hunting Lyra yet when Mrs Coulter turns up, they leave her alone and not just alone, they follow her orders. We are not told why this hap"
2458,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,"that's right, punks. i bought the original, british, unchanged-by-stupid-american-publishers-for-no-apparent-reason trilogy. and it continues to be an uphill battle since the lovely american postal system lost my first copy, and amazon uk was gracious enough to send me another one free of charge. i expect a very american rabid dog who has broken free of its rabidly patriotic owner to come grab the book out of my hand as soon as i try to read it, such is this country's resistance to me reading th"
2459,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,1,"The only thing I knew about ""His Dark Materials"" when I began reading the series, was that there was a movie coming out soon and I wanted to read the books first. Let me tell you, that was not enough information! Please read a bit of background on these books before reading them or before your dependents read them so that you can answer their questions. I was unprepared going into these books for some of the directions Pullman chose to take the story, and was therefore often left feeling uncomfo"
2460,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"Where to start... This was an undertaking for sure. I had tried to start The Golden Compass on probably 4 different occasions and just could not get further than a few chapters in. This time, I was determined to finish the whole trilogy so I could read Pullman's upcoming book ""The Book of Dust"" and damn... what a ride! Now I had a lot of background going into this because of the history behind it as an almost response to Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia. Pullman, an outspoken atheist, thought that Lewi"
2461,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,3,"My God was I let down by these books. When I read Northern Lights I was enchanted. The concept of demons, a great setting, and a world unlike any Fantasy world I'd ever visited. Not to mention spunky Lyra, and her cool allies. Like the Gypsians. And Iorek. And the witches. And what villains! Both Asriel and Coulter are detestable. And yet understandable and finely drawn. So I was in a world unlike any post- Lord of the Rings fantasy. Full of promise, and a great heroine... But the series went from"
2462,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,"Wow, this book was so much worse than I thought it would be - and I really tried to like it. What struck me most was how utterly boring and unrelatable the protagonist „Lyra“ was and how quick she was to declare her friendship and love. At one point of the story, the author stresses so much on how Lyra „loved and trusted“ the big polar bear, that I was seriously starting to wonder, if she had a crush on the bear. It all seemed very unnatural and forced, since the bear was not a very compelling c"
2463,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,"I had been under the impression that this book was targeting young adults. Maybe I was misled by the movie (which definitely marketed to kids), but the content of this book was sufficiently adult, and some pretty terrible things happened to kids, things that I think I would have found really disturbing as a kid or even young adult, and which I found relatively disturbing now. However, the fact that I *thought* this was a young adult book made me compare it to books I read as a pre-teen. On the w"
2464,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,3,"Pfft... What was that? So disappointing. The books started on a rising note, and kept rising and rising, into a crescendo, and then when it was at its peak it seemed to have suddenly lost its wings - swooping in hither and dither, before falling with a big thud. It feels like the writer just grew wary of the story, or just fell out of love with it. The loose threads weren't just left untended, they were frayed into multiple other threads before a tiny one of them was picked up and it was decided"
2465,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"I read this series (or novel in 3 parts) for the first time when I was 30. Six years later, it is just as atom-splittingly astounding. I don't know how anyone under the age of 25 can read this series and not become incapacitated with wonder. I'm just barely holding on. The warning CS Lewis rebuffs in his essay 'On Fairy Stories,' that children who read fantasy stories may come to resent the real world for not being magical, could possibly be true in the case of reading His Dark Materials. If you"
2467,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"There's not a whole lot of new stuff I can really say about this book. It's still one of my absolute all time favorites, and in fact I probably love it even more now after my most recent reread. The stuff with the world of the dead is beautiful and such a good message to send - that people need to focus on having experiences in the here and now, rather than worrying about after. It's a lovely fantasized version of the atheist view of life and death. The concept of Dust is also wonderful, and the"
2469,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"I cannot say enough good things about this trilogy. I decided to read The Golden Compass because I thought it was a kids’ book, and I needed something light. I still haven’t quite figured out if this series was written for adults or kids, or both, but it doesn’t matter because I think anyone would love the main characters (a 12-year-old girl and boy), and the story is enthralling no matter how old you are. It is more captivating and imaginative than the Chronicles of Narnia, yet, unlike the Lord"
2470,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,"I was curious about this book since it was warned against by a lot of Christians, and the last book they warned against ( Harry Potter ) actually turned out not only to not lead children directly to the devil, but also to be a pretty good story. His Dark Materials (which is really one story, though originally released as a trilogy starting with The Golden Compass ). It is written as a children's book but I would not recommend it for children until they are mature enough to grapple with heavy topics"
2471,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"If I hadn't already read these when the flurry of panicked emails went around when The Golden Compass hit the big screen, I would have rushed out and done it just out of spite. As it was, I already knew the books were fabulous. I have a vague memory of reading them on a picnic table up on Cedar Mountain in the summer. I read them again this summer and the pleasure was only slightly lessened by the fact that I already knew what was going to happen. When I compare the talent of Pullman to most othe"
2472,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"This year marked my fourth reread of the His Dark Materials Trilogy , in readiness for La Belle Sauvage , which I excitedly queued up for in Waterstones last Autumn (I'd not been in a queue for a specific book since Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , and I was equally anticipant!). I wanted to gather my thoughts before breaking new ground in the multiverse Phillip Pullman created. The trilogy has been a favourite of mine since my first frenzied read over half my life ago. My edition is a 1000+ p"
2473,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,"Ok - i've heard a lot about this series. And one of my friends dragged me to the golden compass movie, which i enjoyed... So i was intrigued enough to get ahold of the books. I liked The Golden Compass. I thought it followed the movie (or the movie followed the book) very well. The places where they changed things around (mostly switching the order of events) seemed reasonable, the story was entertaining, it flowed well, etc.. The other two weren't nearly as good. If the first one was a 4 star boo"
2474,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"It took me quite a while to read this. Not only is it pretty long, but I read it aloud most nights to my daughter, and we were both captivated. Plenty has already been said about the novel's anti-religious message. I'd just add that the novel's message is basically that we should be good to each other, seek the truth, and rebel against cruel and tyrannical hierarchies. I can see why religious authorities are upset by it. The series is very inventive. Not content to create one world, Pullman creat"
2475,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,"I have read the first book in the trilogy and I don't understand the hype. It's the story of a little girl, who is always in trouble. It reminded me of the comments about the LotR movies. It is the story of a girl that goes from one place to another. And for a ""practical girl, with no imagination"" Lyra is a damn good liar and story teller... I think I'll read the other books, but only because I'm obsessed with collections and I already have them in my bookshelf. I finished the second book. I think i"
2476,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,"There were some ideas in this series I liked. I loved the notion of the daemons, and the talking bears were kinda cool. I liked the interconnected worlds, and I thought the trip to the Underworld was a pretty interesting and unique take. And the alethiometer was a pretty cool device - tho I think that rationale for why Lyra could and then couldn't read it was something of a cop-out, especially since the same rationale didn't hold true for others. But there were so many other things about the seri"
2477,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,"Lyra is a spirited, freethinking young girl in a fantastical world where (big surprise) freethinking isn't exactly a good thing. It took me a while to get into this book. In fact, it wasn't until I found out what was being done to the young children that were disappearing that I hit that can't-put-the-book-down point. Overall I liked the book. I'm glad I didn't read it when it first came out though, because there are way too many cliffhangers. I've read a lot of the reviews that say the book is an"
2478,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,3,"The first book (The Golden Compass) is captivating! One of those page-turners indeed. Not only the setting (modern era, but no Church Reformation ever occured) is enthralling, but also the characters. My fave is Iorek Byrnison, a brave, noble, armored-bear. I think what makes this book a bit different with other fantasy flicks is its reference to physics as well as religion. I read that Pullman probably uses Milton's Paradise Lost as his main inspiration. The second book, unfortunately, is not as"
2479,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,"I don't think of HDM as a children's story, I am calling it YA because that's closer to where I think you should be when reading this trilogy. I think the ability to think critically and understand more complex themes is important here. It is an engaging adventure story, but it also speaks heavily to themes of theology and religion, good vs evil, ignorance vs wisdom, corruption vs grace, etc. There's a lot of talk about HDM being anti-Christian, and as a Christian reader I can see where certain"
2480,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,3,"I really liked the first one, but as the series went on, it got harder for me to like. Mostly because it makes me sad that he is so angry at God that he depicts him as a usurping, power-grabbing being in the same category as the rest of us evolved, conscious beings. And through the centuries and millenia, God became older and more decrepit, finally being carried out on a stretcher by an enemy and dying. That picture is so sad to me. And one disturbing literary device is the constant back-and-for"

Join her as she journeys through unknown worlds completely different from her own while meeting new friends as well as enemies, countering lies with secrets, and discovering the truth in “His Dark Materials” by Phillip Pullman.

2482,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,3,"The Golden Compass: Five stars This first book in the series is an absolute page-turner. Pullman shapes a truly unique story centered around a precocious child and her best friend, a daemon, who seems to be a physical manifestation of a piece of her own soul. Lyra is a young girl in a world of stuffy male scholars, who takes turns trying to educate her. Her Uncle Asriel has left her in this situation but occasionally drops in to check her progress and converse with the scholars. On one of his ret"
2483,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,"Only finished The Golden Compass and still deciding whether I'm going to power through the other two books. Though the story is interesting and the theme is provoking, this really represents what I don't like about fantasy. As much effort that has been poured into creating a new world, the characters within the world are flat, rigid archetypes. Its like their is a Tolkien/C.S. Lewis character store where writers can get cardboard cut-outs of fantasy characters, rename them and wedge them into ne"
2484,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,"His Dark Materials is definitively a series that needs to be read together. The Golden Compass is definitely a ""first book"" - while it does have a beginning and end of it's own contained adventure, it also has a lot of world building set-up that you need to keep reading to get more information on. The Subtle Knife felt like a filler book. The Subtle Knife (the item in the book) is an important piece of the overall puzzle and I understood why it had it's own book but I wish more of the overall plo"
2485,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"This book took me to another world. And then another world, and then another one... The imagination of the author is so impressive and the characters are complex, interesting, and very entertaining. This may technically be a children's book, but it's truly timeless and I recommend it to people of all ages. Lyra is my heroine! I'm still working out my reflections of this book on a religious and spiritual level. I had read that the author was an atheist and was afraid he might bash God. It is more"
2486,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,I admit it - I bought this trilogy because I was excited by the movie preview and I am generally a fan of sci-fi/fantasy adventures. But by the end I found myself wondering why I had so strongly recommended it to my friends. Well here's why: 1) Pullman is good at crafting a story - the suspense of the first book is almost tangible and it is hard to put it down after starting. 2) There is so much potential in the way it appears he will deal with quantum theory that it piqued the philosopher in me
2487,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,"While this book is intended for young adults, I found the writing to be well enough and the story telling masterful enough to see the entire trilogy through in a short span of time. The young adult parts of the story can be irking; protagonists who are actually adults in everything but their stated age, adults who are children in everything but their age, overly emotional dialogs and a large percentage of the events happen at the edge of the figurative precipice to keep the reader at their edge o"
2488,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,"Ok.. I wish they had broken this trilogy up into three separate books on this site so I could rate them accordingly. The first book was really good. I really enjoyed it and I am glad I read it after I saw the movie. That way I got to enjoy both. The second book started off with a bang and held on to me for a while but by the end it had sunk to a new low. I'm not even excited about continuing the story. All the atheism aside, I feel like Pullman created a beautiful world with very endearing chara"
2489,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,1,"I started reading this book (and went and saw the movie) because Pullman wanted to write a book that was better than Middle Earth or Narnia (esp. Narnia) because he hates those stories. So I went and bought the paperback 3-in-1 trilogy. Here's my analysis: not interesting enough to keep reading after I lost interest after the third chapter or so of the second book in the series...whatever the reviews in the front say, or whatever the author himself says, that it's in the same league as Tolkien o"
2490,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,3,"I think this trilogy might have received a higher rating from me if I were younger. I've loved fantasy and science fiction all my life, and as a teen I would have appreciated the fucking cray-cray of this storyline, but it was so out there! Lyra and Will go on an outrageous journey, meet outlandish creatures/characters, speak of quantum physics and other shit, and deal with the land of the dead. By the end, I was over it. I read all three back to back, and by completion, I wanted to strangle the"
2491,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,3,"Just finished this last night. Was curious after seeing the (awful) movie about the author's take on atheism and a trilogy of books where someone sets out to kill god. The first book, The Golden Compass, was promising enough that I decided to keep on going. Nice use of language, overall plot and pacing not bad. While the books seem to be building to a climax, the battle against ""God"" is an anti-climax. God, or The Authority, is an aging pretender to the title who was not the real creator of the al"
2492,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"I truly enjoyed these books, racing through them to capture the story and maybe to absorb the larger themes and metaphors. In particular, I liked how the story and its complexity continued to build throughout the books. Admittedly, I was thinking that the books were building towards a climactic battle, similar to Tolkien's ""Battle of the Pelennor Fields"" (which we all know isn't the end of things). Quite simply put, that didn't happen at all, and was barely a blip in the storyline (and, so was t"
2493,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,1,"The ultra-conservative right-wingers are correct on this one! I am not very conservative with what I read. I enjoy a wide variety of books and, for example, am not the least bit bothered by the 'witchcraft' in Harry Potter. I do pre-read my children's books, and these were some that my oldest was interested in, so I got reading. I cannot recommend them, at all. For one thing, the sheer tedium of these books has made it so I can't even finish the third book. I love to read, but as soon as I pick up"
2494,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,"I read these before there was the controversy about the Athiest views of Phillip Pullman. I feel that any piece of literature can be worked over from lots of different views and come to just as many assorted conclusions. I didn't know that Pullman was an Athiest and therefore did not work that into my perception of the story as I read. Of course, I could get a completely different take on it reading it a second time around with his claims about what he wanted the books to do. There were parts o"
2495,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"Incredible. It was described to me by a co-worker, Laurence Campling, as something to read when you're ready to grow up from Harry Potter. He was underselling it. His Dark Materials is an incredible exercise in physics, fantasy, philosophy, and above all, storytelling. The alternate worlds are breathtaking in their specificity as if Mr. Pullman has been there. The thoughts and motivations of the characters are deep and real. The situations and decisions faced are never easy and never simple. There"
2496,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,1,"Although the first book in the trilogy was engaging, I am now (and have been for months) stuck in the last book of the trilogy. After reading others' reviews, I am ready to stop blaming myself for my inability to pick the book back up and finish it. The last book in the series is rather awful! There are many really imaginative devices and characters in these books, and I have definitely been drawn to Lyra through the first two books. I'm disappointed that Lyra turned from a fiercely independent"
2497,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,"I decided to read this book because it appeared to be of the same genre as Harry Potter, which I do enjoy. I am a fantasy gamer always looking for a new idea. This book has some good ones. If Mr. Pullman had left out his dislike of Christianity and hatred of the Catholic Church from this book it would have been a good series. As it is his random shots at Church policies, dishonesty and vagaries ruined much of the story for me. I finished this series because I hate to leave a series unfinished and"
2498,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,"The first two novels are incredible and very well written. The story is very original and his descriptions of super-natural events make it so real. I would've given them five stars except the last book seemed too jumbled, preachy, and abstract for my taste. I don't care what he says about it being a fantasy world with fantasy villians, his disdain for God and those that believe in him comes accross very vividly in his trilogy. Of course Pullman is intitled to freedom of press (as well as opinions)"
2499,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,"Having recently read Paradise Lost, upon which this is loosely based, I wondered why it has been taken as anti-religion. Paradise Lost has never been accused of that, so I suspect that His Dark Materials has been wrongly aspersed. Ultimately the message seemed to be that it really doesn't matter who's in charge, they're all just as bad as each other. Treating it as purely something to read without going an awful lot into its message - and I'm of the view that it's best not to take too many messa"
2500,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,"Towards the latter portion of the trilogy, Pullman spends too much time yelling ""God is evil"" at the reader and forgets to expand and revist the unique worlds he created in the beginning of the trilogy. With a name like ""His Dark Materials"" I think I expected something with more fantasy, magic and power. A compass, knife and spyglass don't really seem like ""dark materials"" to me, even if they do run on ""Dust"" (or ""Sin"", or whatever Dust is supposed to be). I am not even sure if those items are s"
2501,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,Oh God.. yeah that'll be so funny in the context of the book. I'm really confused-I really can't diside if reading His Dark Materials 4 years ago - when I was Lyra and Will's age would be better. One thing for sure: this book (not books :D) kicks so much ass. The three parts are completely different from eachother but they flow so well together; the plot is totally bonkers but the amazing characters make it so real and natural also this is the first book i have read with such strong religious th
2502,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"These books are very dear to me. The first time I read them, I finished the last one lying on the beach in Phuket, the day before the Boxing Day tsunami destroyed the entire beach. I always think of that day and the next day and Lyra and all the souls (I won't say anymore!) The second time I read them I was disappointed in myself for letting myself read them again because the end is so...distressing? I get so invested in the story, I love and hate the ending and I always wondered if he'd continue"
2503,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,"First let me say that I think Phillip Pullman is a very gifted writer who has created a beautiful fantasy world that I enjoyed visiting. But, man, this guy is ANGRY at God and the church. It just seethes. Anger just oozing off the pages. Then at the end, he kills God outright. Which I thought was weird and obviously some sort of strange agenda... I mean, why not just create a fantasy world WITHOUT God? Why bring it up at all? I am totally anti-censorship, and my parents let me read anything and ev"
2504,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,3,"Reviewing all of these at once is probably easier. The first book - GREAT I was hungry for more. The second book - pretty good, I was still interested. And he did some unexpected things in the 2nd book. It had parts though, that were just too much. The third book - no I didn't like it. The religion or anti religion hurt the story. It doesn't bother me that it's anti catholic, it bothered me that he let it hurt the story. That's just my opinion, I bet others will disagree and more power to you for"
2505,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,What a great series to read! Lyra makes a great a girl hero - and I will have to have my daughter read it. A total page turner... I am currently reading the last half of the last book in the series and am still wondering what problems the church might have had with this - as I only noticed this series because of warnings from the religious right... Of course it questions the bible's view of god and creation and the role of the church.... The last book seems to hurry through tying up strands of the
2506,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,"The Golden Compass is easily my favorite of the trilogy. I sat in my car in the parking lot reading the last chapter, because I couldn't wait until I got home to finish it. Lyra is a great character, and she really shines in this book. The Subtle Knife is next in my order of preference. We get to meet Will and we jump between worlds, but he isn't quite as compelling a character as Lyra. A word of caution: this book ends in a horrible cliffhanger, so have the last book handy. The Amber Spyglass was"
2507,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,"First book: 5 stars Second book: 4 or 5 stars Third Book: 4 stars Pullman pulls out the bucket o' weird and just dumps it all over book 3. It works, but it's borderline. Through books one and two it's all ""Yaaaaay happy fun young adult fantasy novel! Dark themes! FIGHTING BEARS! NO LOVE TRIANGLES. NO LOVE TRIANGLES. NO FUCKING LOVE TRIANGLES!!"" Then you get to book three and it's kind of ""Oh. Well, this is kind of sci-fi now, isn't it? Was not prepared for this. Weird."" That and I'm not crazy about"
2508,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,"The first book, The Golden Compass, is pretty much one of my favorite books of all time. So there's that. But the latter two books in the series never really live up to the first, in my opinion, which is upsetting. They're still thrilling reads, and the world(s) Pullman has created are fantastical and gorgeously written, but his super obvious anti-religious/anti-church/anti-God agenda (especially in The Amber Spyglass) is a little too blatant for me to continue to enjoy the books as an adult (I"
2509,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"Pullmans 'His Dark Materials Trilogy' is undoubtedly one of the greatest children s stories ever told, and like all great works of literature, it also speaks to an audience of all ages. On the surface this is a tale of adventure and danger from a child's perspective, but scratch the surface and suddenly you are submerged in one of the great philosophical works of our time. That Pullman can so expertly wrap this in an enjoyable and original children s work that rivals 'Harry Potter' for sheer c"
2510,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"I never read this book when I was younger. I was just too old to know about it, until now. I read all three at once, on my kindle. The first thing I read on it! I think it might be a bit better to put some books in between each one, because these aren't really kids books, they have a lot to think about and are very heavy. The first book was my favorite. There was a movie some years ago about the first book, which is how I even found out about this book. The book's better and the movie was great."
2511,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,"A long and complex story that I'm not sure I understood completely. I listened to this trilogy over the last nine months or so and greatly enjoyed the performances given. The depth of the characters, the worlds they explore, the forces at play, and the overall themes throughout the book makes this quite a compelling read. That having been said, as with many who attempt large writings of analogy to make a particular point, the complexity of the foundations is often overshadowed by the simplicity"
2512,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,"I really, REALLY enjoyed this trilogy. I've been reading a great deal of children's literature and so far this is my favorite. I only had one problem and that was a missing element in the ending. Basically, a key character/plot point was discussed throughout the three books, but never seemed to come to fruition. If it did, it was so subtle that I overlooked it. However, that aside, it is still worth the read. This book takes you on a gripping, epic adventure while asking you to consider the truth"
2513,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,"My friend Stan raved about this trilogy. It was wonderful and I should read it. I started it with good intentions, and the first book was solid. Good story. Believable characters. But in the second novel, the author's agenda started to get in the way. And by the third novel, I was so annoyed at the author's preaching, that the romantic tragedy lost it's effect. I wanted to be sad for the characters, but I was too angry with the author. This is definitely a case where the author's personal views"
2514,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,1,"I thought this trilogy was disturbing in both intent and content. I read it because I wanted to defy the Right Wing boycott, and I had to force myself to finish the 3rd installment (i.e. push through boredom & lethargy). It's hard to discern why these are marketed to children/tweens because they're really just poorly written pages of words, whose hateful subtlety is directed at other like-minded adults and would be lost on kids anyway. Mostly, I've never read a book and felt that much despai"
2515,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,"Loved, loved, loved it! I was transported to another world with daemons and witches and Iorek Byrnison. I imagined myself as a child to be Lyra Silvertongue. It is just a wonderful, magical and vivid adventure. I couldn't put it down, and when I was finished I immediately picked up the second book in the series...and when I finished that one, while at work, I called my girlfriend to get the third from our neighbor (who was reading them just ahead of me). I did find the ending to be a bit disappo"
2516,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,1,"I hate this series with a passion. It wasn't fun. It didn't go anywhere. There was absolutely no closure whatsoever. In the end, not only are the children robbed of the element that made them special in order for an author to make some stupid, self aggrandizing, childish, senselessly vindictive point, but the young couple is forced apart for the same exact idiotic reason. For these reasons and many others, I will never read this author/series ever again. I despise authors who forget one of the pr"
2517,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,1,I stayed far away from the controversy surrounding Pullman before I read these books. I wanted to judge the books on their merit alone and not be influenced by pop culture and opinion pieces. Having said that….. I’ll save everyone the long winded diatribe I’d like to write here and just say that the time I spent reading this book ranks among the top 5 in my “biggest wastes of time” list. I will never get that time back. I HATED this entire series. I choked it down because I can’t bear to leave a
2518,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,"Having heard so many good things, I really wanted to like this series, and for most of book #1 I did. The premise is interesting, the world-building and detail are original, and Lyra is a likable heroine. By the end of book #1, however, the plot is starting to fall apart. In books #2 and #3, Pullman's message has run away with him and overwhelmed plot and character entirely. I don't have a problem with his anti-organized-religion stance itself, or with wanting to send that message to teens via a"
2519,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"I won't cheat and write three different reviews for each of these books. Instead I shall treat them as one. The story of Lyra and her world is incredibly rich with each character in each of the books treated individually giving them an amazing depth that is so often neglected in other children's books. The themes too are not just about the classic good versus evil which is a staple of the genre in this new age of children's literature, but instead require the reader to look beyond the two dimens"
2520,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"Maybe some day I'd be able to get my thoughts together, sit down and write a proper review for His Dark Materials , but having just finished the trilogy, one word comes to mind to describe it: monumental. It's an epic piece of literature that every child needs to read before growing up--I'm only sorry I didn't really know about it when I was at the right age--I would have been thoroughly addicted. It's a fine amalgam of fantasy, spirituality, science and coming-of-age romance that would undoubted"
2521,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,1,"don't waste your time!!! horrible books. Young reader level suggestion. No young readers would totally get this series fo books. So, so dark and the adult characters a pure evil. If you enjoy adults killing children knck yourself out. I read them because the movie looked good and I wanted to read them before it came out. I read all three because i wanted to know how it all worked out, but didn't enjoy reading them at all. don't let the movie fool you, the books are nothing like the movie (as usu"
2522,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"This trilogy was nothing short of amazing, for me anyway, but I have to be honest: Normally, when religious fanatics decry something with language like ""trying to preach an atheistic message,"" I would say that the critics are wildly overreacting. In this case, though, it's more than atheism: Without giving too much away, the god of Abraham (Yahweh, YHWH, Jehovah, ""just call me God""), does exist, and is malevolent. If you're a Christian, chances are you're not going to want to support this franchi"
2523,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"I still can't believe I read these as a kid. The amount of quantum EVERYTHING in them blew my adult mind, so I'm not even sure how my kid mind handled them. What a wonderful way to introduce those concepts, though! Setting them into an active story makes them so much more tangible and understandable. Quantum entanglement, particle physics, string theory, parallel universes... not to mention a brilliant plot and incredibly imaginative and vivid writing. I could not recommend these books enough."
2524,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,"An incredible series that goes straight to the heart of what makes us human. There's no pussyfooting around here; these books are an elegant look at desire, morality and the soul, topics which are usually skirted around in contemporary novels. (I found the ending of the series to be a touch disappointing, but considering the overall quality of the books my expectations were perhaps too high; endings are hard to pull off.) As much as I love Harry Potter, it's a shame these didn't get the worldwid"
2525,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"A brilliant trilogy which i got so into (especially during the Subtle knife) and couldn't put down during the third book. I grew so attached to the characters and so immersed in the story line, that i just couldn't stop reading. It has been a while since i have read them and i look forward to coming back to this amazing trilogy in the future! I recommend these books to anyone who is interested because they really are something you don't want to miss. Less Scoresby will always be my favourite cha"
2526,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,1,"His Dark Materials is a trilogy consisting of three titles: * The Golden Compass * The Subtle Knife * The Amber Spyglass No books are ever written in a vacuum. Ultimately, they reflect the moral or philosophical ideas of the author--sometimes blatantly stated and other times subtly implanted. In His Dark Materials, God is an impostor of the worst type - a created being claiming to be the creator. He has deceived the entire ""multiuniverse,"" which has now been torn apart by dangerous people using d"
2527,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"Yeah, I don't remember God dying in these books. I read them all. It got a bunch of fuss in the press over it. From what I understood, it was Lucifer that died. I thought. Yeah, the ending was sort of confusing. And the angel Xaphania is a bitch. Seriously. That having been said, I love the hell out of these books. The movie is probably subpar. But the books are exquisite and deep and metaphorical and wondrous. It makes me squeal that they have received the attention that they have."
2528,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,"If asked to review The Golden Compass , my opinion would be much different than it is toward the trilogy. The first book was interesting, rich, and compelling...but after that it goes downhill. The Subtle Knife is still pretty good, but The Amber Spyglass became awkward and overbearing. It felt like being force-fed some grand perception of an imaginary universe, even though it left plot holes gaping wide and the whole idea of a compelling story in the dust. I wasn't satisfied at the end."
2529,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,"I know everyone just LOVED this trilogy, and they couldn't get ENOUGH. So much that it just HAD to be made into a movie. I am sorry, but I really did not see what all the fuss was about. And frankly, I found the little girl, Lyra, to be quite annoying, especially in ""The Golden Compass."" I found it to be extremely slow reading, and to be very honest with you I forced myself to keep reading, but I just could not do it toward the end, and so gave up with probably only 50 pages or so left to read."
2530,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,"Sorry guys, but this trilogy just doesn't do it for me. I was well aware of the anti-God message the author was attempting to push out before I even began the reading; it was the the writing itself that I found disappointing. There was simply too much flitting around from one world to another, trying to sum up a great understanding of what it all meant to the main character. The first two books ended horribly, leaving the reader with no resolution to probems they came across in the reading and fr"
2531,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,1,"There's a reason I couldn't even get through Northern Lights in two months. I'm sorry, but this just wasn't interesting or well written. It was full of exposition. The ""Chosen One"" protagonists are always the dullest, because there's never any suspense or intrigue around their narrative. You know everything is going to work out fine for them. They're only as interesting as the events and characters happening around them (see Jon Snow/Daenerys). Again, I think this is my fault for choosing YA whe"
2532,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,1,"Pullman's writing could be described as flavorful and entertaining in The Golden Compass. It was a steep and downward slope from there. The idea of our souls displaced outside of us and being given a visual identity is creative. The idea of a knife that cuts through planes is not new, but still fascinating. The rest was junk. This series is the product of a man who was deeply hurt by religion and wants to destroy it. The author's sulking made the books intolerable - but I finished them anyway. D"
2533,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,1,"Philip Pullman, I'm deeply unimpressed. I read your trilogy, I got attached to Lyra and Will, just to see you fuck up their lives in a final plot that was as unnecessary as it was incomplete. dafuq happened to the prophecy, dafuq happened with these 2 lovable characters who we have no closure for? had u spent half the time on character development that you did on criticizing Christianity we wouldn't be making this rant. shame on you for making me love 2 characters and then abandoning them like n"
2534,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Golden Compass, and cannot wait to read the rest of the trilogy..... That said, given the buildup, I was a wee bit dissappointed. Ok - months later, I'm reading the Subtle Knife, and find it captivating. I can't put it down - well obviously I can or I'd be done by now! But it's great. I finished the Subtle Knife - I liked it better even than the Golden Compass! I can't wait to read the next one!"
2535,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,"4.5/5 Stars I have this belief that 90% of the time, standalone high fantasy just won’t satisfy me. I still stand by it, but Tigana luckily is not one of those cases. Memories and names, something that breathes life into the people and possessions we lost. Both of these can be summed up as the fabric of identity. Despite all the war, deaths, sex, hardships, betrayal, magic, deception, subterfuge, the main essence of Tigana is reclaiming your freedom, home, memories and the implication of holding"

And I think that maybe our youth is the only time that we can hold simple, firm convictions. Maybe it’s the only time that it’s possible to believe completely that love will conquer all, or that there are good guys and bad guys, or that if we try hard enough, we can achieve anything we dream about. In our youth, we can say things like, “ I would ne"

So if you stumble upon it, give it a try, chances are you'll find it awesome. So.. what didn't I like about it? Well, pretty much everything. This book, in short, tells about the vengeful crusade of a group of refugees from the once-great city of Tigana, destroyed years before by the mage Brandin. Cool, uh? Nope.

2540,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,"The greatest strength of Tigana -- Guy Gavriel Kay 's masterpiece -- is the ""ambiguity"" of his characters' ethics. Fantasy, as a genre, suffers from the widespread simplicity of its expressions of good and evil. Kay consistently transcends this genre weakness, and Tigana marks his first and greatest break with the good vs. evil tradition. Tigana is full of characters who struggle with their decisions and the impact those decisions have on others. Alessan, the ""hero"" of the piece, enslaves a wizar"

I think, just as most everyone else has done, I have to begin with the style of writing. It is a throwback to a time long past, it carries a lyrical magic which simmers in every sentence, and without being in itself overly flowery, it conveyed a sense of Gothic melodrama, which made me feel as if a bard of old was telling the story of"

Guy Gavriel Kay is a great prose writer. It doesn't even matter if fantasy isn't your thing because this book does not read like fantasy. It reads like the sort of well-written historical fiction that weaves in myths to tell the tales of a lost time. A personal favorite combination, I must admit. Also, I'm coming off of a dramatic"
2545,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"It's been long time since I read standalone fantasy book. So far I mostly avoided Kay for no particular reason and I came into possession of this book almost by accident. What a happy accident it was as this turned out to be wonderful and pretty unique book.

I was pretty sure by the time I finished up the book that it was a solid 3*s but I then read the author's afterword and he states all of his influences and what he wanted to achieve with the book and I decided that this had to be a 4* book because I totally understood where he was coming from and it really resonated true with me.

I often wondered how it would be possible to create a whole new world in just one book and give it a satisfactory ending. When I read this book, I finally understood. Tigana is not a book. It is a journey. A journey through the lives of men and their emotions. A journey of wonder, a journey of pain and a journey of understanding. Rarely do you come across a book as"

2552,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,2,"I really liked the ideas behind this story—the power of names in the face of colonialism, in the face of enforced forgetfulness—but there was just too much in the writing that worked against my enjoyment of it. Kay's style has improved from what it was in the Fionavar series, but it's still clunky and laboured (and desperately in need of some commas), while the world-building is pedestrian and two-dimensional.

It is quite the epic, and it seems a waste of great worldbuilding to contain it to one volume. On the other hand, it is good to see such a marvelous work that stands on its own, without a dozen sequels, prequels, and hard to find novellas. In fantasy, that is a rare treat.

Kay was able to communicate the profound sense of loss felt by a dispossessed people and without the aid of music or even lyrics bring the music within the book alive to touch the imagination. I felt the mournful tones of the pipes, and the heart wrenching voice of Devin as he sings. Kay makes us imagine what it would be like if the memory of your home is removed not only from your"
2555,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,"Good book, terrific finish. This is my second book by the author and has me wondering if I should reread The Lions of Al-Rassan . Often in life somebody's best trait is also their worst when they take it to the extreme. Kay is this way with his verbose depictions of his worlds. Often their brilliant and then I want to eventually strangle him for not moving on. At some point you have to trust the reader gets it. The story in this was compelling and the world robust but what really made it was that"
2556,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"It says that I read this back in January 2000. It would be more accurate to say that I've read this book since January 2000. I've read this book no less than ten times. I own the 10th Anniversary Edition as well now, because I expect my first one to fall apart very soon. It's lost at least one cover being passed around among all my friends throughout high school. One day I will write a real review of this! Just can't put my thoughts together yet."
2557,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"I first heard about Guy Gavriel Kay shortly after joining Goodreads, and have just finally managed to get around to reading my first book. It won't be the last! Tigana was a wonderful reading experience. Complex, nuanced characters captured my heart and I hoped against hope that everyone could somehow be saved in the end. It was beautiful and tragic, full of loss, hope and redemption. I wanted to spend more time in the aftermath and follow them all home. It finished too soon."
2558,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"This is the first book by Kay I've ever read, and one of only three books on my shelves signed by the author (one of only two signed specifically to me, and the only one I actually got myself). Its size is daunting if you're not a regular fantasy reader, but it's a stand-alone novel and would be disappointing if it were any shorter. Tigana is about a great many things, but the central plot and theme of the novel is the subjugation of the people of the Peninsular of the Palm (modelled after Italy"
2559,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,"This story is, at its essence, about how the past influences the present. The protagonists are driven to reclaim their homeland not just from a conquering army, but from a magical spell that prevents others from remembering or even hearing their homeland's name, Tigana. Within a generation any knowledge of their land, its history and culture will be forever lost. Instead of a fast paced, sword and sorcery story, Tigana is rather reflective. There are several POV characters that spend a good deal"

I met Mr. Kay at a convention last August and I can now hear his voice in my head, reading the novel to me (he has a very nice voice). Tigana is a kingdom under a curse: the people were conquered and the name of their country can no longer be heard or remembered (except by those who lived through the conquest).

Tigana is among the handful of fantasy novels that can make me wonder whether Tolkien is as good as I remember him, or as good as his reputation. It has been many years since I read Lord of the Rings , and I almost never re-read books, so I might never find out. Perhaps Tolkien is like Shakespeare — it is easy to convince oneself that it is just hype, that he really can’t be all that astonishingly good; b"
2563,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,"Tigana offers a story about memory. How important is it to remember the past and how dangerous is it to overdo it? This also relates to the question of freedom. Is freedom really the ultimate goal. Is it worth every sacrifice, or is there are line where the price becomes too high. Guy Gavriel Kay asks this questions enveloped in a beautiful gown of lyrical prose and mythical tale. Most prominently featured are the young musician Devin and Dianora, a courtesan of the powerful wizard-king Brandin. Th"

His prose is beautiful without being flowery or ostentatious. It just flows and and leaves both wonderful images and reflections in its wake.

2566,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,A stand alone fantasy story - a very difficult task to achieve successfully. And Tigana accomplished that! The story is unique - there is sorcery and there is fighting and the prologue is to die for. The prose was fantastic - possibly the best part of the book. The characters also were really good - some excellent and some less interesting. Which makes the book more realistic (when was the last time you liked every single person you met and/or found them interesting)? The book will also try to sque
2567,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,I first time stumbled upon this book while searching for “best standalone fantasy novels”. It was ranked first in list made by bestfantasybooks.com for standalone novels. So I went ahead and gave it a shot. First chapter of the book went straight above my head and I was totally clueless what the story was about. But I continue reading (and thank the heaven for that) and after 3rd chapter the confusion was gone. After that I was totally unable to put it down. I don't think my review can do justic

Twenty years ago it faced invasion by the Ygrathian army led by its sorcerer king, Brandin of Ygrath. Prince Valentin led Tigana's armies in defense of their homeland. Despite the power of Brandin's sorcery, the embattled Tiganan army managed to win one battle but it was during this battle that King Brandin's son was killed. Filled with vengeance, Brandin went on to conquer Tigana but that was not enough for him"

The province of Tigana holds out for a long time, winning a big battle to keep their independence, and killing Brandin's favourite son in the process. Burning with rage Brandin takes charge of the war himself and ends it in a dramatic way: the province is under his control, the"
2571,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,"Executive Summary: An enjoyable stand-alone fantasy book that is a little uneven in places but really brings shades of gray to the characters and the story. Audio book: Simon Vance seems like the perfect reader for this book. I first encountered him as part of the great ensemble readers for Dune . I don't recall any particular voices of note, however. He does do Scottish accents for folks from ""The Highlands"". Overall I think he does an excellent job that is a good fit for the tone of the story. F"

The writing was fantastic and intricate, I immediately fell for the characters, and the world-building was detailed but presented well. (If you know how much I hate info-dumps, and how often it happens in fantasy, then you'll appreciate when a book does it well.)

It's just that this year I've tried to read books from a wider variety of genres, because that's what I wanted to do, and so I ended up not reading as much high fantasy as I would have liked to.

Nobody remembers Tigana — a land bright with beauty, culture, and wealth — nobody but those who lived there before the land was cursed by the conqueror Brandin of Ygrath after the prince of Tigana killed Brandin's son in battle.

2584,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,"Set in a faux Italian Renaissance, a land of City-States. I liked so much Kay's world-building and amid violence, a tender love story between former enemies. The land of Tigana has been put under a spell; no one can remember its name--in fact it has been renamed. The Peninsula of the Palm has been conquered by two tyrants, Brandin and Alberico, who have divided the land between them. Plot of Sandreni family against the tyrant Alberico fails miserably. Members of a troupe of travelling musicians"

It's been in my ""to be read"" mountain of books for ages and I haven't read anything by the author before. Tigana was a long and convoluted read. This was the story of a quest, of a land that had been forgotten by many due to the machinations of an evil sorcerer. It's a story of memory, lost and gained. A story of good triumphing over evil against insurmountable odds. Strangely enough it was the tyrant/s"
2589,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"God, I loved this book! I couldn't decide between four stars and five but I went with five since it made me cry. Three times. One of the things that most impressed me with this story was how smooth and polished the whole thing was. Although it gathered momentum as it went, it never really ebbed and flowed in the telling. It just went along, smooth and graceful from beginning to end. I listened to the audio book, which I couldn't recommend more. The narrator's voice was smooth and somewhat orator"
2590,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,The afterword on the audiobook was such a wonderful addition to this novel. The author tries to recall what caused him to write this story about a country losing its identity. The thoughtful examples added a great deal to the story.

They are, without exception, passionate people, and I love reading about passionate people, especially when they have a Cause. And boy, do the characters in this book have a cause. Can you say, epic cause? Tigana is the name of one of the countries of the Palm, a peninsula loosely based on Renaissance Italy. Divided and distrustful of one another, and unlikely"
2592,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,I’m going 4.5 on this high fantasy with that 5th star flickering but I don’t think it made it. If this book was 100 pages shorter and wasn’t as in depth in some of the lands it would have been a flat out 5 for me. The story of Tigana is a world where a very strong sorcerer had removed the memories of a country from everyone’s mind except from the people who lived there. Only the people that lived there can even understand when someone says the word Tigana. The sole remaining prince of Tigana sets

I have transcribed it verbatim from all those years ago (although square brackets may indicate some additional information for the sake of readability or some sort of commentary from now). This is one of my lost reviews. I loved being surprised like this. Every once in a while someone out of the ordinary suggests a book to me"
2594,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,I'll be honest I didn't think I was going to like this book much when I first started reading it. The descriptions of Devin and his singing group left me uninspired. I felt like I was looking at yet another fantasy world of magic and towers and bards and despots without much new. Then the hunting lodge. And it all turned. The themes of identity and country and suppression played on many things I've studied or thought about and I loved the depth in which Kay treated them within his otherwise famil
2595,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"Tigana is one of my favorite books in the world. Exquisitely written, magnificently peopled, set in a land and the ghost of a land I only wish I could get to. ""Powerful"" doesn't seem to quite describe it; there is a battle near the end which left me literally breathless the first time I read it. My heart was pounding, I couldn't catch my breath, I couldn't read fast enough... Nothing remotely like it has happened with any other book I've read. And I've read a lot of books.

2597,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"DH is the one I have to thank for first introducing me to Guy Gavriel Kay 's body of work. He was a fan of The Fionavar Tapestry and felt sure I would like them. And like them I did. So much so that I immediately went and read Kay's slightly later work--TIGANA. Originally published in 1990, TIGANA is an epic romantic fantasy and was nominated for both the World Fantasy Award and the Mythopoeic Fantasy Award. The story takes place in the Peninsula of the Palm--a world based on medieval Italy. Like"
2598,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"“Tigana, let my memory of you be like a blade in my soul.” This is the story of a beleaguered land struggling to be free. It is the tale of a people so cursed by the black sorcery of their invader, that even the name of their once-beautiful homeland cannot be spoken or remembered. After years of hopeless struggle, a handful of men and women plot to overthrow their conquerors and bring back to the world the brilliance of a long-lost name: Tigana. The palm had nine provinces, of which Tigana (now Lo"

It is described as lyrical, poetic, heartfelt, and beautiful. How could I not give it a try?

You have to really pay attention and remember little details to be able to understand later conversations, yet even then the dialogue is crypti"

But now, a couple hours later, I don't feel anything about it. I didn't take anything of value away from my reading, it has left no impression upon me. It is yet another story of the survivors of an occupation by a foreign tyrant biding their time before they can overthrow their ruler and reclaim their land. Nothing new in that part. How it differs is their land was not only overrun but"

And I tried to like it, I really did, but I'm not sure I ever had much of a chance since my biggest problem with the book was essentially the entire premise of the story.

Conquering tyrant comes to seek vengeance but doesn't stop at just slaughtering everyone and leveling the place. Nope he casts a spell to make everyone forget"
2602,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"Fantasy or more aptly coined as Escapist Fiction is one i relish. For the simple reason that they pull me out of the clutches of the pragmatic and bland everyday world and plunge me headlong into a colorful world. This was exactly what i had in mind when i picked Tigana up to read, the book proved me wrong. Fantasy here is but a mirror that reflects in many a way the Itlay of the renaissance, the India under the British Raj and so many other facets of world history. The simple but brutally hones"
2603,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,A another good historical fantasy novel from Kay. It was the type of book that had you really thinking about how much memory places in our actions. The book raised many thought provoking questions for me. Can you really rewind to the past to try to bring back a cultural that is now buried? Is belief enough to ultimately claim victory? Can you make a Tyrant more humane in the reader's eyes? Can you love someone who has done terrible things? At times the threads of the story could seem disconnected
2604,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,3,"3.5 stars. I do like the book, else I'd probably either skim over it or not finish it altogether, but not enough to ""really like it"". I understand the premise of this book which has an important message to tell; the Afterword by the author explains it quite well too. This is a well-written book in general and there are parts which really pull on my emotions and make me reflect on it afterwards for awhile. The love story here is one of the most fatally tragic ones I've read. But somehow I can't re"

2606,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,"At the more traditional and dull end of the fantasy genre we have writers writing redundant hero journeys full of elves and dwarves and other cutesy races. Then, at the other end, we have gritty realism with very few fantastic elements, and an inversion of the hero journey storyline. Either the heroes are croaking at a rapid rate (think Martin) or the heroes are...well...not heroes at all when you get down to it, and are incapable of growth (think Abercrombie).

From the look of the summary on the back of the book itself, I thought this was going to be a slow-moving and dry read. Boy, was I ever wrong. The characters...the characters! Devin had me gushing in an altogether fangirlish way every other page (well, for the sections that were in his POV). Catriana had me CHEERING. THIS is how you write female characters! Steven Moffat, take notes. I don't think I've ever seen characters like Alessan and"
2609,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"I found Tigana annoying me so much this time around. Kay's overly ornate way of writing, the way he makes even the simplest of events sound So Deeply Important by the formal way he's writing... But it all came together for me again when I sat down and just read. I fell in awkward, torn love with Alessan, with Brandin, with Catriana, with Dianora, with Baerd. I loved the way people came together, willingly and unwillingly, against the other halves of their hearts. I love how people became whole a"

At the beginning of this year resolved to tackle the genres I avoid, and obviously fantasy stood prominent. This is my 3rd fantasy book (the eye of the world and Game of thrones being the other 2).Was happy to know that it is a standalone.

2611,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,3,"I didn't love this book as much as everyone else seemed to. It's a fantasy novel set in an oppressed land. A region much like Italy is ruled by two sorcerers, and we follow a group of rebels who want to free the land from their tyranny. The rebels are from the Tigana region, but one of the sorcerers eliminated all memory of it from everyone who was born outside that region. A large part of their motivation was restoring the memory of their once great land to the rest of the country. I found it h"
2612,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"Okay I see why people call this GGK's best work, it's certainly wonderful and epic in scope. personally, I'm drawn more to his books that are more deeply rooted in a particular time period however (this is renaissance Italy but a loose version thereof). All the same it's wonderful as so worth reading. If you're intimidated by the length of the read, Simon Vance does the audio and he is so wonderful."

2614,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,"I loved this book. I loved it because it was wholesome and puerile. Which is a bad way to begin, because I'm sure that plenty of readers will take 'wholesome and puerile' as insults, and I don't meant them that way at all. This book seemed to me to have the spirit of a lively, chivalrous, teenage boy, which I found utterly charming. Set in a fantasy world loosely based on renaissance Italy, the story concerns the peninsula of the Palm which is currently being oppressed by two opposing tyrants. Ou"
2615,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,"I had trouble rating this as generously as others have. As a fantasy story, or a thick, complex allegory, or as the literary novel that Mr. Kay describes in the afterword to my edition, it was all just 'good'. There were a number of things that got in my way. 1- It's an epic story. And a character study. But it is told in such a way that it just builds up steam as an epic fantasy when it shifts gears into character study. Then back. And again. So for my calcifying brain, it was a constant case of"

I don't really remember specifics of the story but the overall strokes. It was sweeping and beautiful and hit quite close to home due to the injustice done to those in Tigana and how I paralleled it to general local Sabahan/North Borneo sentiment regarding the dark times in our history 1976/1994 (there is something here to write about but maybe not in this review).

I liked the complex plot, writing was beautiful and the end was absolutely mind blowing. Characters were good but I felt Dianora's character was portrayed the best. However , having said that I did find it dragging in the middle , the story line went slack and there were suddenly these whole new set of characters being introduced and bit too frequently. Dianora 's part was the best in"
2619,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"Another book from GGK that I really enjoyed. I'm not sure what is about his writing style or plotting but I was instantly hooked (much like when reading his Sarantine Mosaic books). I think a political intrigue plot, like the one in Tigana, could easily fall into a trap where everything goes too perfectly or that high risk events happen despite being planned years in advance but the pace and the twists in this book kept the pieces moving while never letting you see the whole board.

If I had to describe the male characters in one word, I would say ""self-entitled."" The female characters? ""Cardboard."" As hard as I tried to like this book, every page was a struggle and I'm not even sure I can fully articulate everything I despised about it. But I will try in this review. (Beware that there are some spoilers) The book fails to supply a base for all of its exaggerated emotional outbursts."

This could easily have been stretched out exhaustingly over several books, but thankfully it wasn’t. The author goes hard with the prose at times, but it feels appropriate for a story with such heavy emotional themes. Sometimes, there were almost too many names and too much history being thrown at me, which made it a struggle for my eternally distracted self, but after pushing through, I found a striking story about erasure, r"

Tigana was known for its towers and art, library and music until the day when its people killed Brandin's son, the wizard of Ygrath, sent by his father to conquer their country. From that day on, Tigana was forgotten. Tigana and her legacy were crushed under the boot of the grieving father, whose goal was to erase her memory from the pages of history. After years of op"
2626,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,"This is the fourth book I’ve read by Guy Gavriel Kay and he continues to blow me away. This guy can write, I truly truly mean that. Tigana was first published back in 1990 (I was only two!) and has been considered by many to be one of the best stand-alone fantasy novels ever written. While I thought that there were some overly dramatic elements and some minor plot issues it’s almost impossible to fault it due to the amazing prose found within. The story centers on the eight provinces that make u"
2627,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"Excellent. As a fellow Canadian I was, of course, not surprised at the quality of this book; we all pretty much write like this… I enjoyed Kay's Fionavar Tapestry, but Tigana is a tour de force, and in a single novel mind you, not a decology. In my view, Kay matured as a writer and it shows when you compare this to his earlier work. I can relate to another Goodreads review of Tigana in which the reviewer questions how good Tolkien really was after reading Tigana. He who comes first is often regard"
2628,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,"I really did enjoy reading this. Really, while it is based on fantasy, the main theme throughout the book is about love and loyalty. To individuals, to family, to country, to the living and the dead. I kept asking myself, who were the victims, where did my loyalties lie? There where a few people worthy of both, on both sides of the divide. It was one of those books that left you with a satisfied feeling at the end. The end surprised me, so I give nothing away by saying that. One thing I did like"
2629,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,"If you want more stories like the Lord of the Rings, with a scruffy, even-tempered lost prince fighting to regain his homeland from sorcerers, then Tigana is for you. In this case, one sorcerer has even eradicated the name of his homeland, and only with his death will it be remembered. However, said sorcerer is not portrayed as evil, and to me, this is where the story grew interesting. He was simply angry over the death of his son in battle, and in grief he enacted his revenge against Tigana. The"
2630,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,"It was good...really good, but the authors ponderous, occasionally convoluted style prevents him getting a five. Ten percent shorter, this would have been an even better book. Rich, involved plot with complex characters--more than needed perhaps. Evokes more Robert Jordan than J.R.R. Tolkien even though he assembled a band of odd personages reminiscent of the Fellowship of the Ring. Midway, Kay seemed to lose lost track of his own plot for the fun of developing ancillary characters. All the backgr"
2631,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,2,"I got halfway into this and then just... didn't want to read it any more. I'm not sure what went wrong. Well, I mean, I guess part of what went wrong was that the characters seemed to be sort of blundering into things. I had just finished the scene where the dude gets seduced by whatsername, and then there's this whole scene where Baerd goes for a walk and runs into a secret cult of magic-warriors who have been coincidentally waiting for years for him to come along and lead them to glory, so he d"
2632,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,3,"I heard a lot of good things about Guy Gavriel Kay so when I picked this up I was anxious to read it. At first I hated the book. The characters seemed all over the place with their moods going from exuberance to depression to anger in seconds. They also seemed to do the same in love, one minute loving one person, then another. At first I was sure Devin and Catriana were going to get over their hate for each other, and they almost did until Devin met another girl and suddenly Catriana was in love"
2633,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,"I really enjoyed this book. Tigana is set in a medieval or renaissance world, in a planet orbited by two moons and with some of the most unforgettable characters. The characters are all so meticulously developed. They aren't all good or bad, they are all just so human. This is not a typical fantasy book. It does have some magic, but it is the people and their conflicts that drive the story. Dianora is my favourite character in this book. Her inner conflicts and her story arc really made the book"
2634,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"There has long been a backlash on the internet for people's tendency to overuse the term "" epic ."" Well, despite that, the only adjective appropriate to describe Tigana is epic. It is epic fantasy of the highest order. The writing is poetic, the characters are deep, the plot is complex, and the stakes are high -- without being mired in most of the ""evil plan"" tropes that most heroic fantasy suffers from. It is one of the greatest fantasy stories ever told, and I couldn't recommend it more highly."
2635,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,This book was absolutely amazing. It's a nice change of pace to read a self-contained fantasy novel. This story revolves around a fictional land divided between two conquering sorcerer rulers and one group of people trying to bring their home land's name back into the world. The characters are gripping and the writing is so rich and detailed. I loved every minute of it and it makes me sad that I'll never experience reading Tigana for the first time again. A+
2636,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"This was the first novel I read by Guy Gavriel Kay. It's also the most emotional novel I've ever read. Kay's characters are so well drawn they seem real and you really care about them. It's a wonderful, powerful, heartbreaking story. The last 50 pages are incredible. Even if fantasy isn't your bag, it is masterful storytelling and you would do yourself a great disservice by not reading it."
2637,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"Read this book when it first come out in the early 90s. It's a complexed, deep read. Well worth the effort of reading this book. I have been recommended to loads of friends and family over the years and will continue to do so."
2638,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,1,"This contains a lot of spoilers. I don't recommend that you read it unless you've read the book or have no intention of doing so. I honestly don't write reviews that much either, but I was so irritated by the end of this novel that I had to write about it because all the other reviews on this page sing such praise, which seems to be the case of most Goodreads reviews for book. So here's how I feel, be prepared for some harsh criticism. Oh Tigana... you were not at all what I had imagined. This was"
2639,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,2,*SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS* *SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS* *SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS* *SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS* *SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS* Is it possible for a book to be simultaneously too long and too short? Tigana really stands out as an example of why so many fantasy authors spread out their story over several books. One book isn't enough in the epic fantasy game. I used to think that those prolific authors were just getting caught up in their fantasy world without really furthering the cha

2642,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,"What's in a name? - William Shakespeare. But name is what gives us identity, but what would happen somebody took that name always from us.A name is what links us to the history and our civilization.It is this theme which Guy has explored in Tigana .At the end of the book he gives us sources on which Tigana was based. The story although moves forward through multiple pov's but the main pov's in this book are 1.Devin 2.Baerd 3.Dianora 4.Brandin Devin is basically an singer who is moving with his troupe fr"
2644,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,"Fabulous. Complex characters, beautiful scenery, unique storyline and great prose."
2645,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,3,"I had to think for a while before I could rate or review this book. Perhaps the trouble is that I listened to it. Simon Vance is the narrator and I usually like his stuff, but maybe he wasn't the right one for this book. I had a hard time relating to or liking the characters until the end. The recording has a snip by Guy Gavriel Kay talking about the book at the end and that explained a lot, as he talked about the ambiguity of the characters as an important element in the book. That I can live w"
2648,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"I loved this book! One scene in particular stays with me - a woman diving after a ring. It was great! Oh, and the scene where magic is first revealed in the beginning. Oh, and...well, you get the idea. There's a lot of great things in this wonderful stand-alone fantasy novel, and I kick myself for letting it sit on the shelf for a year before reading it. Don't you do that, silly-pants! Read this sucker today!"
2649,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"Set in a medieval Italy type of society. How does a fantasy tale with a setting strongly suggesting a historical setting, without referencing any actual historical events or people, strike your fancy? If it does, this is a great read. An award winning novel. I've read a couple of Kay's stories, and I should read more. Thoroughly enjoyable. Good characterization."
2650,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,2,"This is not a review of this book's quality, or the author's skill, this is just my reaction to it. Which is to say: Gah! Everybody is so! Sad! All the time! But, ""No"", you say, ""not Devin"". But he wants to be. He wants to be like the cool kids. The sad! cool kids. And enough with the Death Wheels, already."
2651,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,Love his prose style. Enough action to keep the story moving but not so much that it overwhelms the characters. Loved it!
2652,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,"Website Review: http://commontouchoffantasy.com/book-... Youtube Review: http://youtu.be/HFgnWNYyM8I Tigana by Guy Gavriel Kay is triumph of a stand alone fantasy novel because it creates a world more rich and real than most fantasy series that require 3+ books. 4/5 “We all do that. We do with our hands, our eyes, what we are afraid to say.” – Tigana, pg 628 Pros: – Deeply flushed out world that feels real – Characters that are believable and act reasonable – Interesting premise of a whole nation that h"
2653,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"This audiobook - beautifully read by Simon Vance, bless his name forever - took a long time to listen to, simply because circumstances dictated I could only listen to it at work: not an environment conducive to the powerful emotions the book gives rise to. I had to seize my moments, especially for the last chapters. Someday, I hope, I'll write a new full review; in the meantime I'll just say a few things: The characters are truly amazing. No one is perfect. No one is perfectly evil or possible to"
2654,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,"I loved this book! I am so sad its over. This book was just some random I found on GR but its description caught me as well as the reviews, who I must say, reviewed this book so accurately and now that I am done, I can agree with basically all of them (at least those that gave it 4 to 5 stars.) The world building in this book is just brilliant. While reading, I felt as if I walked through every street, every tavern. As for the actual story, I found it so gripping as I did with the characters who"
2657,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"The more I read of Kay the more my admiration for him grows. Tigana was the fourth book that i read of him. Its a wonderful and original tale of a group of ppl who want to have their occupied land free again. They act as a travelling troupe of artists who try for years to incite the revolting fire to their fellow citizens. It is a tale of intrigue, mystery, conspiracies, longing, oppresion, love, hatred and revenge. The worldbuilding is incredible. The peninsula of Palm is described so lively and"
2659,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"I loved loved loved this book! So much so I had to look up one and two star reviews of Tigana to see what people could possibly have against it. :)Do other people do that or is it simply a wierd habit of mine? The main reason some disliked it was, it appears,lack of action at the beginning making it difficult to get into. Well true,it isn't a book for an action junkie; its much deeper than that.Kay does give the background story to each person and to each new event, slowly bringing together the"
2660,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,3,"To be honest, this is a book my sister read about 55 % of, so these are mostly her opinions: May contain spoilers. I don't have much good things to say about this book. It was a drag to read, even on something as fluid as an E-reader, the characters while fleshed out, never did anything and they interactions between all of them, both on Brandin's side and Devan's side seemed really forced, especially the ""relationship"" between Devan and Catrina. I never understood that part and its necessity. The"
2661,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"August 2009. This is still such a beautiful, beautiful book. This is my first reread, but I can tell you already that it won't be my last. The writing is gorgeous, and the imagery and the politics and the characters are all amazing. The careful laying of the plot, with the different subplots that weave in, like the Carlozzini and Dianora's own plans, is amazing. There are so many points in the book where I found tears coming to my eyes that I don't even know how many times it happened. It's an am"
2662,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"I was supposed to read this book last year as part of my failed Booktuber Recommends Project, wherein I requested twelve booktubers recommend me a novel. I would then read one a month over the course of a year. If you're reading this Michael, I'm sorry! I'm slowly making my way through that list now. I have read Guy Gavriel Kay's Fionavar Tapestry series and was anxious to see how this would compare. Since this is my fourth of Kay's works, I have to say that I wouldn't recommend him as a place"
2663,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,2,"I have to say that I quit reading this book somewhere between 150 and 200 pages in. How can a book go so wrong? It started with a little action and some nice world-building, a little younger-feeling in its style than I prefer, but not bad. And then the plot began and BOOM! crappy writing. The adage is SHOW, don't TELL. If you have to clearly dictate to the reader exactly what the character is feeling, even after they take actions that should illustrate in a more dynamic way, either you, as the aut"
2664,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"Why oh why have I put off reading Guy Gavriel Kay for so long!? I am kicking myself. But at least now I have found my way. Story: Tigana is a true delicacy. The prose is beautiful, elegant and enchanting. I've not read a standalone novel with such depth of worldbuilding and meaning. There is action, fighting, music, subterfuge, magic, twists, suffering, pain, and love. This book moved me in a way that really took me by surprise. Something about the oppressed fighting for freedom always gets me go"
2665,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,1,"It was written well enough - the commas were in the right places, the paragraphs looked right from a distance and the weight of the volume was adequate to let you know you were holding a real live book. I almost never review a book I couldn't finish, but here I am, going at for the sake of other Fantasy readers. There's nothing here that couldn't have been produced by a fantasy book-writing machine. It's the same general land, the same kind of magic, the same level of technology, the same the sa"
2666,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,"I’ll keep this short and sweet. Tigana was a beautiful, sad and exhilarating story. The writing was very descriptive with a good sense of place and the character development was amazing. I loved following the story from different viewpoints and having the chance to understand all sides in the painful war that occurred prior and rebellion which eventually followed. I would have given Tigana top marks if it wasn’t for the over describing of lands and politics which slowed things down for me more t"
2667,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,2,"Pros: - Well written - Great main female character - The final scene of the epilogue is perfect - No sequels Cons: - Overly sentimental - Shockingly homophobic - Simplistic worldbuilding - Drawn out (600 pages of build-up, 20 pages of resolution) Final verdict: Tigana achieves epic scope within a single book (take notice, fantasy authors and readers alike!), yet it's mostly boring and predictable story that offers little to nothing new, and in some places feels insulting and badly dated. Still, GGK is obvi"
2668,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"How would you be affected if you lost the entire history of your country, people and family? Everything taken and erased (obliterated) from the memories of the everyone else. Your complete identity only known to you and few like you. Your entire legacy gone. Kay writes very well - especially given the sadness of the subject, and he takes the time to really explain a lot of the situations. That makes the story telling slow at times, but the overall enjoyment higher. This is sad and excellent at the"
2669,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"Reading this book makes me realize how much so-so fantasy I've been reading lately, wanting it to be top-notch. Tigana is the real deal. The story is paced beautifully, the quest seems desperately important as you read, and the ending is deeply satisfying. The writing is beautiful and full of wonders. Kay is on a par with C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien. Tigana is one of the half-dozen best fantasy tales ever written."
2670,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,2,"In Tigana, every gathering is a circlejerk. Q: Is a more thoughtful review in order where criticisms are nuanced and well-defined and give examples? A1: No. A2: Filter for two stars. I agree with those reviewers. Q: All of them? A: All of them. Q: Even those with contradictory opinions? A: Yes."
2671,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,2,"DNF at 7%, 52 pages. I found myself doing anything but reading this book. There was nothing wrong with it, but I never felt invested in the world or characters. But most important was the fact I could not make myself pick it up. Perhaps this is the case of wrong book at the wrong time."
2672,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,"Tigana is a well balanced, compelling, multifaceted book which plays with many deeper themes. Kay's characterization is incredible. Well worth reading. Read my full review here: http://bookwormblues.blogspot.com/201..."
2673,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"I must have read this book like a million times! It is a model of how to create deep and real characters. An extraordinary puzzle of places, situations and people, with an ending that is truly felt like a blade in the soul."
2674,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,Excellent read for me. Great piece of standalone fantasy.
2675,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"Right after finishing this book, the only words I could come up with to describe it were: ""Wow! Holy f*cking wow!"" Indeed, those words were my constant refrain throughout the whole story. I'll try to be more coherent here, but I know that no review could really do justice to how brilliant this novel is. A new favorite On the front cover of the 10th anniversary edition of this book, there is a review by another author that says, ""One of the best fantasy novels I have read"" . I won't hesitate to echo"
2676,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,2,"While it’s not a bad book, this novel is (for me) a study of what prevents a fantasy novel from attaining the heights of mastery. It looks like Kay had learned during this process while working on this book, and delivered The Lions of al-Rassan six years later, which I loved. That result was a focused, compelling work without extraneous and distracting events or characters. As for this, I skimmed the last 2/3. Nevertheless, writing a review helps me think through what worked and what didn’t in n"
2677,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"Though it goes against all modern 'how to write a novel' guides (show don't tell? don't use too many characters? not too many descriptions?) this is probably one of the best fantasy books I ever read. With infinite patience, Guy Gavriel Kay weaves the story of a land that is not only defeated in war, but whose existence has been wiped from memory by the sorcery of its conqueror. Alessan, the last prince of Tigana and a number of his friends set out to regain their freedom, but what makes this st"
2678,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,3,"My ideal kind of fantasy is just historical fantasy set on earth, but low magic secondary world settings strongly based on history are almost as good. And two of the most highly regarded authors and fantasy happen to write just that sort of world. But unfortunately for me, from my one book experience with each, Guy Gavriel Kay suffers from some of the same problems as KJ Parker. Tigana is another Thrones-like, a historicist fantasy about political intrigue and strategy in deciding the fate of an"
2679,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"Wow! What a trip that was! I will seek other books by this author. As it was, my current edition of ""Tigana"" was a tenth anniversary edition with an interesting Afterword by the author. The original publication was in 1990. What a great resource Goodreads is to discover books one would never otherwise not know about. Fantasy with historical overtones is ""Tigana."""
2681,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"After reading the 7th book written by Kay this year, I decided to rewrite my reviews. They could, of course, never do justice to his books. But at least I try harder. Tigana is one powerful story that I am sure will appeal to more than fantasy fans. It is a story that is set in another realm with magic and powers and different orders, but it is all still about human. Sometimes, by borrowing those strange elements from the other world, it brings us closer to understand ourselves, to realize how v"
2682,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,"I don't read a lot of high fantasy novels because I'm more of a contemporary romance kind of person. And because of that, it takes me a while to really get into a world, especially one that required maps and had different names of people with powers and such. I noticed that a lot of high fantasy novels often had a lot of characters, too -- with odd names to boot -- so sometimes I feel like I need to get into a different kind of mindset before I take on a high fantasy novel. Hah, I feel like I sou"
2683,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"Fantastic book, one of the best fantasy novels I've ever read. I love that it's also just one book and not a series too. Page-turner, beautifully written."
2685,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,1,"It's not that Tigana defied my expectations or misled me -- I clearly understood what the author wanted me to believe -- it just failed to convince me to buy anything it was selling. Namely, I wound up disliking the protagonists and cheering for the tyrant. This is purposefully done by the author, but he wildly overshot his mark. He lost me the moment one of our heroes enslaves another character in the name of his cause. It left an extremely nasty taste in my mouth and I never got past it. He the"

2687,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,3,"Audiobook version ;) This was an unfortunate choice for an audiobook. The characters were intricate, and there were several I really cared about. The settings were well done. . But on audio it did not work for me for a couple of reasons: it was difficult to follow with family interruptions, and the names were so odd that I had trouble keeping people clear. Other reviewers mentioned the complexity of characters (the reason I bought this) but I was underwhelmed. It is true the 'good' weren't flawle"
2688,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,2,"This book actually compels me to write my first review on Goodreads. It was just so annoying to read that I can't leave it uncommented: First, the prose. The wording often is over the top, pompous, using the cheapest analogies. Throughout, the author is trying desperately to convey dense moods but utterly fails by overburdening the reader with heaps of schmaltzy adjectives. Here is the first sentence of chapter 1: ""In the autumn season of the wine, word went forth from among the cypresses and oliv"
2689,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,2,"Man, it took forever to finish this one. A standalone fantasy novel can be really good under the right conditions. This one is considered legendary by many, but to me it just got bogged down in uninteresting filler material. Tigana is the tale of a land locked within a brutal, feudalistic society. It is the tale of a people whose home has been erased, as two evil, totalitarian despots vie against one another in a power struggle. These two tyrants are essentially kings ruling with virtually absolut"
2690,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"Tigana is a novel of many ideas, it's a novel about identitiy, about culture, and about having one's culture and identity taken away, stolen from them before they even knew it existed. What would you do? Well, if you're anything like the chracters in this novel, you will fight back, you will do your best to remind the world of your country, your culture, and your name. Where to even begin here? Well, Tigana is a piece of fantasy written by Guy Gavriel Kay, inspiried by midieval Italy, we are intr"
2691,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,3,"I might warm up on the second reading to this one. I did with the other novel by Kay that I have read--Song for Arbonne. Or not. Maybe my opinion won't change, maybe it will. For now, I remember is as a good story that failed to draw me in. Perhaps I just couldn't resonate with the characters. One question: What is with the incest and fantasy books? Does every sister have to sleep with her brother? this reminds me of the Songs of Ice and Fire (watched it, not read it, I might read it- off course"
2692,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,3,"Tigana is a good fantasy novel that's hindered by occasional POV fatigue—shifting erratically, even frantically at times. Much of Tigana is worthwhile, and most of it is enjoyable. I'd comfortably recommend this book to any fan of epic fantasy, especially as it's its own complete entity (no ten-part series here, just a solitary work). However, I did feel that some sections of the story were throw-away. For example, a lengthy section around the middle of the book sees one of our (many) primary cha"
2693,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,3,"I like Tigana . I would have love this book, if only Dianora is braver, or her brother had a happy ending, or Catriana did not end up with the most unlikely partner. So many ifs, that even if the fantasy was grand, I could not give it a 4, knowing that these chinks in Tigana 's armor do not bother me at all. Because they do. A lot. The pace was slow, at the start, until I'm halfway done. See the patience I have of seeing Tigana through? And yet when the war began, it coalesced, then consumed my thin"
2694,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"I don't even know what to say about this book. It was so incredibly written, I can't even begin to describe all the things I loved about it. I remember reading something about three elements of a great book; plot, characters, and prose. If a book has at least 2 of the 3, it's a good book. If it has all three, it's a great book. This one definitely focuses on characters and prose, but has a good plot as well. There are a lot of fantastic themes at play here - memory, complicated and ambiguous eth"
2696,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"Wow—Tigana is the most underrated fantasy novel ever. The power of emotions is what really carries this story. The characters are painstakingly formed with every characteristic traceable to a specific moment in time, and the emotional rawness of each character enables the reader to get really close to the characters and truly understand their thoughts and motivations. They are also all wonderfully complex and flawed. For the first time, I found myself rooting for the villain to win; ten pages la"
2697,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"I read this book years ago and loved it. I'd always meant to read more GGK but, shockingly, never got around to it until very recently. After tackling A Song for Arbonne (good) and The Lions of Al-Rassan (amazing), I decided to re-read Tigana and see if it held up to my memories. To keep it brief, yes, the book did hold up, and then some. GGK is such a beautiful writer, but I think it's the characters in Tigana that put it head and shoulders above most fantasy. You can't call these personalities"
2698,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"What do you begin to say about the experience of reading a book that so deeply resonated with and changed you? Tigana is an absolute masterpiece, and I have never read something that so filled me up with its beauty and colored my perceptions of life. Guy Gavriel Kay is a master of language - his prose is purely lyrical, but the loveliness of this work goes far deeper than that. There is a magic to this story, to the portrayal of characters, to the world he creates, that I have never before encou"
2699,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,2,"I listened to this book as part of a book club. There were many people that almost gave up or gave up on this book. The book starts very slowly so just be aware that it takes a few hours to get going. And even after that there are many flat bits. The author was the man that helped Tolkien's son put together Silmarillion so you get the idea on his style. Many compare him to GRR Martin, which is pretty accurate. But at least Martin is enriching a world for a huge series. The author spends a lot of"
2700,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,3,"After reading Guy Gavriel Kay's excellent Under Heaven , this book felt like a bit of a step backwards in my admiration for the author. While Under Heaven seemed to effortlessly walk the tightrope between action and love and philosophizing about the paths that men and women take in their search for meaning in their lives, this story seemed more forced, and definitely more violent. I almost put it down several times, but was sucked in enough to have to read to the ending. And I have to mention a s"
2701,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,3,"G.G. Kay's is a bit of a piecemeal fantasy, and I consider it a piecemeal success. At the beginning too wordy and expository, and later on rushed and fragmentary, this is pretty clearly the stand-alone work of a novelist who likely should have been working in a series (and heaven knows there are plenty of the opposite in this world). The intelligence of this novel is in the way its politics sneak up on you: what seems at first a straightforward bit of Robin-Hood-esque derring do and revolution i"
2702,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,"This was my first GGK novel, and overall I thought it was quite good. It's basically the story of a nation divided by war, ruled over by two sorcerers. One of the sorcerers (who, despite being the ""bad guy"" was one of my favorite characters) cast a spell many years ago that basically wipes out the memory of a particular province, Tigana, for all but those who lived there. And, predictably, a small band of survivors is now plotting and fighting to restore the memory of Tigana and reclaim the plac"
2703,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"The only thing that last after we are gone, is our name. Memory of us in the world. And it was robbed from the people of Tigana. Their existence and past was only known to people born in Tigana. For everyone else, Tigana never existed. And the ones who survived the terrible fate are left to reclaim what was theirs. Their name and the freedom to say it aloud to others. But the book is not about that. It’s about the people who had to face the truth, make difficult choices, and live with the conseq"
2704,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,"I liked this book every bit as well as I remembered. It's as layered as an onion, complex, full of satisfying and memorable characters deployed in a world that's rich and believable. The magic is well-thought out. There are plot twists in plenty- as there should be when there's a dispossessed Prince in a band of itinerant musicians. There are brave and noble women with complicated lives. Beyond the well-told story, though, what this book seems to me to be is an exploration of loyalty and honor an"
2705,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"This book is the rarest of gems - it's lauded as a classic, and for once the reviews are spot on. A sorcerer-king declared war upon Tigana, and his son was slain in battle. Enraged and grieving for his son, the king erased Tigana from the world. No one who wasn't born in Tigana knew that the land ever existed; they couldn't even understand the name if spoken aloud. Those native to Tigana - renamed Lower Corte - became homeless in the truest sense of the word. Nineteen years later an odd assorment"
2706,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,"Not much I can add to the wonderful reviews already written about Tigana. Excellent world building and characters; a story of love and loss, tragedy and hope, and a whole lot of blurred lines which is what made the characters so realistic. Kay has a way of writing compelling characters and complex plotting yet being easy to read, comfortable. There's a natural artistry to his work. I'm always complaining how there's not many standalone novels in SF/F, well I got my wish, an absorbing tale all on"
2707,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,3,"Great characters. Good, interesting storyline. The power play and the political intrigue are well done. The twists were not too predictable. Just one at the end was so out of the blue, that I found it annoying and out of place. Intelligent fantasy for grown-ups, with the heroes and the bad guys not just in black and white, but with a lot of grey shades in between. Some parts of the book had a lot of suspense and I could not put the book down. Unfortunately other parts bored me a lot and were rea"
2708,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,3,"This book didn't affect me as profoundly as it has many of those who read it. I liked it well enough but I didn't fall into it or feel myself ripped to bits, which to be frank, is what I was expecting from a writer like Kay. But that's just me...there's no doubt that Kay's writing is intensely emotive and he can set a grand scene. In Tigana he paints the human condition, broadly comprising life, love and memory, in broad sweeping strokes as well as with delicate tints using ivory brushes...this"

So I decided to tattoo it to my left arm and just show it to Mr. Greg or The Paper when I get there and get over with it… but when I got there I had to deliver some scones to a Briton… and since she (the Briton) used to work"
2710,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"I have no words that would do Kay justice. The man is a master of words, mood manipulator, a character building genius. I have probably cried more tears for his books than all the other books I ever read combined. If there is ever a safe way to erase a part of your memory I might go to get my Kay memories erased so I can enjoy him again for the first time. Read his books, thank me later. Croatian translations are superb, btw. Normally I'd always recommend reading in original language if that's an o"
2711,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,1,"I made it 75% of the way through before finally giving up. I just couldn't bring myself to care about any of it. I wouldn't say it's a bad book altogether, there were parts that were interesting to me but I found myself dreading coming back to it each time, and after picking up another book and remembering what it's like to be excited to read something, I decided to give this one up entirely. Not a great first impression of Kay but I will definitely try at least one other book of his eventually."

It helps me keep a written log of my thoughts on certain elements of published novels, so that I can track what I see, what I like, what I want to avoid in my own writing. I've been reading fantasy books for twenty years or more, and like everyone, there are things I like to read and things I don't. However, now that I'm also writing my own novels, I see the need for certain elements, for what they do to a plot. So come along w"
2717,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"So good. Standalone fantasy is hard to do right, but GGK found a way here. Beautiful prose and worldbuilding, a wide cast of characters with nuanced development and diverse backgrounds and motives. I love the slow inevitable buildup of the plot towards the culmination of everything the characters were working towards- like Robin Hobb, GGK takes his time building up character relationships and story tension before unleashing major events, and that creates a suspension and inevitability that I so"

This is even less of a review than usual and more of stream-of-consciousness. When I first discovered GGK four or five years ago--I read The Lions of al-Rassan , and absolutely loved it, and it launched GGK onto my list of favorite authors, where he has remained ever since. I then gave Tigana a shot--I think I tried to read it in a couple"

Only paths we had not known we were meant to walk.” This book has been on my radar for a while, but I came across it recently and noticed a friend had read it so I decided to take the plunge and I am glad that I did.

They intimidated me as they began to emerge; even recording them now I find myself shaking my head. But beneath them all lies the idea of using the fantasy genre in just this way: letting the universality of fantasy—of once upon a time—allow escapist fiction to be more than just that, to also bring us home.

Some books... simply just can not be reviewed, some books must be experienced; you simply just have to beg people to read them... that's how much I have fallen in love with Guy Gavriel Kay. I wanted to start this review off with text along the lines of “this may be the best book I’ve read this year,” except it just wouldn’t sound quite as impressive since Tigana is the first book I finished in 2013.

Not so for the Tigana, where I felt like I was respectfully enduring the book till it could end and I could walk away. Tigana seemed like a formula fantasy novel. Others say this book is brilliant and so I think I am missing a great deal. Perhaps, I am at fault for processing a novel written in the 90’s about a medieval type time period through my current lens. My first problem is t"

Kay's writing, including the dialogue, feels very formal, so I felt like I never heard the voice of any of the characters. Devin, who is ostensibly the main character, felt more like a blank slate than a real person. He's the rookie through whom the reader is introduced to the world, but he himself never feels like a fleshed-out character. Kay's poe"

Perhaps not even directly, because there is so much more in this book this time than I remember getting out of it at the time.

2730,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,"Tigana is an epic fantasy story told within a single book. It’s full of political maneuvering and schemes, blind devotion to causes, touching friendships, and a bit of magic. There was enough world-building in this one book to sustain a longer series, and I would have happily read more books featuring this world and these characters. The characters were where Tigana really shone for me. Several of them were very likeable, and I thought the friendships between them were especially well-written. T"
2731,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,"I first read this book about a year ago, but wasn't sure I could do it justice in a review. Simply put, this is an amazing book. Tigana is the name of a lost country, conquered in the prologue by a sorcerer determined to wipe out its culture and even its name and identity. The story mostly follows a group of freedom fighters, including the exiled prince, who are determined to win their land back; also crucial is a Tiganese woman who infiltrates the sorcerer's harem planning to kill him, but wind"
2733,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,3,"SETTING: Kay puts a lot of thought and detail into the world-building, and I feel he was successful in creating a sense of place and it making the setting transportive. There wasn't anything particularly creative about what he did with the world, though. The magic system wasn't defined at all, and everything was taken from your average medieval-esque society. PLOT: The premise itself is interesting but so little happens over the course of the book--small preparations for the big event here and th"
2734,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,"In a lot of ways, the arc of this novel is the most traditional of any fantasy I've read: a rag-tag group of adventurers go an adventure to take back their homeland from a tyrant; alternating with a counterpoint narrative of unwilling member of the tyrant's harem, and her complex feelings for him. Coming from the early 90s, the novel shows a lot of indication of the things that have fascinated readers of the genre since: it shows the heroes doing very bad things, and ultimately does a lot to com"
2735,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,"3 stars Tigiana is a pretty lovely book, especially in its ideas. It’s a story about language, and memory, and how people deal with the past, and about how people do kind of awful things for pretty understandable reasons. It’s also, in typical Guy Gavriel Kay fashion, about a world that’s changing from what it had been before, and how people learn to live with that. There are a lot of things about this story that are wonderful, but I think what really makes it work is the storyline surrounding Dia"

The premise for the book is really a pretty cool curse. While King Brandin"

2738,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,"I believe the best way to describe what was for me the essence of Tigana is to quote a passage from the afterward of the book by the author Guy Gavriel Kay: “... there's a play called 'Translations', by Brian Friel. It is basically an extended, passionate debate between a village priest in Ireland and the leader of an English survey team that has been traversing the countryside, mapping it carefully and - more importantly - changing the names of places, from Gaelic to English.

It was a favorite of mine at the time, and I have always recalled it fondly. However, after completing a re-read, it has become painfully obvious that the enjoyment I received from this book must have been one of those teenage fads because . . . it has disappeared right along with my desire to keep solving a Rubik’s Cube.

2741,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"Immediate Reaction: This was a blast. A little fantasy-noir fun for anyone who likes bad men behaving with honour. Vlad Taltos is an anti-hero extraordinaire, and all the minor characters and relationships he's surrounded with are equally cool. Later: This is only the second book I've read by Steven Brust , and the first I've read that he wrote alone.

2742,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"The recent release of Iorich sent me down the path of re-reading the Taltos series. While Iorich was enjoyable and engrossing, memories sent me back to the inaugural Vlad. Sophisticated writing, interesting characters and one seriously convoluted plot. It's interesting, because this is the fourth book in the timeline of the series and Vlad's history, but actually the first published (echoes of Lucas). I'd recommend reading Jhereg first, as it's told in a largely linear fashion with only a few fl"

It flew by so quickly and easily, I was rather surprised at how much info-dump never came across as info-dump. I learned so much about the world, naturally, that I"
2745,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,"5.0 stars. The Vlad Taltos series is one thst I strongly recommend to anyone who likes good fantasy. I would classify it as ""noir"" fantasy with a good sense of humor. Great world-building, great characters and well-written, tight plots that do not drag and are never boring. As good as all that is, it is the main character of Vlad Taltos (assassin, witch and rogue) and his ""jhereg"" familiar that make the series so special. Highly recommended."

Now that I've read most of the rest of the series, I see on a re-read that the craftsmanship of this story demands another star.

This was my first time reading a Steven Brust novel even though he has been in my queue for as long as I can remember. This is a novel that was first published nearly 30 years ago. It is written in a fashion that keeps it fresh and relative to todays fantasy scene. The combination of magic(sorcery)and witchcraft is very unique. The book gives some creative back story that explains the difference between the two s
2750,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"This was a delightful beginning to a series that I am sure to be addicted to very soon. In fact, I've already jumped into the second volume. But on this. Jhereg is a first person narrative of an assassin and a particular job he undertook. A huge amount of money offered showed that if something seemed too good to be true, it probably was. Mischief and mayhem ensue. What I thought of as a combination of a crime caper and an epic fantasy turned out to be a quickly paced and often humorous adventure."

Reading Jhereg, I have come to learn that things to happen in those books. Interesting things, things that move the story forward. Jhereg is a book where nothing happens, and is incredibly dull about the whole thing.

I was first made aware of this series when I read What Makes This Book So Great by Jo Walton . I didn't actually read the chapters on this series but her introduction to them was enough to pique my interest. Brust almost introduces too much into the world in this first book. There's a long history that is teased in this novel but seems to have far reaching effects. There are 17 Great Houses of the empi
2763,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,Picked this one up on a whim - turned out totally into it from start to finish. Witch that is a mafia don? Check Adorable and snarky little dragon familiar? Check Very intricate world building that you don't even notice because it's done so well? Check Old school fantasy fluff? Check Would have been totally satisfied if this one a standalone. Very happy that it isn't. :)
2764,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"Ages ago, I read Jo Walton’s reviews of the Vlad Taltos books and resolved to read them immediately. I did pick up this first book, but after that failed to carry on, even though the first book is good and Jo’s reviews fascinating. There’s a lot going on in this world, and I really want to read more of the books to get a better grasp on it. In the meantime, Vlad Taltos himself is snarky, moderately capable, and definitely capable of getting himself into trouble. A winning combination – even with"
2765,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"Brust does such a good job making these slim novels engaging and multifaceted. Fun capers, interesting character development and relationships, foreshadowing, meditations on free will and morality. Jhereg, while not the best in the series, is a very good book; there's a reason why this is the fourth or fifth time I've read it."
2766,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"Jhereg is a fantasy with a sort of reverse murder-mystery twist; where the protagonist's dilemma is not 'Whodunnit?' but 'How do I do it?'. Vlad Taltos is a skilled assassin, but his latest target is a little tricky to tackle and a little hard to find. But luckily Vlad has a small cadre of friends of varied talents to call upon, including his assassin wife, and his psychically bonded pet jhereg (a sort of miniature dragon). Vlad is also living proof that not all assassin characters have to be dar"
2767,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,"This was a fun read, a mystery/caper fantasy story about an assassin who accepts a challenging job that turns out to be even more dangerous and consequential than he expects. I enjoyed the lighthearted tone of the narrative, and I liked Vlad's first-person account. He's a little incongruous as an assassin who goes weak at the knees at the thought of being targeted himself, even though death is not often permanent in this universe. I liked the magical system pretty well, and there is a lot of magic"
2768,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"This book took me a while to get around to, but was well worth the ride. It covers a rather grim society of Dragerans (more like particularly evil, seven-foot elves) and humans-beneath-notice, neither of which seem to view death as much more than an inconvenience. One of the key elements of the story is that death is not permanent - provided you can pay to be revived. Their society is based around twelve noble houses, one of which is House Jhereg. The Jhereg do 'work' for the right price (everyth"

(The whole series features in Jo Walton's series of posts on Tor.com/in her collection of those posts in book-form, and was one of the ones from the list I made while reading it that I have underlined several times as a priority.) Still, I wasn't sure enough, so I only ordered the first omnibus, which contains the first three books. Ten chapters in, I ordered the rest. Unfortunately,"

Unfortunately, this book frustrated me with it's gross attempt to be cooler than the reader. The narrator is one of the more obvious Gary Sues that I've ever seen, but the story was interesting enough during the preface to keep me r"
2771,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,"This book was a pleasant surprise. Friends had read and loved it, which is why I picked it up. But I'd read The Incrementalists first and though I loved the concept, I didn't like the execution. This book, I loved. I'm a sucker for tales of assassins, so it had me there. Assassins with personality? Bonus points. A mystery to be solved, I'm hooked. Add in humour and complexity of both character and plot, and I couldn't put this down. A note on the narration. It was odd. Bernard Setaro Clark has a"
2772,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2,Ever play D & D with the kid who wants to be the half-elf wizard/assassin/ranger because he loves everything and can't decide? That's what this unfocused fantasy landscape reminds me of. The author and I don't share the same sensibilities as to what makes for a good fantasy world. I'm not sure when it started but (view spoiler) [ dragon eggs and psychic familiars have become cliche to me. (hide spoiler) ] Had I read this as a young person I might have liked it.
2775,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"A very fun book, easy to read and did not feel at all dated for having been written over 30 years ago. Feels very much like a mix of The Riyria Chronicles and The Dresden Files set in a mafia-like setting. Bought most of the series before I'd even finished it. looking forward to reading more!"
2776,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,"This is such a hard book to talk about. Cory and Kathie will know exactly what I mean. But usually when you talk about books you discuss the setting (especially in fantasy), the characters, the plot. With all of the Vlad Taltos books, though, you open your mouth to say something and you find that you have to stop. Two reasons: 1) The world-building in these books is so intricate and detailed that it's insane. It's also done so very subtly that you never feel like you're in the midst of an info-du"
2777,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,Easy read. But nothing gripping here.
2778,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,"So, you know how it is when a friend recommends you a book, and you get it and then they’re all like, “Well, do you love it? Do you love it?” And maybe you've not started reading yet so a thin haze of panic settles over you. What if you hate it? What do you say then? So, when I received this book as a birthday gift from a very good friend of mine I was excited at first and then I was all like, “Oh, shoot. What if I absolutely hate this book?” I need not have worried, because I freakin’ loved thi"
2779,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"3.5 my final vote for this one. Honestly, I almost gave up half way through. I was lost like a babe in the woods. Wasn't sure I was reading the first one in the series,...'cause maybe there was at least a prequel. Nooo? Checked 3 times. Hmph... yes, book one. All those Houses , names , history and allusions on past events, felt like recaps for someone who read the previous books in a series. Thankfully the main characters were cool and fun enough, to bring me till the end of the book. There was"

Can Vladimir find a way out that doesn't besmirch his friend's honour or lead to an all out war between three factions of the empire? Unfortunately, he doesn't have much time, a matter of days before all hell breaks loose... A light, easy read in an interesting world. A simple narrative structure that that sets up the framework of the impossible situation and then we see how it might be"
2781,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2,"I have heard a lot of hype about this novel. It is allegedly ""quick with both sword and wit,"" and the protagonist is supposed to be ""archly sophisticated and wryly humorous"" as well as selflessly heroic. I found myself disappointed. There were maybe two whole lines that made me laugh out loud, and on the whole the humor was forced and flat (unless you like repeatedly reading ""Shut up, Loiosh.""). The setting was vague, and although society seems intriguingly complicated, so much of its structure i"
2782,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,"No Spoiler. This is a series I came across years ago and never picked up to read. Since I have been reading several first series books of late, I thought it was time. This book is a first person narrative, with Vlad Taltos an assassin-criminal type guiding us through a world of organizations or houses. Jhereg is the name of the house he belongs to. The story essentially takes us through a assassination commission he receives from a very powerful ruler in his house, and the efforts that Vlad must"
2783,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,"Reminded me of Scott Lynch's Gentleman Bastards books, which of course this pre-dates, but I read those first. But maybe the better point of comparison is Lois McMaster Bujold's Miles Vorkosigan books. So, yeah, lovable rogue in a fantasy setting. And though there's sorcery and witchcraft and dragons, or, more accurately, jheregs, (who are, like, mini-dragons? Or something?) this is fundamentally a caper novel. Which is a thing that I love. Our hero is really good at his job (assassin), but he f"
2784,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,"Assassin nonsense in a fantasy land where death is generally not final and humans are the minority. Yeah, I know everyone loves these books, but did you love the first one? Because I thought this was inoffensive but also uninteresting, and there was this overbaked convolution to the whole thing that made me think I ought to be reading it out of the super sekrit writing notebooks of a high school kid who plays a lot of D&D. Not like there’s anything wrong with D&D, just, you know. Random r"
2785,Jhereg,Steven Brust,1,"This book has first-book-itis. Bad pacing, bad dialogue, bad outtakes, a shift from third person to third person omniscient with abandon. It had sort of an interesting idea about this high level mobster/Baron messing with more high level people and pulling off a heist to kill a guy who couldn't be killed. It has a nice fight in the end but it spends almost 200 pages trying to figure out what it wants to be when it grows up. The book is mostly ""BEHOLD MY WORLD! IS IT NOT WORLDLY?"" But in the end,"
2786,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,A nice fun quick fantasy tale with lots of action and magic throughout the story. I like the world building and the characters introduced in this tale and hope to read more of this author. 4 Stars for a fun read.
2787,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,"My cousin introduced me to this book. Like when I was 12. I'm way way more than twelve now. I remember reading the first chapter or maybe two when I spent a night at his house. I never did get any further than that. Recently, I was reminded of the book and so picked it up. I'm only kind of glad I did. I kind of like Vlad, but he seems shallow to me just acting instead of feeling. I only kind of like his buddy... uh... what's his name. For the same reason, he has one defining characteristic, he c"
2789,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,"I wasn't sure what to expect on this time through. It's been 20-30 years since I read this for the first time, and there have been plenty of old favorites that haven't held up to a reread. I'm happy to report that I had a lot of fun with this book. There is a lot of information and world building that has to be given to the reader, but the author does a nice job of folding that into enough action that it doesn't bog down the story. The characters and humor are as good as I remember and the writi"
2790,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"Lots of reviews of this on the site already, the first of the popular Vlad Taltos series by Steven Brust. For mw it falls into the same category as the Garrett books of Glen Cook – a modern feeling take on fantasy, with the subject being a hitman rather than a PI. A pleasant easy read, with a nice puzzle base set in a well envisaged world. Not rushing to read more, but I probably will as time presents itself."
2792,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"The first of the Vlad Taltos novels, Jhereg, by Steven Brust has been on my “to-read” list for the better part of a decade and a half. Back in August, Audible.com released Jhereg (and just about all the other Vlad Taltos novels, via their increasingly impressive Audible Frontiers label. Jhereg introduces the readers to the assassin Vlad Taltos. Living in amongst a race of tall long-lived sorcerers called Dragaerans, Vlad has risen to a station of respect and power (if of a limited variety) despi"
2793,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,Highly entertaining and also unlike 80s book. Just enough details to get the story moving. Interesting world building too. I like how different creatures are given unique names. The writing is intelligent and very engaging. The dialogues are also good. The narrator is also nice. Highly recommend audiobook to anyone. Planning to continue the series through next year.
2795,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"A mystery/police procedural disguised as a fantasy novel. Nicely plotted and extremely readable, fun, and fast-paced. Brust never slows down to cram in some fantastical element, magic and dragons and the like are carefully woven in such that we get a glimpse of the larger world as the circumstances of the crime are unraveled. Lots of books in this series and lots more by Steven Brust (this was his debut), I'll likely read more."
2796,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"A good book to dip into for a few hours, it's engaging and fun centered around an interesting main character."
2799,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The writing was smooth as butter and Vlad was well worth the price of admission. He's not the toughest or strongest or best fighter but he can out think his opponents and that makes him supremely interesting. Not to mention he's pretty damn likeable
2800,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,"Definitely not what I was expecting (especially from high fantasy), but in the best way! Excellent comedic timing, interactions between characters, and world building. Also, such a clever plot, and I loved the way the mechanics of the world were revealed -- very slowly, but not so slow that I found myself confused past the point of understanding what going on. I cannot wait to start the next book!"
2801,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"This is the first written Vlad Taltos-book and the fourth in the current internal chronological order. After reading the previous ones I have to admit that this is the one to start the series with. It’s full of background information which isn’t told either extensively or at all about Vlad, his job and family, the world, the Great Weapons, and everything. The book is short, quick to read, fast paced, and full of plot twists and witty banter. Vlad owns his own small sector of the city of Adrilankh"
2802,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"Steven Brust's Jhereg is the first in a long series of books, focuses on the adventures of Vlad Taltos, a witty, amiable, and ruthless assassin belonging to the House of Jhereg. He is accompanied by his familiar, Loiosh, and his shamed-Dragon assistant, Kragar, among a host of other characters in this truly epic cast. The central plot of this book is that Vlad must find a way to kill a man who has stolen from the House of Jhereg, without betraying his employer's oath that the man will not be har"
2804,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,"I've always been a fan of the anti-hero type character, and I do believe that Vlad Taltos may just be a new favorite. Born a lowly human in a world ruled by long-lived elves (Dragaerans) Vlad becomes a sort of low-level crimelord for his ""family"" the Jhereg who are just one of seventeen Great Houses. He is an exemplary hired killer, a minor sorcerer, and a witch. It is through his witchcraft that he gains his wisecracking telepathic familiar Loiosh a small winged dragonlike lizard called a jhere"
2805,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"Cynical assassin is a pretty well-worn fantasy trope at this point, and the Dragaerans are pretty much reskinned elves-but-gritty. Yet Burst manages to breathe some new life into old stereotypes for a clever, witty romp. A lot of the appeal is voice--Vlad is every bit the too-clever-and-arrogant-for-his-own-good antihero we've gotten used to in urban fantasy, but that doesn't mean the trope doesn't continue to be fun. And Vlad is an unusually funny version, even when things get a little dark. (Th"
2806,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2,"I decided to read this book because I love assassins and dragons, and this has both. I liked the world for the most part, but the writing style was what really killed it for me. First, the world was interesting and different. There was a lot of everything, which was kind of annoying (assassins and emperors and dragons and reincarnation and Great Weapons and soul-eating weapons and witchcraft and sorcery and and and...). It's okay when there are a few ""specialties"" to make the world interesting, b"
2807,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"My reading was starting to slow down, and I realized that the stuff I was reading was too downer and artsy. I needed a good rollickin' adventure for a change. Terran has recommended the Vlad Taltos series repeatedly as fun fantasy adventure from his youth. We own that series, and it is not in boxes waiting for us to finish building bookcases, so I decided to give it a try. The first book, while it reads like a rookie effort in some ways, really is brilliant. Vlad is a great narrator with a great"
2808,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,"Oh my gosh. This book was so refreshing! Why, you ask? 1. Vlad is already married. No romance crap blocking out the action and intrigue! 2. Vlad is HAPPILY married! OMG he doesn't flirt with everything with boobs and a face! He clearly loves his wife. 3. Lots of strong female characters doing things to help move the plot/action forward. They are necessary to resolve the conflict. They do this without flirting with or being flirted with by Vlad. 4. No super long backstory descriptions. We're given re"
2809,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,"Millions of things have been said about this book. I won't try to write a ""useful"" review. This is mostly for my own memory. I reread this book recently, and while I remembered vaguely the overall plot, and that I thoroughly enjoyed it, I was again blown away by a few moments, moments that I should not have forgotten. Perhaps it's because I loved ""Teckla"" so much more that this one kind of faded to just a pleasant-but-indistinct memory, but there's so damn much that's good about this. Vlad's cha"
2810,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,"This book begins the series about the adventures of Vlad the assassin. The series is wildly uneven, with a few really weak entries, but the best novels in the group are some of the most original fantasy out there. The best of the series are fast, funny, irreverent, and wildly creative. The books take place on another world, where humans co-exist with Draegarans, a race of tall, aggressive and extremely long-lived humanoids - basically ""elves,"" but not like you've ever seen them before. The world"
2811,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2,"Meh. I really hope this series gets better. But this first book in the series really didn't do it for me. I found the characters one dimensional at best, and the plot not all that gripping. Then there was the writing style: ""Lady Teldra was tall, beautiful, and graceful as a dzur. Her eyes were as soft as an iorich's wing..."" Well, that doesn't really tell me how graceful she was, or how soft her eyes were, given that I don't have the foggiest clue what a dzur or an iorich is! All in all, the ne"
2812,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,"One of my favorite fantasy series and writers of all time. He jumps back forth in the heroes timeline between books, just to keep you wanting a little longer to find out what happens next. Oh fine. But it works, it's fun to drop in on a fully developed character in this book and tag along on his assassin witch with a wise-cracking tiny dragon familiar who is the *actual* main character IMO adventure. Now, if I only knew the correct way to say his name. Loy-Oash? Lo-e-osh? L-o-e-o-sh? Forget it,"
2813,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"Second time reading this novel, a quick read due to the first person narration of Vlad Taltos. A light-hearted book that grabbed by taking a number of fantasy tropes--enchanted swords, animal familiars, sorcery, etc--and using them in a detective/mystery type of story. I could remember key things from years ago, such as how Taltos meets Loiosh, the early scene at the restaurant, but not how they finally nail the bad guy at the end. Good stuff and I am moving onto the second novel."
2814,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,"Folks there are reasons I own every book Brust has written. In the spirit of Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser , a solid Swords n Sorcery backdrop - but essentially the tale of good guy, as screwed up and conflicted as the rest of us trying to get by in a rough and weird town. Lot of Andre Dumas! Raymond Chandler / Dashiell Hammett sprinkled around, maybe a hint of Rex Stout."
2815,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,A fun read... I now understand all the hype I've been hearing about Steven Brust . And I almost forgive him the error in judgment that is The Phoenix Guards .
2816,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,"I had hard time reading and finishing this book. It was refering to many people and places and specifics of the world that I wasn't familiar with. Also Jhereg is a place, but jhereg is a race and an animal...? I am just generally confused by this. Maybe I should have read some other book from this world first."
2817,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"This was the first time I'd read any books by Steven Brust, and I quite enjoyed it. I feel as if I've gotten just a taste of a complex world, and yet I learned what was needed for THIS plot. I certainly want to know more, however. The setting up of a complex 'job' while avoiding huge pitfalls was enjoyable, and I liked the wry, humorous tone."
2818,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"Just as good this time as the last time I read it so long ago. Although this was the first of the series to be written, it definitely paid off to have read in chronological order first this time around. Sure, there are a few inconsistencies between this and the later books, but it was still better than bouncing around in time."
2819,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,"Read in the early-to-mid '90s, re-read this year. Good, solid, noir science-fantasy pulp, set in a world so far in the future it's more like the far distant past. Satirized in this Penny Arcade comic: http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/200..."
2820,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,Is it just me or are all the wizards/sorcerers/man witches getting upset stomachs all the time? It that a thing? Maybe it's a plot device so that they can fail without being incompetent. Or almost fail so that the story is more exciting.
2821,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2,"I picked this up because of the high star rating on Goodreads, but in this case the masses are mistaken. Jhereg is a badly written book with linear, low-stakes plotting and paper characters whose sense of humor perpetually falls flat."
2822,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"Really enjoyed this one. A quick, fun, entertaining, short fantasy/detective story with great action and humor. It didn't scream ""this is a book written in the 80s"" (like some books from that time period do). I guess there isn't much to say except I liked it and will read more of this series."
2823,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,"Meh. Flat characters. An entirely forgettable story. Pretty much non-existent worldbuilding. The book was fun, and I appreciated the lighthearted tone, so it's not a total bust, but I will not be continuing this series."
2824,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"Sardonic, energetic, characterful."
2825,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,pretty good overall. nice pacing and stuff.
2826,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,Wow. What a fun little book. Wish I'd read this a long time ago! I've a feeling I'm going to devour this series. This is exactly my kind of fantasy. Perfect reading!
2827,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,A pleasure to read.
2828,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,Awesome book. Among the greatest stories I've ever had the pleasure of reading.
2829,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"Little lacking by today's standards, but still very good. For its time... amazing. http://www.staffersbookreview.com/201..."
2830,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2,I kept waiting for this book to get interesting or compelling and it never ever did.
2831,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,"A fascinating fantasy noir/adventure romp through a world of assassins, wizards, and mob bosses."
2833,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,Fantastic book! I can't believe it isn't more popular.
2834,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2,"the story was fine, it just was not my cup of tea."
2835,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,"The writing style of this book is extremely dialogue heavy and efficient with description. The fun of reading Jhereg is not due to flowery descriptions, the fun of reading Jhereg is in the character interaction and the world building. When Vlad, the main character, enters a room, you know what he thinks about that room and a bit of what makes the room special or what plot elements are in it. It is the other characters in this book that get the most attention, not the scenery. Almost everything th"
2836,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2,"Book is in the first person perspective of the young man Vlad Taltos. A human in this fantasy land with dragons and various clans of humanoid races sort of like the Tolkien elves. Yeah, so far not of to a good start as I'm not the biggest fan of first person perspective in books as it limits the story telling and the premis of the book is the exact same of all other standard fantasy novels, i.e a young white dark haired male humanoid\human with extreme skills or powers. Seen it a thousand times"
2837,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,"Vlad Taltos is a human on a world dominated by dragaerans. Human in appearance, dragaerans are different from humans in a few ways -- most notably, dragaerans are much taller and live for centuries rather than decades. While there's a fair amount of prejudice towards members of different dragaeran Houses, most are united in their disdain for humans. And yet, Vlad has managed to thrive. There's a good deal of criminal activity in the Jhereg and when you need someone taken out, he's one of the bes"
2838,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"I'm a bit of an idiot. For some reason (the weird name in the titled, weirdly spelled, plus the series' name, plus some one sentence descriptions I must have picked up at some point in time) I had always believed this series to be Science Fiction about a Planet of Psychic Vampires. I was sure of it, the same way that, despite not having read, say, ""Crumpets With a Spot of Death: A Margie Doobs Mystery"", I would be sure that it would be a cozy mystery with characters who eat dessert and own cats."
2839,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2,"I really wanted to like this. I'd heard a lot of good things recently and it sounded right up my alley. I was very intrigued by the fantasy-noir setting. I just don't think it worked for me, but it showed a lot of promise. Straight away I was hooked by the prologue. I liked the feel of the world and the ceremony needed for Vlad to get the egg which would eventually be Loiosh, faithful familiar. But the austere promise of that scene was let down immensely by practically everything else. For one, L"
2840,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"I wish I could rate this a 5 as it is the start of my favorite series and it holds a special place in my memory as I read it when I was really young. However, after reading this a lot of times I can see some of the flaws this novel has as many first novels in a long running series are. At times the exposition is a bit out of nowhere and unprompted. There are other times the humor is just crass and flashbacks can seem crammed in, but for all of this the story is clever and was really ahead of its"
2841,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,"I wanted to rate this higher since it really was an enjoyable read, however it lacked a few things that would have made it five-star. Overall, it was an entertaining, quick read that was easy to follow with characters you could easily learn and had unique personalities. I really enjoyed the perspective of Vlad's experience as an assassin, and how, despite it being his profession, he got nervous or suffered side-effects. That said, however, there wasn't a lot about this story that was original. The"
2842,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2,"When reading Fantasy one expects the author to have some good imagination. Jhereg has little fantasy and little imagination. I gave the author over 200 pages' chance to present this world to me and it didn't happen. A good example of this lack of imagination are the domestic scenes, where you see husband and wife dining together. It's just a present day, middle class home. No attempt to imagine what impact this world with elves and dragons and pseudo-deaths actually have on people. The author ju"
2843,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"This appears to be the first book in the series, yet it takes place later in Vlad's life, so there's quite a bit of back story that I know little about. This wasn't a huge problem because the writer sprinkled enough information, without resorting to info-dumps, to make the story easy to follow. The plot turned out to be fairly complicated. Vlad is hired to do a job within a short time limit. The job has several complicating factors, including one that could alienate a good friend. The final plan"
2844,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,"This was quite an enjoyable read. It starts out like fairly standard 80's fantasy, but after the first chapter, everything changes. it's actually more of a hitman/crime novel, but it has a surprising amount of worldbuilding for a short book. It's also very progressive for the 80's, with well balanced female characters, and a main character that's not afraid to rely on others. One minor point I really enjoyed: at first I thought the concept of instant telepathy with anyone the characters know was"
2845,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,"A fun fantasy story from a huge series set in Brust's world of houses connected to creatures real and fantastic: Dragaera. While this isn't the first book he wrote for the series, it is the first in the reprinted collections (The Book of Jhereg being the first) and a good place to start with his somewhat cynical assassin, Vlad Taltos, and Vlad's sarcastic familiar, the jhereg Loiosh. These aren't epic fantasies; each is less than 200 pages. But, that doesn't mean Brust doesn't throw a bit of phi"
2846,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,"I was talking about SF books with an acquaintance of mine. He mentioned this author as a favorite, and when I mentioned I hadn't read any and asked where to start, this is what he suggested. Someone who actually reads SF was exciting enough that I put the book on home. Actually, he suggested a three volume book, but, man, one was about enough. It was ... fine? But I didn't like the main character, and didn't really care about his struggles, and, man, the book never convinced me to care. (Despite"
2847,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"4 stars (recommended for anyone who likes this type of book). I never read this series when it was first published but stumbled upon it through several lists of top fantasy series. After reading Jhereg, the first in the series. I am a fan. The main character, Vlad, is bad-ass but still has a conscience, and his sarcasm and humor is quite fun. The story moved along briskly, with an enjoyable sense of mystery as well as political intrigue. The other characters included a great mixture of different"
2848,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,"I like the characters, the story was exciting, but forgive me for saying, Brust is a lazy writer. When recapping a conversation to another character, don’t just write something like “I told her what was said.” That doesn’t happen in real life. You don’t have to repeat the entire conversation, but you might consider going over the pertinent details. So, my standard for “a good book” has been to ask if I am going to read the next book. I don’t think I am just yet. I think I’m going to spend some m"
2850,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,"Vlad the Witch with the smartass familiar, Vlad the Crime Boss, Vlad the Assassin, Vlad the friend to Dragaerans, a tall, imposing, basically immortal race. Vlad is the minority in so many ways. This is a quick read, and a fun one. Brust introduces us to complex world, and hints at other stories from the outset, whetting our appetites for more. The story works because it's constrained. Vlad systematically solves his problems, to have others thrown in his path. The scale grows until the finale, wh"
2852,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"While this novel is just a small introduction type story the world promises to be complex and filled with chaos. There promises to be lots of history to explore, houses to destroy in furture novels. In this the first book in the series, of which I plan to read more, we meet Vlad Taltos, an assassin. He's put in a position where he has to use his brain as much, probably more, than his steel. The plot is intriguing, the characters are enjoyable and looking forward to reading more of the series."
2853,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"I guess I need to just accept the fact that I'm a Fantasy reader. I've resisted that label for a long time, but obviously I must get SOMETHING out of it, or else I wouldn't keep tackling them. And yet... this one kinda falls outside of that genre. So maybe I only like Fantasy books that have other genres mixed in, for instance (like this one): a caper novel. There's lots of interesting ideas in here, and I think that I'm going to start adding in some other books from the series to my list to read"
2854,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"A high-fantasy, darkly humorous classic about a society of sorcerous and political Houses that often plot against one another. I remember thinking how super unique it felt when I read it as a kid, and it still holds up. Be wary though that you're dealing with characters that can use telepathy, teleport, and even resurrect each other is some cases, but I only found one of the instances of genetic magic to be tacky plot armor. Would recommend to fans of the Elric saga or Salvatore's Dark Elf Trilo"
2855,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"It's been a while since I read a good, sturdy, traditional fantasy, and this was quite an enjoyable foray back into that forest. By traditional I don't mean that it's boring or cliche, just structured in a particular familiar sort of way--but with enough quirks and unique concepts to make it interesting. Coupled with an engaging and likable narrator, this was quite a fun ride! Excited to read more of this series."
2856,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2,"Sci-fi in a world where everything and anything is possible. Well-written, and the author keeps things moving along. But because the world has no physical laws, there are no boundaries on what is possible. Characters use magic and sorcery, and can be reanimated if killed. As a result pretty much every plot revolves around a type of deus ex machina, employing a supernatural power that was previously unknown to the reader. No desire to continue in the series."
2857,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"I really really enjoy Steven Brust. He has good women characters and his fantasy world seems to have generally nailed gender equality. Also they're really fun books overall, and this was no different. My favorites are the pedantically narrated ones (The Phoenix Guards, 500 Years After) because the historian is hilariously defensive and I enjoy that, but so far I'm really enjoying the Vlad Taltos ones too. On to the next!"
2858,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2,"(Dug review out of the depths of LiveJournal.) This was not a quick read, despite its 182 pages. It took me a while to get into the book, and even after I felt like I had, there were still some off-putting things (""work"" always always being in quotation marks when it was never necessary in the first place, for one). It's OK stock fantasy, with the assassin element giving it some slightly better-than-normal edge, but I don't think I'll read any more after the other two in the same volume."
2859,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"Thoroughly enjoyed this short but excellent book. Vlad is a fun character that reminds me a bit of Harry Dresden, but is different enough to keep me interested (unlike other Dresden clones). I also really like the worldbuilding, and that fact that Brust doesn't spoonfeed the reader. Some of the world feels weird, and it's supposed to. You figure things out with time. This book was super fun, and short enough that I may try to knock out a few more before the end of the year. Recommended for fans o"
2860,Jhereg,Steven Brust,1,"After a very promising first chapter, this book is simply BORES YOU TO DEATH. Standing in a room and talking...then standing in an other room and talking...then sitting in an other room, and talking.... Confusing and boring... It takes likes 150 pages until the writer cares to explain how does the Draegarans(?) look like, however they are there since the first pages..."
2861,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,"This was a listen of an old favorite, and was a treat. Performed by Bernard Setaro Clark, who does a wonderful job telling the story, and providing different voices for the main characters. I look forward to revisiting the rest of the series on audio (which, by the way, helps me with the oft-Hungarian pronunciations :-) )"
2862,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,"Pretty solid read. Not what I'd consider a ""standout"" title as some of what I've read recently. I like Vlad's character, but the world which the story inhabits is a bit well-trodden and a bit boring for my tastes. The PoV is a little narrow, but I'm not discounting it for other readers. I give Jhereg a 3.5/5"
2864,Jhereg,Steven Brust,1,"initial reaction: Mary Sue rides again! two chapters in: holy shit, Mary Sue isn't even -riding- this time, her foot's just stuck in the stirrup and she's getting dragged through a swamp of horrible writing."
2865,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,"This book is like a cold Coca-Cola during lunch on a random Thursday. A treat without much substance. It passes the time for sure, but when death has no stakes and every character (such that they are differentiated) is a super-being, you tend not to care what happens."
2866,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"I found this book to be really intriguing. I particularly liked the main character's narration, which made me feel as if I ""knew"" him quite early on in the book and so I found myself invested in the action. I listened to the audible version and the presentation was very good."
2868,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,Fast pace crime syndicate thriller in very interesting fantasy world. In some episodes I would even say that story was too short and I would have liked to know more details about the universe setup and background of characters i hope all my questions get answered in next volumes in series.
2869,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"One of my husband's favorite series, with some wonderfully interesting characters. I suspect I would like to read this more than listen to the audio, as it is quite action filled. The voice artist was excellent, I really enjoyed his voices."
2870,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,"A very fun, delightful and quick read. I was going to knock it down to four-stars for the, what I felt, clumsy introduction to the main character's wife, but the sarcasm, laughter and humanness throughout more than makes up for it! Enjoyable read for sure."
2871,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,"A high fantasy Harry Dresden, or a mafia Corwin of Amber. The Jhereg series is a deep fantasy world with a wise cracking assassin as the main lead. If you like Jim Butcher, Douglas Adams, Roger Zelazny, Robert Aspirin, Patricia Briggs, give Steven Brust a go!"
2872,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,"Has potential. You've got to take the early stuff for what it is, I reckon: practice. Interesting character, fast paced, very sparse on setting (hence - 2 stars, because I couldn't picture the place or society clearly). Anyway, on to the next!"
2873,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,"This book is a highly entertaining fantasy novel about an assassin who takes a job and comes to realize that much more going on than he originally realized. Brust's writing style is so immersive that it makes this book nearly impossible to put down. This book is so much fun to read and is addictively entertaining. I actually liked the way you are just thrust into Vlad's life with hardly any explanation. You slowly get to know him, his friends, and his organization while he is trying to complete a"
2874,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"Light, fun hook, skips forward in time a fair bit but also fills in details on the world it describes Recommended"
2876,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,"I’ve judged this book by the cover and passed it dozens of times. When it was recommended I read it more dutiful than hopeful, but it was really great. Fantasy and noir, a lot of fun!"
2877,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,"Really more of a 3.5. It kept me intrigued and interested and I plan to keep reading in the series, although perhaps not right away. The narration was very good, and the world Brust creates is kind of fascinating. I also like that he's pretty skilled at providing the background info needed in small chunks as needed rather than clumsy long history lessons. Definitely wanting to learn more about Vlad Taltos and his past. Note: I haven't been keeping track of this in my reviews, but this is one of t"
2878,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,"An assassin takes on a difficult job in a setting where all of the characters are so OP that no one is (and, amusingly, people tend to come back from the dead unless you go significantly out of the way to prevent this from happening). The tone goes all-in on cleverness, which may appeal to some people but left me feeling sort of empty; there’s not much emotion to be found, and despite having first-person POV the narration comes across as rather detached."
2879,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,"Honestly, I love the absolute crap out of this series. Brust has such a great voice on the page, and the characters are just fantastic. This is one of the best ones in the series, too."
2880,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,3rd time reading Jhereg. Still love it.
2881,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,Always great. Mafia story meets Fantasy world.
2882,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"It's Ocean's 11, but instead of a casino it's a medieval fantasy city full of humans and part-dragons. Also, instead of a heist it's an assassination. Wit abounds."
2883,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,A fun read. Detective/assassin novel set in a fantasy world with a pet dragon that communicates via telepathy? Dial me in.
2884,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,Great opening to an epic that had me trying to stay one step ahead of Vlad (and failing) throughout the novel. Looking forward to the next 16.
2885,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"A few places seemed a bit jumpy and rushed, but overall it was an enjoyable book and I liked the characters. I'll definitely be continuing."
2886,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,Hired assassin with a jhereg on his shoulder outwits the target with the help of some friends.
2887,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,A compelling take in a rich world. Reading about an assassin who's main strength is his network of friends and contacts was a treat. Will probably spend the next year reading the rest of the series.
2888,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,Great fun. Reminds me of the days when you could read a while book in a week and actually wanted to.
2889,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,"Hardboiled-Detective-Magic-Assassin-Fantasy-SF?! If that is a genre, Steven Brust's first Vlad Taltos novel, Jhereg (1983), is a progenitor. Vlad Taltos, the hardboiled but sensitive first person narrator, is a 21-year-old assassin-spy security-chief crime-boss skilled with blades, conversant with poisons, expert with witchcraft, and bonded with a telepathically impudent but faithful familiar, a dragon-like scavenger jhereg named Loiosh. Humans like Vlad are a second-class minority in the City o"
2890,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,Good stuff. Fantasy classic
2891,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"One of the small pleasures in life is enjoying a book and knowing that it is the first in a long series. Jhereg didn't change my life, but it provided a few fun evenings."
2892,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,"Vlad Taltos is a human assassin working for the House of Jhereg. Near the start of the book, he receives a very difficult and unusual contract for a former member of the Jhereg Council who ran off with nine million of the House’s funds. What follows is a twisty puzzle set in a strange and sometimes confusing world. Overall, I enjoyed Jhereg, but I had real trouble getting into it. For one thing, I wasn’t expecting the sort of story I got. The cover and blurb make it out to be what I think of as “"
2893,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,"A solid start to this series. You've got magical assassins, political machinations, strange beasts, and engaging characters. Some of the prose is a little awkward, but this was a worthwhile read."
2894,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2,Jhereg is the first book in a well loved fantasy series that started in the 80s though honestly the book itself felt pretty contemporary I kind of want to call it YA but overall I think the book may be a bit too dry for that. Jhereg takes place in a loosely urban setting on a planet called dragaera which is mostly inhabited by sorceress called dragaerans. Beings that can live for thousands of years most dragaerans are attached to one of seventeen houses all of which have a different set of ideal
2895,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,"When a council member of the Jhereg's has stolen 9 million, Vlad Taltos is called in to take him down. But it's not going to be an easy task when he finds out that his target has taken refuge in one of an untouchable castle. Trickery needs to be done, and he's on a clock. I enjoyed this book in the sense that it was a very quick, easy, and fun read. It didn't have much substance besides introducing a new world with its specific quirks and rules. But discovering a world is always fun. This is a pa"
2896,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,"When reading, I sometimes get caught up with the wrong pronunciation, and I have a far too hard time letting go, even when someone corrects me. I’m thankful that Brust was kind enough to provide a pronunciation guide at the start of Jhereg ; this way I hopefully won’t embarrass myself when discussing the book with anyone, getting a significant name horribly wrong, such as the title. I originally picked up a beat-up old copy of Jhereg a year ago at a used-book store. I read through the prologue, an"
2897,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,This is a fantastic book and I highly recommend it if you want a fun read that doesn't constantly regurgitate the standard fantasy tropes. The series is very well done and still continues to have solid additions. I originally read this book while I was in med school (borrowed it and a couple of the others in the series from a friend who recommended it) about 20 years ago. I've started re-reading the series recently and it's standing up well to the re-read. It's also useful because it's helping m
2898,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,"4/5 Stars Pretty decent book, even though it was written more than 25 years ago. I had a nice time with it, not exciting times but enjoyable enough that I didn't feel checking the remaining time from now and then. The book tells the story of a human called Vlad Taltos living in a fantasy world filled with long lived elf-like creatures and dragons, among other things. Sorcery and witchcraft is also very much alive here. For instance, the fastest way to move between places is to cast a teleportatio"
2899,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"I'm writing this review a month or so after I read the actual book, so please, bear with me when it comes to some lapses, plot-wise. What's always attracted me to Brust is that he brings a very florid touch to his fantasy. Fantasy and sci-fi are sometimes dismissed as genres that pay more attention to world-building than descriptive quality (sci-fi more than fantasy, since fantasy has the foundational example of Tolkien), but Brust is unabashedly literary. The first book of his I ever read was i"
2900,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"Every time I reread this series, I want to add another star. Funny, since this is the first ""official"" Goodreads read I've done of this. I've tried changing editions; it keeps showing me a cover I've never seen in my life. Doesn't matter; the covers I've seen for this series are my vote for Most Inaccurate But Still Cool Covers Ever. This one I see is inaccurate and also horrible. (Unless it's an amber-colored dragon-esque thing coming out of an egg---then it's the cover I know.) It's supposed to"
2901,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,"Vlad Taltos is a mobster and assassin, and he's just landed a contract so lucrative he'll be set for life. If, that is, he doesn't botch the job. Because this time his target is also a Jhereg, who knows how the game is played. It won't be an easy kill, but if he can't pull it off, Vlad won't be alive to worry about the consequences . . . I FINALLY got my hands on a copy of Jhereg, which I immediately devoured. It's hard to believe this is the first book, and that's not just because Steven Brust w"
2902,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,"In the 1980’s there was really only one kind of fantasy to speak of. All of it was, almost universally, a Tolkien ripoff. Then Steven Brust entered the scene with something that came from so far to the left that to this day people don’t really know how to take it. Jhereg is about a man living in a kingdom of demigods who live hundreds of thousands of years. There is no quest, there is very little travel, Vlad is not an uneducated scullery boy (though he does start out waiting tables in his fathe"
2903,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2,"Two things: I wish I had read this in the 80s when it came out and was fresh among all the Tolkien clones; and dammit, I should have checked whether this series differs between publication and internal chronology order. I much prefer to read in IC order, and much happens between the start of this book and the actual story beginning 7 years later that is left completely unexplained, which feels enormously distancing to me -- Vlad Taltos apparently gets married; but falling in love, courtship, and"
2904,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,"When I first read (= listened to) this book, I rated it four stars. But the rating went up with the reread and I'm a little bit obsessed now. The learning curve of the Taltos books is relatively steep and the form of the story (and the fact that the books weren't released in chronological order) means that there are a lot of events alluded to, that the new reader can have no knowledge of (yet). The prose and the voice of the character (first person narration) are also not something I'd normaly gr"
2905,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"I'm a Vlad Taltos fan for many, many years. I've read the entire series (yes, even the way-off-his-game ones, #3-6) multiple times. Over the holidays, on a long drive, I thought the first volume would be a fun read for the family, so I read it aloud to them over the course of seven hours or so. It's still a faboo read, with a ton of fun going for it. But this time through, I was aware of a few weaknesses in this first-in-the-series novel that Brust later gets a heck of a lot better at. On the plus"
2906,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,"Steven Brust is by far my favorite author. I have read every one of his books, some of them several times. I truly enjoy the worlds he has created in his novels. Jhereg was the first one to capture me and it was one of his first books. It tells the story of a young assassin trying to make his way in the world. From the very first passage, I was completely enchanted; it quickly & skillfully drew me in, heart and soul. Brust writes with wit, humor and charm, colorfully describing characters, s"
2907,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"In General You should really read this book xD I'm pretty sure it's a YA book, by the way. Regarding the Plot The plot was really cool :D Vlad was hired to assassinate Mellar (look at description) but basically he runs into a bunch of really interesting (to me) obstacles, such as the fact that Mellar is holed up inside of a castle who's guests are protected. You are not allowed to kill them permanently (you can revive people from the dead if their soul isn't removed) but Vlad needs to do that in o"
2908,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"I love reading series. I love being immersed in characters that are too complex, or a world that has too much history, for one book. I love it when an author has so much invested in their creation that, reading between the lines, you know there is so much more to reveal; I love it when the first book in the series only scratches the surface of what the author has imagined. Harry Potter is like this, so is the Vorkosigan series by Lois McMaster Bujold, the Pern series by Anne McCaffery, the Expan"
2909,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"Jhereg is a fun, fast paced story beginning the series about a criminal and assassin, Vlad Taltos. Vlad is a minor but rising player in the criminal house Jheryg, but stands out as a human in the Dragaeran (essentially elves) Empire. Most don't accept him, but the Jherygs will let anyone with talent and gold buy their way in. Vlad's life becomes complicated when one of the leaders of house Jheryg hires him for an assassination job, but one which seems impossible on the surface. The offer of 10 t"
2910,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"4,5 stars Some time ago I read a blog post called Five Books with Unforgettable Animal Sidekicks. Pretty fun post with many books I am familair with and then somebody in comments mentioned Vlad Taltos and his animal sidekick, Loiosh. And the more I read the more I got interested because: Loiosh is a small dragon! Loiosh is a dragon with personality of a cat!!! Loiosh has psychic bond with Vlad and has the snarkiest comments and observations! How can I resist that? The truth is, I am not sure I would g"
2911,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,A sarcastic mob boss in a world where elves are the superior class and humans are oppressed. Fast paced and entertaining with a bit of destiny sewn in the framework of the universe.
2912,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2,"Vlad Taltos is this guy, right, who has some buddies, and they get together and plan out this caper. He's a fairly typical protagonist in a fantasy novel. He has a little dragon sidekick, some elven friends, a magical weapon, etc. Vlad Taltos is a psychopath, and so is almost everyone he knows. Vlad himself has murdered 41 people for money. He casually orders a young woman murdered simply because she is spreading some rumors. His friend Morrollan worships a demon goddess and, blink and you will"
2913,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,"This is book One in the adventures of Vlad Taltos, an unlikely of heroes. The book begins with: “There is a similarity, if I may be permitted an excursion into the tenuous metaphor, between the feel of a chilly breeze and the feel of a knife’s blade, as either is laid across the back of your neck. I can call up memories of both, if I work at it. The chilly breeze is invariably going to be the more pleasant memory.” The world in this series started much like ours. But long long ago the Jenoine, po"
2914,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,"Initially, I was sad that I'd finished all the Locke Lamora books that had been written, to date. Despite its weird name, I was thrilled when I chanced to open and start reading Jhereg (Vlad Taltos #1) because it had a lot of elements in common with our dear friend Locke Lamora. And I was further thrilled that this is a series in which there are many books, so I do not have to say goodbye to series that feature: - a single male starring character - that has a seemingly mind-reading best friend/fam"
2915,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"This book is really clever. Like the central character it proves itself nimble and clever, a fantasy version of the 'heist movie' in a way, in which the protagonist has to come up with an overly elaborate cunning plan to get his objective... in this case to assassinate some-one. I found alot of elements of the world-building fascinating actually. Humans who live as a persecuted minority in an empire of super-long-lived beings. What assassination 'means' in a world where magical resurrection is co"
2917,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2,"I've been looking for a long, satisfying fantasy series to dig into, so I really wanted to love Jhereg , but sadly it was only competent, not awesome. Brust has a lot of things going for him. The mythology seems original, and well-constructed that I'd guess it unfolds slowly as the series goes on. The worldbuilding is excellent, too; Brust parcels it out in little chunks. The story is well-paced. What I like best, though, is that Brust is refreshingly unpretentious. As far as I can tell, Jhereg is"
2918,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2,"Entertaining but bleh. But it's purely because of my own personal hatred for that ""private eye"" style writing and the style of story telling that develops using untold stories! That's when a character refers to an event that happened at an early date, in order to reveal to the reader how experienced they are and how on the edge they live, without telling anything else worth a damn. It's when a character will say to another something like,""oh no. Not like the tower jumping in the George case"" the"
2919,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,"In this one, we meet Vlad for the first time and learn about the Jhereg and the Dragaera in general. We learn how Loiosh came to be with Vlad, as well as how Rocza came into their lives. The basic story is of an assassination Vlad must carry out. However, the target has taken refuge in Morrolan's Castle Black and as such he cannot be assaulted without incurring Morrolan's wrath. On the other hand, if he isn't taken out soon, the House of Jhereg will suffer permanent damage to their reputation and"
2920,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,"Let me start with a disclaimer: it's possible the rating on this was a touch lower than the quality of the work would indicate. I read this in a print omnibus edition. The book was heavy, the type was tiny, both made reading difficult given my severe arthritis. I'm including that in the review, though, because if a book is inaccessible or difficult to consume that's a barrier to the audience. I honestly don't know why Ace doesn't convert the first 8 books in the series to ebook. That being said,"
2921,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"I love when you read a book and you know the writer just had a big shit-eating grin on their face with every keypress. I feel like these books would be a hard sell to a lot of people I know, because they're just stupidly fun. Each book is short and snappy and reminds me a lot of the Dresden Files; there's a great supporting cast, there's awesome plots to unravel, there's deeper mysteries... Steven Brust loves writing, and this series so far (I've read four books) just reads like a labor of love."
2922,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"I was quite impressed with how much I liked this book, considering how often some books from the 70's and 80's don't hold up well! To start off with, I really loved the way the author built the world. There wasn't a ""straight man"" to explain everything to, but with the story being told from the recollection of the main character, there are plenty of places to explain something that's been mentioned a time or two, to flesh out the idea. The book is pretty short for what I normally like to read, and"
2923,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,"Jhereg by Steven Brust is a great book. It really gives you some insight as to what an assassin does and how he thinks. As the plot develops, the reader really gets a glimpse into the mind of Vlad Taltos and it feels as if we are struggling with him, trying to plan out how to get the guy. Brust also adds elements of comedy and fun into this seemingly dark book about assassination. We learn that Vlad isn't just a cold-hearted killer, but he does what he has to do to get by. As an easterner in the"
2924,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"It's been a while since I picked up a book that I have legitimately been unable to put down. This is a book that I picked up one evening and found myself reading until far to late in the morning. The story is great. I appreciated the way that Brust simply thrust me into his world. It's filled with unique, fantastic creatures that he takes no breath to explain to me. I had the feeling of someone truly stepping into a fantasy and constantly wondering ohhh what is THAT? The writing is not perfect. Th"
2925,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,"Jupp. I still give 5 stars. Actually I'm really relieved that I still love the story. There are a couple of books from my youth, which I really really liked back in the days and now they disappoint me. But not Vlad and Loiosh. I love the style the story is narrated in, it's refreshing and direct. Vlad has his flaws and strenghts. Lot's of Ego-Perspective-Narratives suffer from annoyingly perfect protagonists. Their stories are full of shining moments and how they handled everything with ease. I p"
2926,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"I was glad to reread this book for the first time in more than 20 years. It's a lot of fun -- fast moving, sardonic, and intelligent. It has some of the flavor of urban fantasy while set in a secondary world, and it also reminded me strongly of the recent debut Among Thieves , by Doug Hulick. There's lots of casual violence and morally questionable behavior here, but we are still left with the impression of strong codes of honor being adhered to. As for the prose, Brust does a great job of buildin"
2927,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"This is a fantasy book, yes, with all the kingdoms, intrigue, magic, and invincible swords one expects from a fantasy. What makes Jhereg more than typical fantasy, however, is Vlad, the first-person narrator, who reads like an escapee from a contemporary mystery novel who just happens to be living in a world where humans are an inconsequential minority. Vlad's got a modern sensibility -- hey, he's just a guy trying to make his way in a world -- that makes this such an incredibly entertaining rea"

2929,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"This is the first in the long-running VLAD TALTOS series. It's an interesting mix of politics, crime, and fantasy, all mixed in a blender and topped with a healthy dose of sarcasm. Vlad Taltos lives in a society where humans are basically second-class citizens. That's okay, though, because he's an assassin, and things are going pretty well for him, especially when he gets a high-paying contract to take out a politician who embezzled a substantial sum from political group. (I'm being very vague he"
2930,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,"I did like the book and the story, but it wasn't very 'fantasyish' in my opinion and as such, I didn't like it as much as I could have. There was no world building, aside from a few snips here and there, which is fine, if you aren't looking for that kind of book. Personally, for how short the book is, I found all of the houses / clans to be cumbersome and un-necessary. Aside from a few references here and there, it just seemed to be clunky. I realize that there is a whole series here, and I'll p"
2931,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,Obviously this is a classic fantasy novel and the series has been around forever but for some reason I never got around to it. I knew the main character was an assassin so I thought this was going to be really dark. It wasn't at all. It was just kind of normal with a faint sprinkle of kinda lame humor. I almost stopped reading it about 50 pages in but then the plot got interesting and kept getting more interesting. It was a short book so I stuck it out and actually enjoyed it. There seems to be
2932,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"Jhereg (and really all of Brust's work) was recommended to me by the book What Makes This Book So Great . I finally got a hold of a copy of Jhereg a couple of weeks ago, and was finally able to read it after New Year's. I enjoyed Jhereg . It was interesting, exciting, and set in a fascinating world. I liked the characters, all of which had depth and breadth. I especially liked that the women characters were strong but varied, so that they weren't stereotyped or carbon copies. The only problem I had"
2933,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2,"Steven Brust is another one of those authors that I somehow managed to miss when I was younger, even though he has quite a few novels to his credit and a sizable fan following. I was wanting something light and adventurous, having gotten bogged down in the middle of Lawrence Durrell's Clea . Jhereg was what I expected. A clean, no-frills adventure of an assassin who might have taken a job that was too much for him. I sit thinking about that last line and the possibility that I may have offended th"
2934,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,"Vlad has been paid heavily in advance by very violent, powerful men to perform an assassination. Failure is not an option, and success becomes more impossible at every turn. Author Steven Brust sets this action thriller in a fantasy world that is rich and fleshed out. For instance, race relations are ugly between the Easterners, who are built like us, and the seven + foot tall Dragaerans who live for centuries. Each race calls themselves ""human."" Vlad has a telepathic link with an intelligent win"
2935,Jhereg,Steven Brust,1,"Not good, not good at all! This is a good example of the one eyed guy being king in land of the blind. I hate books where the main characters (in this case Vlad) appear intelligent ONLY cause everyone else is an idiot. There's attempt to manufacture suspense but the David-Goliath complex crap is not appealing and requires too much suspension of intellect. The whole premise is that a guy on the all powerful council carries out a huge heist and some little shit head gets him presumably because cou"
2936,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"I fell in love with Steven Brust's world. I love how the humans are second class citizens which is a turn about in fantasy, sci-fi, etc. Who can't love a thief/witch with a pet dragon-like reptile that calls him ""Boss"" telepathically but with much sarcasm? The characters are more than a bit interesting in these books. Another interesting thing is how easily Brust changes ""styles"" of writing. The Vlad Taltos series tends to border on modern language and culture while the books in the Phoenix Guar"

2938,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,"I loved this book when I read it nearly 30 years ago, and was thrilled to get back to it on audio. I had some initial concerns about the narration, because the first-person narrator came across as relatively flat, but the addition of more characters makes it clear that the wry, flat, smartass note to the POV character's voice is intentional, and it's eminently suitable to the character. The narrator does a stellar job with this cast of characters, differentiating several female characters, numer"
2939,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,"One of my favorite series that I periodically re-read. Vlad Taltos - ""human,"" Easterner, Jhereg, crime-boss, witch, assassin is introduced along with his familiar Loiosh, wife Cawti, Dragaeran friends Sethra Lavode, Morrolan, Aliera, Krager, and others. In this book someone has ripped off the Jhereg Council and he's hired to take care of the problem. We're introduced into a complicated long-con by the guy who did it, and an equally convoluted solution to the problem of how to destroy him before a"
2940,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,"This book reminds me of Jim Butcher's Harry Dresden in terms of tone, wit, plot style, combat and character interactions. If you like Jim's work but want to read some High Fantasy instead of Urban Fantasy, try this on for size.  This book is fun. With fun characters, an enthralling setting and a gripping plot, Jhereg is great. The book throws you in deep from page 1. Similar to the Malazan series for a lack of a 'tutorial' beginning, throwing all sorts of worldbuilding at you without mercy for yo"
2941,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,"I needed something that would qualify as a pocket book for various trips around town so this one came off the shelf. It's just as relentlessly engaging as the first time I read it, and the second time for that matter. It's a bit rough around the edges compared to Brust's later work, but the skill wit which he lays out the world that he has spent the last 3 decades playing around in (and viewing the background events discuss in this book from very different angles) is impressive. I should give th"
2942,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,Interesting as a first book as it provides backstory for history that makes this seem more like a second or third book. Has a fast pace and reasonably interesting socio/political world. The short length makes you quickly move to the next book to find out more.
2943,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,"This felt more like a short story aimed to get the prospective readers anchored to the universe and its characters. Everything was just a bit too... shallow for my taste - things weren't epic enough yet. And I am stressing the 'yet' in that sentence because I strongly believe that the story will get more in-depth as it builds on. Ergo, I am still going to read the rest of the series; for Vlad is great. Also, it is an easy, relaxing read. Narrator is not volatile nor undependable -- possessing of"
2944,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,"The first book in Steven Brust's very popular line of Vlad Taltos novels, Jhereg introduces a very rich and compelling fantasy universe with sci-fi undertones that successfully combines classic fantasy elements with modern sensibilities. Vlad is an assassin for what is essentially the ""mafia"" of his world, and the mafioso elements combine quite well with all the tools that fantasy worlds have to offer. (An assassin that must deal with targets who can teleport, for example.) As with most of Brust's"
2945,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2,"I feel like I should like this book. I even didn't object to a lot of it in theory. But at the end of the day, every line came across as almost Scalzi-level arrogance masquerading as wit, and almost nothing happened. There were, I think, three scenes in the whole book where something happened besides people talking. The familiar was basically a Disney talking animal sidekick and was even less funny than everything else in the book. Now that I'm finished, I don't know what I was supposed to gain"
2946,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,"Righto, so I started with the “first” book of the series (at least, the first book that the publisher thinks comes first, not the one that chronologically comes first). I enjoyed it. It’s a fun, light read, with little seriousness, a bit of campy here and there, fun, roller-coaster type plot, and entertaining, interesting characters that I cared about. Vlad is a fun narrator and keeps the pace of the book very fast and the tone very modern. Things move briskly from page one and don’t stop until t"
2947,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,"This is an amazing book: a window into a world ruled by elves, where humans are a marginalized minority. It's a magic-system story and an elven-culture story and the story of one of the greatest heists the world has seen. This book is so amazing that it spawned about twelve direct or indirect sequels, most of which are based on parts of Vlad Taltos's life that are... actually kind of boring. But they all share the Vlad style, and they all have Steven Brust's excellent narrative, and that makes ma"
2948,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"4.0 stars. Piers Anthony is a MIND-NUMBING ENIGMA to me. He is capable of writing extremely thought-provoking, imaginative stories that are both original and speak to fundamental aspects of the human condition. The mystery is that he does so infrequently, despite being one of the most prolific authors in the speculative fiction. Wait....on second thought, maybe that is the answer. Quantity of production slamming right into the proverbial nuts of quality. Well this first novel in the Incarnation"
2949,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,"This was the first book I ever read of Piers Anthony and I was hooked. Original, imaginative and told by a true story-teller, this was a gem. And best of all, this blended good science fiction with pure fantasy elements to make a very enjoyable read. A man accidentally kills Death, an incarnation of Immortality and - shades of Tim Allen in The Santa Clause - he must don the black mantle and ride the white horse. It turns out to be a white car and a pretty cool gig when all is settled. That is un"
2950,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"This is the first in the Incarnations of Immortality series, and probably the best of the batch. I believe I read somewhere that Anthony originally intended only to write the five (Death, Time, Fate, War, and Earth), and I think he probably should have stopped there, because while With a Tangled Skein is probably the best book of the series in terms of pulling the other books together, they did (as Sci-Fi series so often do) start to drag quite a bit towards the later books, and ended up just pl"
2951,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,1,"Ok, I think it's time to delve into my long-evolving and conflicted feelings about this series and about Piers Anthony. Especially since I changed my rating for this book from a 5 to a 1. When I was young, I loved this series. It was on my favourites list throughout high-school. I was also pretty obsessed with the Xanth series, and would get new books from that series for many christmases and birthdays. These series, and Piers in general, go into my adult category of things-I-can't-believe-I-didn"
2952,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,"ORIGINALLY POSTED AT Fantasy Literature . When the grim reaper shows up a few seconds early, Zane shoots him instead of using the gun on himself as he’d planned. Now, instead of being dead, Zane is Death. He has to take over the office, riding around the world in his convertible pale horse collecting and measuring the souls of those who’ve committed equal amounts of good and evil during their lives — those who are “in balance.” In his new guise (complete with all of the accoutrements: scythe, hood"
2953,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"This was the book that got me into reading fiction many years ago, and inspired me to want to write. The reading happened straight away and I've not stopped since; the writing took a little longer to get started, and I see no sign of stopping that now either. So, reading for the second time many years later, much of the narrative feels a little dated in regard to social references and attitudes, but I enjoyed the story just as much as I did as a young man. Now I feel compelled to reread the rest"
2954,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,"Maybe a better title for this book would be, ""Euthanasia Rocks!"" I honestly thought I would like this book a whole lot more. It doesn't help that the impetus for my reading this book was a good friend's rusty memory of reading this in high school. I feel that would have been a great time to read it, now ... less so. My main problem was the annoying protagonist. I don't know if this was something that was a rule for fantasy writing in the 80s, but what is with the protagonist who's characterized as"
2955,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,"Actual rating: 2.5 stars. I can see where I would have been really into this series if I’d read it as a teenager. I was just busy reading at that point in my life and not very much into evaluating what I was taking in. It is a very male-oriented story, with women being mostly objects that they compete for and fight over. The male characters evaluate women by their age and attractiveness, although Zane/Death comes to grudgingly admire Luna’s strength, intelligence, and morality. If I had children,"
2956,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,"Reread this for the first time in 30 years. Enjoyed it, but not as much as books by Atwood or Gaiman"
2957,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"Death does ride a Pale Horse but that Horse can be so much more if that is what the job calls for, or at least that is what Anthony will have us believe. A friend of mine in high school pushed this series on me and I reluctantly started to read it. Have I mentioned that science fiction really isn't my favorite yet? Because yeah, it takes something special for me to really delve into science fiction. Not that this is science fiction per say but more like an alternate Earth with some futuristic ele"
2958,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"On a Pale Horse is the best book Piers Anthony's ever written. Sadly, that's not saying much. Anthony has some very creative ideas, but his prose is mechanical at best and plainly clunky at worst. Even so, some of the ideas are worth the slog. The Incarnations of Immortality series, though it fades at the end as all of Anthony's series do, is a clever and occasionally inspired look at religion, spirituality, and morality. In different hands it might have been pure art (see also, Good Omens by Prat"
2959,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"Piers Anthony is an author who is more conceptually innovative than literary. His writing is like puff pastry and not very substantive, but his characters are likable and the plots engaging. He has moments of preachiness mixed in, and sometimes a puerile sense of humor, but if you don't mind these things (or indeed, revel in them) you should give him a try. None of Anthony's books takes long to read, and you'll be able to tell by the first 100 pages of a series whether you're into his concept. Th"
2960,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,I think this is a case of it's not you it's me. This is a very popular book but everyone that I personally know that has read and loved it say they read it way back in the 80's or 90's. I wonder if they would still feel the same way if they read it for the first time today. I've just read too many outstanding fantasy novels this year so this book had big shoes to fill. Unfortunately it fell short. I'm not sure why but I went into this book expecting it to be funny. I was actually looking forward
2961,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,1,"Okay, I'm done. I made it 2 hours and 47 minutes into the audiobook, and this just isn't good. It starts with one of the most most blatant cases of the trope 'women as rewards' I've seen in popular fiction and just keeps piling them on. It's gross. I stopped just after the female football team with the invisible protective gear and mammary glands likened to those of goats. How that's sexy, I'm not sure, but Piers Anthony didn't spare the adjectives. He took several passes after the 'goat udder'"
2962,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,1,I first read this book back when I was 13 and loved it. Immediately tore through the rest of the books in the series and would regularly bring up the series in conversations about books worth reading. A few months back I found a paperback copy of On A Pale Horse at a book sale for 50 cents and picked it up thinking it'd be fun to revisit the series. Well... This is an extraordinarily sexist book. Alarmingly so. Women are regularly--approximately every time they are talked about--described by thei
2963,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,"It’s my first time reading Anthony, and overall I enjoyed this story. Yes, it’s dated, & yep definitely some unnecessary female sexualization, but overall I liked the story and it was a fun read juxtaposed with my current political read. I liked the play of good verses evil and all the grey areas, the exploration of original sin, and what if bad things are done for good reasons. It was a bit too simple in some places, but overall interesting read."
2964,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,"I’ve long been a fan of anthropomorphized versions of Death. This is probably not surprising, since we have been doing this for thousands of years to varying degrees of sophistication. And some do it better than others. I’m a big fan of Julian Richings’ portrayal of Death on Supernatural . He captures the eerie, inhuman quality of Death as a force of nature older than God so well, managing to appear suave and completely cold at the same time. (Plus, he kind of looks the part.) In On a Pale Horse ,"
2965,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"One summer while in Jr High, my brother handed me a book. The cover was yellow and depicted Death driving a very nice looking sports car. I loved the book, and unlike Anthony's Xanth series, Incarnations is still very readable for me today. I've heard the argument that many feel that Anthony has far too many sexual scenes in the Incarnations books. I guess I never really latched onto those scenes as being particularly offensive. There are worse books than these out there for that. The books thems"
2966,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,"Well, I enjoyed the author's note. That was entertaining. I read he does that at the end of all of his books. As for the book, itself, I'm not too sure. What I liked: The idea of the story - Death as a real man, unwittingly thrust into the role, and having to figure it out as he went. I liked Mortis the horse/limousine. I liked Satan advertising on billboards that Hell is actually a Fun place to be! I was a big fan of Dead Like Me and was so bummed when they canceled that series. There were actua"
2967,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,"The gospel according to Piers Anthony is mismanaged and a little boring. We're compelled to wade through half a novel of false doctrine before hitting actual storyline. Every chapter plants a seed of what's to come, but it is slow and tedious until the last few chapters. Had I read only the second half of the novel, I think I might have enjoyed it. It is a wildly creative story, embedding future, fantasy, and religion. Piers Anthony is thoroughly self-absorbed. This novel embodies his great love"
2968,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"This is the only Piers Anthony book I really liked. For once there's enough actual plot to distract the author from his usual preoccupations of breasts and bad puns. The premise is similar to ""The Santa Clause"", but instead of the jolly old elf, it's the Grim Reaper who kicks the bucket. Erm, gets shot to death by the protagonist. It's an ACCIDENT, okay! Now the protagonist has to take his place, and figure out all the gadgets Death uses to find the souls he collects. There's a cool car/horse, an"
2969,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"I decided to reread this series when I learned there was an eighth book. I could probably go straight to the eighth book no problem, but I remembered liking this series and I still do. The concept is very clever -- that each of the incarnations is a regular person fulfilling a job. Death becomes Death by killing the former Death. Afterward, he has to learn the ins and outs of his job -- making sure the souls that are roughly in balance end up going to the right place (haven or hell). And Satan,"
2970,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"This was the beginning of my Piers Anthony kick a couple years ago. This series was very interesting. It is called the Incarnations of Immortality, with this first book being the best of the series. The others were interesting. The premise is that regular people take on the mantle of Death, The Fates, Mother Nature, Mars, Father Time, etc. There are a total of seven books, so you can guess who the 6th and 7th are. I never could get ahold of the 6th book and I'm not one to skip on to the last wit"
2971,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"I very much enjoyed this fantasy book that focused on the office of Death and it's coorelation with the other Incarnations. It's cause and effect logic was always sound and infuriatingly obvious after reading the explanation of the logic. The author did a great job keeping the reader's emotions on par with the protagonist (Zane), even feeling the frustration and eventual enlightenment that he experienced. One more note: Mortis is awesome !"
2972,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,"In my opinion this is the best of the incarnations series. Interesting where the guy discovers he's ""become"" the new incarnation of Death (and of course how he became ""Death""). I think this was a pretty good book and it's one of only a few Anthony books I really like. I read a few others of the Incarnation Series, and incidental other Anthony books. Not in general a fan of his."
2973,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,"I first read this series in high school. I loved it! Sometime toward the end of my college career, I bought the series and began reading it again. I loved it a little less. Let's start with the major problem I have with this series. Piers Anthony writes almost every single female character as some crazy or weak person that needs a man to come save the day. How insulting! As if women can't be just as tough, reasonable or resilient as men? I don't know how I missed it the first go round - maybe I f"
2974,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"From memory-read this as a young man and liked it enough to read the entire series. A mortal takes over as the (nearly) immortal death, very entertaining."

The job comes with any number a perks - a shapechanging Deathhorse, a manor in purgatory, and who knows what powers - Zane needs to figure that out as he goes along, collecting the sould of those whose lives are in balance, neither good nor evil, to be sorted out and sent to hell, heaven, o"
2976,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"In retrospect this book reminds me a little bit of Terry Pratchett's Mort , though On a Pale Horse predates it. The idea of Death as an office rather than an entity was very original at the time and the adventures of the protagonist in this book as a rookie Grim Peaper is a lot of fun. The main difference between this book and Mort is the tone, the emphasis of this book is on action and adventuires rather than comedy. This is the first of Piers Anthony's Incarnations of Immortality series and is"
2977,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,"This book did not age well. I realize that this book is a product of its time but boy howdy, the sexism in this book is really bad. I tried to read it ""Mad Men"" style, trying to look past it but because the book hinges on this I found it impossible. I have read a lot of books from this time period, Stranger in a Strange Land is one I still enjoy despite it's sexism, this book just can't escape it. I picked up this book after hearing the TAL story about Piers Anthony. I realized I had not read any"
2978,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,It is the outstanding first book in the Incarnations of Immortality series recommended to me by my father who read it when he was my age. The series questions the nature of life by having mortals take on immortal offices which they can execute in whichever way they so choose... for the most part anyway. This book in particular follows the story of Zane and then Luna. His soul is fairly balanced between good and evil... or at least enough so that he has to be attended to by Death himself when he tr
2979,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"Besides the fact that Piers Anthony is still -oh-so-sexist- (though not as bad as in the Xanth series), and the fact that he can't write female characters to save his life, I still do enjoy this book. Others have said that this one is the best of the series, and I think I agree, though I also really enjoyed #6 (though most say the last two books suck). I definitely enjoyed the re-read and I am definitely looking forward to reading the next one, but I'm going to try to take a break from Anthony f"
2980,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"This was a neat new take for a fantasy subject & blended some light SF as well. I really enjoyed it, although the series got a bit redundant for me after several books. I did finish & keep the series. I reread it a year or two ago & would recommend it."
2981,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"Possible the best book that I have read. This is a straight-faced comedy about a man who, by accident, kills death. I think that I read it all in one day. Great story."
2982,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,A great exploration of death by an author who makes it fun and poignant.
2983,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"If the forces of nature were real persons... In the eigh-book fantasy series “the Incarnations of Immortality”, Piers Anthony brings us to a fantasy world ruled by magic and advanced technology where the forces of nature are incarnated by human beings who are temporary selected to preserve the equilibrium of the world. In this first part of the series, we focus on the story of the young Zane, who is assigned to carry out the office of Death. Throughout the first part of the book, we follow him whi"
2984,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,1,"While Piers Anthony’s ""On a Pale Horse"", the first book in his Incarnations of Immortality series, has an interesting central premise, this is completely overwhelmed by the fact it is juvenile, sexist, lazy and (the highest crime of all) not very well written. I had read and loved these books when I was a young teenager—the principal audience for Anthony’s work, I imagine—and was far more forgiving and less discerning in my tastes in general in those days. Now, revisiting the series decades later"
2985,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"Piers Anthony's On a Pale Horse is compelling and intelligent. The novel tells the story of Zane, the new Incarnation of Death in the immediate aftermath of his taking of the office. This book performs on multiple levels simultaneously. On the first it is an active and adventuresome fantasy novel, full of magic and cryptic characters, emotionally charged moments and plots, all the trappings of a good tale, no more and no less. On the second, it opens into a broad and interesting tale of the conf"
2986,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"I first read this series when I was in college (the first time), so that would have been in the early 90's say around 93-97, or so, and I absorbed this series reading all 5 books our library had. I remember the series seemed to be of less quality as I went along, but I must have enjoyed them because I read all the books I had access to at the time. Someone recently suggested I read them, and to be perfectly frank I had forgotten I had already read the series until this person brought up the name"
2987,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,"I have mixed thoughts about this book. Anthony's writing at times is amusing, but is equally often stilted and forced. In the Author's note at the end, Anthony acknowledges that he wrote the book not only to be entertaining as fantasy, but as a satiric commentary on the ills or evils of society. The world that Anthony constructs in this book is amusing and creative - it's in the details (the situations, characters, and dialogue) where Anthony doesn't live up to the potential of the world. I don'"
2988,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"This is a reread. The first time I read this was when it was first released in the 1980s. When Zane becomes suicidal, he tries take his own life. Due to a twist of fate (Literally!!) he manages to kill the Grim Reaper! And when you kill the reaper, you become the next reaper. This urban fantasy is both gently satiric and slightly noir in tone. Zane learns how to do his job, being Thanatos, the literal personification of Death. It turns out to be an interesting job. He learns how to take souls an"
2990,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"So, my uncle gave me this and the rest of the series of books when I was younger. I devoured this book. I had never really been into any sort of sci-fi/fantasy genre before, at least not something like this book. The concept of having death be a person and the ability to accidentally kill death and you become him just blew my mind when I was younger. I love this book, it's funny, it keeps you intrigued, it expands the universe in which it is set by having you see (view spoiler) [purgatory (hide s"
2991,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,"This was quite good. How could you go wrong with a story about a hapless schmuck who kills Death and therefore must take over his job? It's a quick read, with some truely sentimental moments, a few funny ones, and several interesting ideas on the whole life/death thing. This is the first novel in the Incarnations series, but this is the only one I was really interested in, so it stops for me here. A recommended fun read."
2992,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"Another example of how Piers Anthony can start a series with interesting concepts and characters and run it into the ground. I really liked the first couple of books of the Incarnations of Immortality series, but they quickly became repetitive and tiresome, especially as Anthony increasingly made authorial speeches through the characters."
2993,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"This is actually my second read through. It has been many years. And once again I am not disappointed. Anthony’s personification of Death is amazing, witty and thought provoking. Between humor and a well thought out story, you grow to become Death’s fan and even have a better understanding of his necessity. I now own all seven books and cannot wait to see what’s next."
2994,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"IMO, This was the best of the series by far. Often have the desire to re read this."
2995,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,"This was my first jump into Piers Anthony upon recommendation and I’m actually super surprised I hadn’t read him before. His work in both science and fantasy fiction should be right up my alley for the type of books I consumed rapidly in my younger years. For the most part, that’s how I felt about this book too: that I would have liked it a lot more if I had read it in High School. I’m not sure that’s a statement about the book so much as it is about me. I used to read with more speed and less c"
2996,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,"I remember this book as being really entertaining and thought-provoking (as a teenager). As an adult it was okay, and very nostalgic to read, but the way he writes is so odd and stuff and formal-ish, if that makes sense - it’s hard to get swept up by the story. There are also some troublingly racist and sexist scenes and some just general squickiness (a lot of weird children of rape stuff). There is still some things to think about and it’s a very imaginative story, and I really liked that the a"
2997,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"This was a spur of the moment re-read of a book that I dearly loved when it came out. In point of fact, I really loved the series in general, though some were stronger than others. This being the first, I think of the original 5 it was among the best. So...why only 4 stars out of 5? My age and outlook have changed. More and more I've come to the opinion that, while I enjoy Mr. Anthony's plots, I don't much like the man who writes these books. While I clearly didn't notice the underlying note of se"
2998,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"I think many, if not most, readers have that one author who they really, really enjoy reading, or enjoyed reading at one time, but looking at him objectively, realize that he's a very problematic author. For me, that author is Piers Anthony. He can be an incredibly imaginative writer when he wants to be. Some of the worlds he’s created and some of the ideas he’s written about in his novels are just brilliant. He can also write the most meandering, dull, preachy, and nonsensical stories ever put"
2999,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,One of the regular patrons at my job recommended this book and I am thankful that he did. I really enjoyed this book and would not have picked it to read without the recommendation. This book was very different than the books I normally read and I found it to be extremely enjoyable.
3000,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"A wonderfully intriguing tale of Death aka The Grim Reaper personified. I really enjoy Piers Anthony's gift at storytelling and creating well-rounded characters, the kind of characters you want to get to know. There was a bit too much of Christian sounding ideology, God and the Devil stuff, but still, this was definitely an interesting take on Death as a man with a conscience. Death as a helper and a guide."
3001,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,"I picked up this audiobook on CDs for a recent trip I was taking, without knowing the author, or realizing that it was originally published in 1983. Though I'm a fan of the SciFi and Fantasy genres, and I appreciate the overlay religious philosophy, overall the work felt simplistic in its morality tale and often offensive in its depiction of women. Often I find SciFi/Alt-Future fiction from decades ago can betray their age through references to technology that date the work by noting a lack of a"
3002,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,"Death faces a moral dilemma 10 January 2012 I guess once again my list is going to be over balanced with all of the Piers Anthony books that I have read. To be honest, on top of these, there are two more series (Apprentice Adept and Bio of a Space Tyrant) that I have also read, and that is not counting the twelve odd books that I read from the Xanth series. One may wonder why I read so many Piers Anthony books, and why I am actually admitting that I did. Well, first of all, most of the books that"
3003,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,"This book was, if I remember correctly, the first book by Piers Anthony I ever read. During the early years of High School, I devoured dozens more, sometimes two or more in a week, but I seem to remember taking my time with this one and re-reading it at least once before moving on to anything else. It impressed me deeply at the time, and I was sorry that the next books in the series hadn’t come out yet. I remember being disappointed by them when they did, because to my mind they didn’t stand up"
3004,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,"When Zane hits an all-time low in his life, he decided to end it. When Death walked through his apartment door, the sight of him startles Zane and he shoots death instead. The second death’s body hits the floor, Fate walks in, informing Zane of his new occupation, Death. The man who murders Death, becomes him. Zane finds himself suddenly claiming the souls of those who passed away with a nearly equal slate, to determine whether they go to heaven or hell. But when Zane questions the rules, things"
3005,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,"Conceptually, On a Pale Horse is an interesting novel. A man named Zane kills Death and takes the mantle of the grim reaper, forced to traverse the world and pass judgment on souls that are gray rather than black or white. What ensues is a long, drawn out, repetitive series of events that are meant to be intelligent reflections on morality and mortality but increasingly become boring, silly adventures in wheel spinning. Flipping through the book you get the impression that there's going to be a"
3006,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,"I hated this book virtually from page 1, as soon as I realized that the interesting basic idea of a human taking the office and job of Death is going to be ruined by juvenile writing style, and frequent but needless attempts of light humor, a la Terry Pratchett. At that point I was also paying big money for the smallest and worst pizza I ever ate in my entire life (courtesy of Pizza Hut), so that did not help matters either. A couple of weeks and 300 pages later, I can say that my initial dislike"
3007,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"I remember reading Piers Anthony as a kid. The book I had read was For Love of Evil, which I'd like to re-read at some point. But I had never read about his incarnation of Death. I am fascinated by points of view of normally feared characters, like Death, or the Devil. I think that there is always more than one side to a story, and I love exploring that. So On a Pale Horse was like catnip for cats, to me. I liked his very human characterization of Death. I liked that Death made mistakes, very funn"
3008,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"I've been wanting to read this book for a long time and I was very happy to find that it did not disappoint. Anthony uses a fascinating blend of science/technology and magic to create a unique world where flying carpets and winged horses are used for transportation along with cars and planes. The story follows a man who ends up taking the place of Death, one of several other incarnations or ""offices"" of the universe filled by those who were once mortal. I love the blend of fun storytelling with"
3009,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"This book is absolutely fantastic--I am curious if other writers using the same conceits have commented on this. I would consider it pretty much required reading for SciFi / Fantasy fans. This is one of those books where the idea is brilliant and he plays it out over and over and over again to the point where each repetition is breaking important new creative ground. Also, like other Genre books that create Genre's a lot of what he is doing here seems easy but is really amazing when you consider"
3010,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"I think that Piers Anthony's creativity is laudable. The book is about a man who becomes Death, and has to deal with his views on the one subject most would rather not think about. This book was actually a great concept, and obviously has meaningful implications in how death should be interpreted. It makes you think. The drawback to this: It also makes you think about how important serious revision, i.e. rewrites are. I found myself (as an aspiring writer) wanting to take some of his better scene"
3011,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,"Pros: Interesting characters and conflicts, with pacing and action you just can't put down. Death served as a solid everyman figure with underdog appeal and really served as a good introduction to the setting. The very ending (although not the circumstances that lead up to it) is quite good. Cons: The fantasy/tech mix is kind of lazy and the setting seems like window-dressing but with a weird moral outlook crammed in, it treats women like objects, the protagonist's internal monologue is often whi"
3012,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,"The first book of the Incarnations of Immortality series follows the life of Zane who, at the end of his rope, decides to commit suicide. In an act self-preservation he shoots Death who has come to reap his soul. After this Zane takes the mantle as the new death and must manage his difficult duties to ensure that the world continues in a moderately normal fashion.

3013,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"ON A PALE HORSE, the first book in the INCARNATIONS OF IMMORTALITY series, is a novel about a man named Zane, who finds himself taking over the job of Death after shooting the previous owner of that title. He must now collect souls and determine whether they should go to Heaven or Hell. Death, of course, comes on a pale horse, hence the title. Written by the well-known fantasy author Piers Anthony, the story takes place in current time, where one can travel by magic carpet or vehicle. Along his t"
3014,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"On a Pale Horse has a quick beginning. The reality of magic and science being equally forceful on Earth is established quickly, as is the plot. Zane is a loser who has wrecked his life to such an extent that he sees no other choice but to kill himself. Death came to collect him a little early and Zane ended up killing him, forcing Zane to replace him in the office of The Incarnation of Death. The tales of death, as seen through the perspective of Death are interesting, as is the Satanic plot tha"
3015,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,"If you had asked me 40 pages into the book I probably would have rated it 5 stars. 100 pages into the book it was about 4. 150 pages into the book it was 3...you get the picture here? I honestly can't say what exactly caused this book to deteriorate so much over the course of the plot. I think a lot of it had to do with the actual plot. The plot was extremely jumbled, as though the author had decided he needed every element—romance, humor, religion, sci-fi, science, and horror. Basically, imagin"
3016,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"""Death came with friendly care"" My God I love this book (pun intended)!!! This is the third time I have read this book. The first time, probably in the early 90s, was my first book of this genre. I was a very reluctant reader of fantasy but an ex-boyfriend told me I would love it. That was the only thing he got right! Haha! Trying to recollect, but the only other book I can come up with that I read three times is Pride and Prejudice. Well Mr. Anthony you are in very good company with Ms. Austen! Th"
3017,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"My first time reading this since I was 15, I think. Back in high school I was huuuugely into the Incarnations of Immortality series, (also the Xanth series) and apparently wasn't too concerned about the awkward writing and low-key misogyny found in most of Piers Anthony's books. These are glaring issues for me now, yet I still enjoyed the book - he has some great ideas about the nature of death (and Death) and was able to carry some of the scenes off really well. Of course there's the nostalgia"
3018,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"Death is personified. Screw-up makes good, uses power to stop suffering of dying. In teens, reader usually sees long life ahead, old age is a mystery. First fine impression held over 40 years, worth re-read. Surprisingly, series tangles by love, swamps in quasi-science and brain puzzlers, sinks on re-read. Long Author's Notes add insight, perspective. When Zane shoots Death, he has to take the job. Mortis, pale horse / limo, speeds over the world. He measures souls in exact balance of Good and E"
3019,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"As a writer wannabe, I thought the concept of this story was fascinating. Death comes to claim a suicide victim (Zane), but after many years in the position of Death becomes a little sloppy and allows the victim sees Death right before killing himself. Zane freaks out, and in a panic fires the gum at Death instead. Succeeding in killing him... Death! Now... Zane must pick up the reins and take over... Becoming Death himself! An intersting take, and very tongue and cheek as Zane learns the job and"
3020,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"THE book that seriously sparked my interest in reading!!! I was ditching a class in high school and decided to hide in the library which I knew no one would ever think of looking there for me. A good friend had been working in the library at the time and I asked him to ""throw"" me a book in case anyone actually saw me. 'On a Pale Horse' was handed to me and I decided to read the first part. I was totally absorbed into the book and went out that day to a bookstore and bought the first few books of"
3021,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"My ninth grade English teacher assigned this as extra credit. I had heard about this book a year earlier when I was sitting with a friend waiting for an ambulance to show up. I thought he'd addled his brains until freshman year. Zane has lost everything. Watching his future disappear in a world that equally embraces magic and modern technology, he finally decides that suicide is his only option. However, Zane didn't expect to have the Grim Reaper walk through the door. The surprise leads him to r"
3022,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"This could be a little twisty at times and you really need to get your head around the premise of the novel in order to enjoy it. I found the beginning a little hard to place as I wasn't sure if this was some sort of pseudo modern era or what type of genre it was aiming for, you're pretty much left to believe that magic is commonplace and that Satan advocates for souls freely, without much explanation as to why it is the case. Explanations come a'plenty later on so you just have to roll with it"
3023,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"Honestly, this wasn't what I was expecting. I'm a fan of the Xanth series, and I thought this would be a light-hearted adventure with some laughs. Of course, my own life grew grim just as I got into the book, as my mother unexpectedly passed away. (My own situation mirrored Zane's in a small way as my family had to make the decision to take my Mom off life support to end her needless suffering). I have to say that I found it very comforting to read about a compassionate Death during that difficu"
3024,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,1,"Do you like constant SAT vocab dropping? How about some super confusing story lines? Or maybe just too many themes in one place? Then this is the book for you! Blah. I just couldn't like it like I wanted to. I LOVE fantasy, but this was way too pretentious for a fantasy novel. His writing took away from the story. The premise was really interesting and I was excited to read it, but I knew from the first page that I would hate it. I will not be continuing the series. Or picking up another one of hi"
3025,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,"The writing is terrible and action scenes are as corny as they can get. But... I am giving an extra star for original concept (Death as an office assumed by a mortal) and unique world (blend of science fiction and fantasy), as well as another star for the first few gripping chapters. If the writing didn't go downhill from there, this book would be an instant favorite. Anthony introduced too many loopholes to make his character get out of unbelievable situations that after a while it began to loo"
3026,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,1,"Did you ever see the video of two chatbots talking to each other? The dialogue in this book was somehow less interesting and engaging than that video. The characters were flat and when talking were completely indistinguishable except when tagged with their name (""Zane said, ...""). The only way I could finish the book was to imagine that each character was a robot, trying to learn what it means to have emotions by studying people as they died."
3027,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"Oh, Piers Anthony... you're so insane. ""On A Pale Horse"" is an incredible novel, the 1st book in the ""Incarnations Of Immortality"" series. Some books are better than others, and it ended decades ago with ""And Eternity."" Unfortunately, Anthony decided to adapt some FanFic and release ""Under A Velvet Cloak,"" an 8th book about Nox. Let's NOT discuss how bad the first half of that novel was and concentrate on how awesome his original series was..."
3028,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,"I thought the premise for this story was promising and the modernization of an old story was a fun idea. That said, the promise was never quite fulfilled and the fun was never quite enough. When our sorta hero accidentally kills Death he has to take on the job and learn as he goes. He spends the vast majority of the book just being confused and trying to save his love interest. It just wasn't enough to stimulate the imagination or an interest in the rest of the series."
3029,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"WHY DID NO ONE TELL ME THAT FANTASY IS FULL OF POETRY?! Seriously. By the 33rd page I was hooked on allusions to Henley and Wordsworth, and midway through chapter 3 I found I loved Zane and his story as much as the prose and Anthony's poetic allusions. And what an author's note. Often, author's notes are not worth the cost of the pages they are printed on. Not so here. A very pleasant introduction to what I hope will become a very enjoyable series."
3030,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"This novel was first recommended to me 25 years ago and I have finally gotten around to read it. Amazingly this novel has stood the test of time marvelously. This book is as relevant today as it was 25 years ago. All about the character of Death himself, scicle and everything. This is a wonderful examination of death, life and love surprisingly. I enjoyed this novel tremendously and recommend it to all."
3031,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,"I read this the first time when I was a kid and really liked it then. I wasn't quite as taken with it this time but then it's not necessarily going to be better the second time around. It _is_ a good plot idea and it was a fun, quick read. I think Anthony has a little bit of the pervy teenage boy mentality when it comes to female characters - they are all either in the plot to be protected for to provide nurturing."
3032,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,"Read this as per a reading assignment. The teacher accused me of wanting to read this because of the groovy cover. I said, that's not the case at all! It was a nice cover. Something about a guy who is hired to become Death. Hijinks ensue. The only Piers Anthony book I've ever read. After that, it was enough."
3033,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"Pretty funny, engaging, fantasy/futuristic novel. I especially liked his author's notes at the end about how he struggled to get his more serious work out past tons of editors. Spoke to me as the husband of an aspiring author and seeing the amount of work one must go through to just get a book published."
3034,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"Listened to this story on audio book and well worth a listen, if simply for the great narration skills of George Guidall!! I’ve not read much along the fantasy genre, but did enjoy this story and look forward to listening to the remaining installations in Piers Anthony’s Incarnations series. There was love, hate, humor and a lot of fun--7 out of 10 for me."
3035,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"Better than mediocre, not Pulitzer quality. I love the idea of death, war, fate, time, and nature being jobs that mortal people do. Piers Anthony is clever and imaginative. This series is great, if you stop at the first five. Years after these, Mr. Anthony wrote two more about Good and Evil, and they were nowhere near as good as the first."
3036,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,Actual Rating 4.25 This was so crazy and cool and unique! I cannot wait to pick up the second book in this series. Incredibly clever and fun. The only reason this didn't get a higher rating from me is because I didn't really feel attached to any of the characters. The plot and world was fantastic but the characters were a tad bit lackluster.
3037,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"The idea of taking over the seat of death is one that has been parodied and expounded by authors as well as television writers. This particular scenario is well written, although the constant reminders of the main character's past or current feelings towards situations gets rather repetitive. Skimming over these paragraphs when they occur make a shorter but more interesting read."
3038,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,"I first read this book as a junior high student and loved it then. In the years that passed the book has become dated, its language stilted and some of its themes are sexist. The idea for the novel is still brilliant and I will try to re-read Bearing an Hourglass but sometimes the nostalgia of youth doesnt hold."
3039,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,"Fun idea. Would have lived to have read this as a teenager, I think, when all of us are feeling somewhat immortal. I actually read the book so I could get a look at the author's notes at the end. There was an episode of This American Life where a man had found Mr Anthony's house from various clues in the author's notes and traveled to see him--as a teenager."
3040,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,I got this book for free at the library . I recognized the author from a book I read 20 years ago or so I thought I would give this one a try . I really loved the sophistication/humor dichotomy in dealing with life and death .
3041,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"An alternate Earth where magic is commonplace. One drab member of the human race becomes the new incarnation of Death (by killing his predecessor, who had been clumsy); he is then thrown into the deep end to learn his new job."
3042,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,Zane (as Death) is a compassionate taker of souls. He battles with the help of the other Incarnations Satan for the soul of his love Luna. His decisions about his office are one of the coolest things about him. I wonder if the other books in the series are as good.
3043,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"Rereading because a new book was released for the series. It's been a while (years) but this is still one of my favorite series. Ambitious scope, new spin on an old character type, and accessible dialogue while still dealing with some profound concepts."
3044,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"Still as good as the two or more times I have read this book (whole series really) since high school :). Loki g forward to the next four in the series, and will probably ready the 6th and 7th despite my recollection of them being not as good as the main five books..."
3045,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"A captivating tale full of suspence, love, and hate and topped of with a twist. Piers Anthony puts in excellent charachters with completely different backgrounds and throws them together into an interesting combo. I highly recomend this book to a reader of fiction."
3046,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,1,"Sexist and annoying. I listened to this for a while, but mother of gods, no thank you. Maybe at another point in life, I'll like it. Or, someone who does like it, please explain to me what I'm missing. To simply listen without any added depth isn't worth my time. NEXT."
3047,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"Granted, I read this as a teenager but, it was the best of the ""Incarnations..."" series. The series was an interesting one but, the stories grew more tiresome as the series went forward."
3048,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,"The story was entertaining, but what I really enjoyed was the authors note at the end which describes how the author wrote and his experience getting published."
3049,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,Review to Come
3050,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,finally began the incarnations/immortality series. and it IS good. highly recommended.
3051,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,I'm kicking myself for waiting this long to read this.
3053,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,Revisiting books of 5teenway*. Style often cringey; engaging story. More entertaining than I thought it would be. Probably 3.5 stars... *sorry
3054,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,Still just as good as the first time I read it. I read it originally in my 20's and now in my 40's there are awesome nuance's that I missed the first time I read it.
3055,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,As good as I remembered from reading years ago.
3056,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,Entertaining read.
3057,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,"Silly, yet unique tale of a man falling into the role of death. Enjoyable although feels a bit too Young Adult."
3058,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,1,"This book was one element after another that I didn't like. When the dragons entered the story, it was just too much. Not finishing this one."
3059,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"If you are like me...unsure about the modern pantheon of death, god, satan...and the rest of the Incarnations...well this will sum it up for you! HA! its great!"
3060,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,A fantastic story of what happens to a feckless man who assumes the mantle of Death after he offs the Grim Reaper.
3061,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"Another excellent series by Piers Anthony, although I would rate this book as the standout element in the series. An imaginative force of nature."
3062,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"One of my all-time favourite books. I love this depiction of Death, a guy just doing his job."
3063,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"I LOVE this book, I have yet to finish the entire series but I have read this book over and over again many times over the years."
3064,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,one of my favorites..clever ideas throughout the series...
3065,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,1,Horribly written. I am severely disappointed with everything in this book. Given to another author this could have been good. Instead this is just insulting to anyone who reads it.
3066,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"This series overall is really good and this is one of my favorites, the second series of books I ever really read, Piers Anthony and the Xanth series were my first loves."
3067,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"A very good SiFi series. Nice quick reads and a very interesting storyline. Piers Anthony, for me is very hit or miss. This one was a great hit. Very recommended"
3068,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,Interesting book on the adventures of a man who has to take over deaths duties after he actually kills death.
3069,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"This book was not my favorite, but it was really good for what it was intended to be. It was really slow and tedious at times and I personally got sick of Death's CONSTANT inner monologue, but the ending made it all worth it. I would almost label this as a philosophical book over true scifi/fantasy, which, after reading the Author's note at the end, seems to kind of be what he was going for anyway. According to him, this book is meant to be a satiracle statement on society; something I think he"
3070,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"I forced my partner to read ""The Handmaid's Tale"" after I read it, so he forced me to read this book. At first I didn't want to like it because of this. It also is in a weird fantasy/sci-fi world that I personally have avoided for most of my life. That being said I did enjoy this book. I found it a weird mixture of soap opera elements swirled up in this story of a man forced into his position as the new death. It was interesting to see the differing personalities of each of the incarnations and"
3072,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,"It was ok. It had some little brilliant ideas nestled inside dull writing that kept me reading. There is absolutely no subtlety in the events, characters or realizations. You are beaten over the head with good versus evil, Satan vs God, and the nature of Death in such a way that leaves no complexity about them, which is perhaps the book's greatest fault. I did not like any of the characters except perhaps the horse, because he was a talking horse. All others are little cardboard cut-outs with li"
3073,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,1,"“My husband left me,” she said grimly. “After fifteen years-a younger woman-I’ll show him!” “Isn’t it a sin to commit suicide, according to your religion?” he asked. She paused, frowning. “I suppose it is, but-“ “And should you do such a thing to spite him? Why match the wrong he did you with a wrong done to yourself?” “I am a woman,” she said with a wry smile. “I owe more to emotion than to logic.” Zane returned her smile, showing that he appreciated her humor. No woman really thought herself illogi"

This was the fate of the low-life photographer named Zane, who had to assume the position of death after killing him. He has the support of four other incarnations (Fate, time, nature, war) who support him in his new role. They teach him what to do and how to complete the job of death. All seems to be going well until he receives one special client, the woman he loves. On A Pale Horse by Piers Anthony is the first book in the Incarnation o"
3075,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"My enjoyment of this book may have been nostalgia-based. The summer between 7th and 8th grade, we were given a list of books we could read, and the one we read would be the basis of the first assignment we had to do upon returning to school in September. Though it was clearly a way of pre-assigning homework for what was meant to be relaxing summer, I picked this book. Mostly because it had a cool grim reaper driving a car on the cover. And because it was about death, and I was a morbid young man"
3076,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,"The good: On a Pale Horse has a captivating premise: ordinary guy becomes Death incarnate, and hijinx ensue. The prose and dialogue are pretty good for mass-market science fiction. The bad: While the world Zane (aka Death) inhabits is interesting, the plot he's sent to execute isn't. A magician has big plans for Zane, as does Satan. Said plans seem to emerge out of nowhere about a third of the way through the story, once the workaday business of harvesting and classifying souls has run out of nar"
3077,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,1,"I've been meaning to read this book for about a decade. I finally plucked it off my bookcase and tried to get into it. I liked the concept. I even like some of the world it is set in. I didn't mind some of the description, but I just don't like Zane, at all. He's a bit of a male chauvinist, but you know what's worse than that? A boring male chauvinist. Seriously. The guy just took over Death's job and there shouldn't be a reason in the world for me to be bored, but I am. Perhaps this book is jus"
3078,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"The author overlays his simplified and somewhat convoluted understanding of Catholic doctrine with the personification of five esoteric offices, in a fusion of Greek mythology and Christianity set in a future time (although having been written in 1983, Anthony’s vision of the future was somewhat like watching the early Star Trek TV series where the future tools seem antiquated compared to contemporary technology) Never the less if you grant the author his world view the unfolding of the story all"
3079,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"This is my first Anthony novel and I have to say that it was interesting. I will likely read more of his novels to get a better sense of him as a writer. While I enjoyed this story overall, my only complaint is that the 60% of the story that makes up the middle of the story is very episodic as the protagonist just travels from one person to the next taking (or not taking) their soul. It's a bit like watching a TV show like Dead Like Me without the humor. For a while it feels a lot like ""Reap of t"
3080,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,"I would have liked this book a lot better if it had been a collection of short stories featuring Death being Death. I thought the writing was a bit pretentious and Anthony’s overuse of the words “proffer” and “bailiwick” made me want to bang my head against the wall. While I did enjoy the premise of the story, I sometimes couldn’t tell if Anthony was trying to be funny and ridiculous or keep his tone serious. I felt a little guilty snickering at times. I also found the main female to be unlikeab"
3081,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"This was an absolutely phenomenal book! The characters were all very easy to relate with, and the view of Death as well as the other Incarnations was very refreshing. Something that I found intriguing outside of the story was Piers Anthony's author's note in the back. I enjoyed listening to this with my 10 year old. He was very entranced by the story and the ideas surrounding it like Purgatory and different ideas of how Heaven and Hell would be. It's narrated by George Guidall, the same person w"
3082,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,"I picked this up as part of a buddy read. I was interested to read Piers Anthony, having heard his name a lot, and figured I’d fill this gap in my SF/F reading. I planned to read through at least the first few books in the series, but after this one, I think I’m done. (And now having read about skeeviness in some of his other writing... I have additional reservations keeping me from reading on.) Pros: great premise, fascinating ideas, some interesting exploration of those ideas, and a decent plot"
3083,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,"A good book, especially considering the time period in which it was written. Stylistically it doesn't hold up to the faster pace of today's sci-fi, but the book overall is an interesting concept and makes you think. Death (and the other typical incarnations--time, fates, etc) as a job. Regular people getting thrust into the roles. The ideas on life vs death and heaven vs. hell vs. purgatory. It's an interesting concept to think about anyway. I didn't really connect to the story or any of the chara"
3084,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,1,I felt like I was reading the results of a high school creative writing assignment. One in which the author plumbed the thesaurus regularly to add every obscure word possible in the hopes of adding some headiness to a hopeless novel. I was offended on numerous occasions at how poorly it was written and how stilted the interaction between characters. I only finished the book out of a sense of duty to the person that recommended the book. I couldn't even enjoy it on the level of satisfaction you g
3085,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"52 Book Challenge Week 25: On A Pale Horse chosen by Cassie This book claims to be a fantasy but really it's ethics and philosophy dressed in a fancy coat. Death has been killed and now his killer must take up the cloak and resume the office as an Incarnation. The learning curve is steep and the new Death seems to have a lot more internal conflicts than previous. Along the way, many facets of life, death, good and evil are discussed from all kinds of angles as he encounters interesting clients an"
3086,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"In 1988, I started keeping a reading list of the books I read. I would record the title,author, year published, type of book (such as fantasy, science fiction, fiction, or non-fiction), date finished and a rating of how much I liked the book. Now in 2017, I still record entries in this same exact journal as soon as I finish a book. My journal is one of those Marble Composition books that can be found in dollar stores these days. I would suggest that all readers keep a written list of all the boo"
3087,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,1,"OK, this is the second Piers Anthony books I've tried to read in the last month, and I think it will probably be the last. My question is: Who hurt you, Piers? There seems to be some latent trust issues with women at play behind the scenes in his books. Just a quick note in case anyone was still unclear, women aren't objects to be traded around like playing cards. Nor are they sex dispensers for whenever a character does a good deed. Good lord, between this book and A Spell for Chameleon I have"
3088,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"I had been picking up this book to read before I fell asleep, and it took me more time to complete since I fell asleep immediately most of the time. The plot of the story is interesting enough and kept me hooked, but his writing was a bit challenging. He throws in some vocabulary which is used in an English test, or so I felt like. The dialogues were sometimes very unnatural. I felt the author is a sexist.. although all these negative feelings, I have quite enjoyed this book. My bookish friend g"
3089,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,"My opinion for this book is very coloured by my experience reading Terry Pratchett's ""Mort"". This book had it's own take on Death, and it took an interesting turn. I found Terry Pratchett's writing to be more consistent. That is not to say that Piers Anthony's writing is bad, I just found myself skimming paragraphs because they were boring or between me and the 'interesting bits'. I found Anthony's world to be intriguing with both magic and science in existence, some cases fulfilling the same ro"
3090,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,"Perpetual loser in life Zane is about to commit suicide when Death comes for him--literally. Panicked, instead of turning his gun on himself, Zane shoots Death... and kills him. Now, by the rules that govern the Incarnations, Zane becomes Death. And the Afterlife will never be the same. I didn't care for this book much. I guess I was expecting something more along the lines of Anthony's Xanth novels, which are ridiculously silly and full of puns (though not without some depth to them as well). I"
3091,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,"LOVE the story. LIKE the writing. Piers Anthony is a weaver of story magic, but the text runs on a bit and I found myself tuning out during his extended expositions. Still, the story was enough to keep me going through the entire Incarnations of Immortality series. After reading it many years ago I decided to give it another chance and found that I had to listen to it on audiobook at 1.5 speed. The reader's voice is low enough that it doesn't sound like a chipmunk, but I could get through the ex"
3092,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,"Liked it, didn’t love it. The idea of a man killing death I like in the terms of a sci-fi fantasy but everything after I think Anthony lacks. It’s a simple love story with obstacles in the way. During the whole book death second guesses himself and questions his acts. I believe someone can argue for the other case that at the end he can finally make a decision but give me a break. The incarnations plotting, Satan throwing down his tricks. This book does not stick with you, you will not remember"
3093,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,I heard a great This American Life segment featuring Piers Anthony couple of years back so was curious about his books. On a Pale Horse was written in the early 1980's and now would be considered YA. It's somewhat juvenile but under the surface offers an interesting look at ageism and euthanasia. Anthony also ends many of his books with quirky Author's Notes that in and of itself are worth a read. If you're an adult and a fan of this genre or have a teenager who's looking for something different
3094,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,"The best I can come up with is, meh. On one hand, it was an extremely entertaining world build. On the other, I didn't really like Zane. Plus, the exceedingly sexist male-gaze every two or three pages made me shudder. Literally, every few pages there was a moment that shocked me completely out of the story. Moments where Fate calls herself lacking in sex appeal, where a professional sports figure gets magically stripped or when a girl is summoned to her father and shows up naked. In the end, it"
3095,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"Oh man, what cool take on a personalfied version of a supernatural being. I absolutely LOVED this book. It was believeable, believe it or not. When you take something as big as Death, and try to tie it to mortality, it doesn't fly too often. But here, it definitely did. Death was cool, and conflicted, and what a neat way to look at this super being. He's larger than life like Death should be, but not so much so, that the reader can't still relate to him. This might be one of those rare books I'l"
3096,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"I actually read this book in high school and was amazed by it because it was like a modern version of the ancient Greek myths with a simultaneous modern twist. It also posed some deep ethical questions about life, death, and the nature of good and evil. That's deep for a high school book! i saw it again just last week as a library discard and literally jumped at the chance to read it again. i red in about a week and loved every page (except the really corny lines like ""Death shall not be stayed..."
3097,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"An exploration of ethics through the role of Zane as he adjusts to his new role as Death, after accidentally murdering his predecessor. The idea that Death is a bureaucracy has been done to death but was probably really fresh when this book was first published. There are some cheesy lines and the plot line changes slightly to where Zane's romance becomes the most important element, which can get annoying at times. Also, can get sexist at times. Overall, an interesting fantasy, I look forward to"
3098,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,1,"This was recommended to me from a friend when he found out I like to read fantasy. I typically try to make it to page 150 or so before I make my mind up about a book. Only made it to about 75 I am not interested or invested at all. I would rather close my eyes and rest then open this book. To be fair it wasn't badly written I just don't think I like modern fantasy (or modern 80s fantacy...) It reminds me a lot of the Storm Front from Dresdin files. I didn't like that book either, but if you do y"
3099,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"What happens if it's your time, but you kill somehow kill Death instead of the other way around? In Piers Anthony's Incarnations of Immortality universe, the protagonist discovers that he must become the new Death. Anthony spins an easy to read, usually quick moving tale of the new Death's on the job training, assisted by Fate, Time, War, and Nature. Add to this the practices and policies of Purgatory, encounters with Molly Malone of fishmongering fame, and a scheme where everyone's soul (includ"
3100,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,"On the plus side, the plot shows the author's considerable imagination. On the minus side, the book seems to be aimed at adults, but is written intellectually at the middle school level (with a handful of SAT words thrown in for spice), and the intellectual return on investment is a huge disappointment. The book aspires to some philosophical / religious insights, but really, it's pretty thin gruel. The author's juvenile treatment of religion is typical of the casual atheist. I really wanted to l"
3101,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"AMAZING!!! Read this book, just read this book. This book is fantastic. It's up there among my top five currently and I cannot WAIT to read the rest of this series. The characters were good, plot was good, story telling was good and I was surprised more than once. Excellent writing and storytelling at it's finest. Also, I cried and laughed more than once as well :P Adding to my collection ASAP."
3102,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"The Matchsticks of Thought I have referenced this book on any number of occasions without realizing it. Anyone who reads this book will walk away with more than just an alternate way of looking at the universe; they will walk away with a more concrete idea on how to think. I return to this book (and, indeed, this entire series) every few years to remind myself of how important belief in one-self actually is. I highly recommend this book."
3103,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"Wanted to dip my feet into a bit of Sci-fi, so it goes. Piers Anthonys' writing style is not my favorite, but I was thoroughly impressed by the creativity surrounding the natural elements of life. The book is fast paced and banter straightforward as hell (no pun intended) - I skipped through most of the authors note in the back but ended up memorizing the last paragraph by rereading it so much - those last few sentences were impeccable and tied up the book beautifully."
3104,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,1,"I was tempted for a moment to give this another star, because the concept and the world-building were good. But at the end of it... no. This book was consistently sexist, and the writing was pretentious at best and clunky at worst. I have no problems with the story in and of itself, but every time I started to enjoy it I was angered by the way it was told. I see what the author was going for, and I like what it could have been an awful lot more than I like what it is."
3105,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"New obsession! A friend from work suggested this book vehemently to me (and we work at Walmart, how's that for some stereotype dispelling?) I finally gave in and downloaded it, to make my friend happy. Imagine my thrill at finding a new book series to obsess over and enjoy. This book is intelligent, funny, thought provoking and fun. 5 of 5 will recommend and strongly as my friend did"
3106,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"Even though they can stand alone, I wish I had read this one first. I really enjoy the concept and have fallen in love with the characters. If they did have human characteristics, I would like eternals to be wise and scrappy! I read Bearing an Hourglass first and the time travel required a little reorientation at one point, but still enjoyed the books. Reading Tangled Skein now, hope to finish the books in the series so far before summer ends."
3107,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"Piers Anthony tells a great tale of a world where Magic and Science intersects. This is the story of a regular guy that becomes an 'Officeholder' of one of the most powerful Incarnations. Death, War, Nature, Fate, Time. All of the characters play a role in society to keep the world running smoothly. Its a fascinating take on life. This book is great for teens or young adults and adults of all ages. A little hit at sex, but not out of control."
3108,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,"Some great ideas when exploring the particular incarnation of a natural 'force' (in this case, Death), let down by dated and sloppy writing the veers between shallow wish fulfilment and uncomfortable dated views/sexism (mild in the book by my standards, but apparently much worse in other works by the author)."
3109,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,"Enjoyable read. Fun take on the role of death. I kind of dislike the narrator (listened to the audiobook in my car) so that may have made it less enjoyable, but at the same time the narrator seemed to fit the protagonist as well. I don't know if I'll continue on in the series. Definitely not anytime soon."
3110,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"Zane, a guy of middling moral fortitude who's just been tricked into using magic to fritter away any chance of future happiness in his life attempts to shoot himself in the head, but when Death comes for him personally he freaks out and shoots Death right in the face, killing him! He becomes Death! Satan tries to mess up his job, but he perseveres and becomes a good Death!"
3111,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"The world and plot are well-fleshed out, with some really interesting social sparring between the immortal characters. I would have rated this higher, but my enjoyment was spoiled somewhat by the egregious and unnecessary focus on cringe-worthy male gaze sections. I can only hope that it doesn't come up in the second book."
3112,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,"This is one of the few series I own, and have owned since I first read it more than a decade ago. I decided to reread it, but I didn't love this first book as much as I remember. It still has an interesting plot and premise, but I didn't really like Zane. There was nothing specific in my dislike, I just generally didn't find him an interesting character that I wanted to root for."
3113,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,"Overall, I enjoyed it. Easy read, some interesting concepts and a nice blend of science fiction and fantasy. Yet, as a story went, I never really got past my initial dislike of Zane and felt he had very little agency in the tale. Even the resolution felt a little pat. Anthony's world view and sexism also seemed to distract me. It says something when your favorite character was a horse/car."
3114,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"I haven't read this genre in awhile, and started this one on my husband's recommendation. I really enjoyed the writing style; the descriptions provided great imagery and the dialogue presented heavy themes {life & death, love & loss} in an accessible way that encouraged further reflection. Great read to start off the new year."
3115,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,I kept avidly reading the book and as I got closer to the end I was thinking that there was no way it could have a denouement. Would it go into two books? Would I have to go searching for another one? Whew! Nope. It wraps up with a solid ending. A man who becomes death and must defend the woman he loves from Satan. Powerful stuff.
3116,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,Of this entire series this has always been my favorite book. There is just something about Zane and his story that really touched me. I know that many times the 1st of a series is the best but in this case each book represents a different person and therefore different experiences and duties. In this case though I would say that is not the case.
3117,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"The first time I'm reading this author, and surprise surprise - it was published in 1984. This is an outstanding story of Death, and the work that Death carries out. I was just fascinated by the imagination and language of the writer, and amazing dialogues on delicate but powerful issues that prevail even today. I thoroughly enjoyed the book. Wish a movie would be made of this one."
3118,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"""Fiction should always entertain! But on another level it is a satiric look at contemporary society, with some savagely pointed criticism. It is also a serious exploration of man's relation to death"" Piers Anthony from the Author's Note in On a Pale Horse. I loved this book completely and am excited to start book two. This book will definitely be a reread."
3119,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,1,"I remember enjoying this as a tween, but it didn't age well for me. It is immature, intentionally silly and very fixated on the female form. The mixture of comedy and existential ideas just didn't come off well for me."
3120,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,1,"It had some really interesting ideas at play, and I appreciate that he attempted to tackle some socio-political issues within the text but it just didn't work for me. The writing was okay but the characters were absolutely one-note. Full review to come"
3121,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,Enjoyed reading this as a kid... Probably around 14. Some themes were a little edgy. And some of the sexual components in this book were disturbingly weird. But the writing was decent and the story idea itself was very cool.
3122,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,1,"I think the target audience for this novel is a 14 year old boy. I found the plot to be inexplicable, illogical and corny. But what I found truly disgusting was the objectification of women from beginning to end."
3123,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,"Another one that I gave up on. I'm just having so much trouble staying invested in the story and the main character. The Audiobook reader also leaves much to be desired. Great concept, lackluster execution. Only read if a good concept alone can keep you enthralled."
3124,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"A very original story that gives you a glance into the profession of the, in this case, not so grim reaper. A story that I had to warm up to a bit but then took me away unexpectedly. The writer combined magic and technology in a way that works."
3125,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,I have always enjoyed Piers Anthony's books but I had never read this series. As a whole I quite enjoyed this series of books. I found the characters and story to be clever and interesting. It sort of reminded me of a more adult version of a Rick Riordan series of books.
3126,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,2.5/5 The main character Zane makes some really stupid decisions that ruin the plot near the end. The world building is pretty cool. I really enjoyed the blend of magic and science in normal everyday life.
3127,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,An interesting series The author treats with some serious issues in a jocular manner. This author is great at creating believable worlds. I sometimes run out of money by the fifth book. I don't consider puns to be all that humerous.
3128,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,A friend of mine told me to read this over 20 years ago. So it's been sitting on my to read list that long. Wish I had read it way back then. It's nice to know that Piers Anthony still holds up twenty odd years later.
3129,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"This was a very intersting sort of book, I really enjoyed it actually because Zane's struggle with his feelings and choices were very realistic and human, despite him being the Grim Reaper. Overall a very good book that I'll probably read again in the future."
3130,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"I found the main character, Zane, a bit too whiny at times. The hang ups he has seem to be totally outlandish. other than that, loved the book and have gone through 4 already. Also, my bf, who is more a scifi guy is love this and series as well."
3131,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,Such an unusual but funny and thought provoking book!
3132,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,1,DNF 1st chapter... Good writing/concept could not engage me enough to get past dated/sexist.
3133,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,I haven't read Piers Anthony in many years. This was a well thought out story. Enjoyable and thought provoking. Probably 3.5 stars if it would let me do a half a star.
3134,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,A good story about Death's life.
3135,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,Fantastic series -- the kind of books I immediately wish I had thought of first!
3136,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,Loved this series on its first release. Planning to reread.
3137,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,"This book was disappointing....great potential that doesn't deliver. While the book is partially about collecting souls, it lacks one itself. Cheesy."
3138,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,LOVED AS A PRETEEN. Looking forward to reading again.
3139,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,Just as good the 10th time as it was the first. Enjoyable series that I am highly looking forward to reading again.
3140,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,easy to put down but also easy to pick up...savvy??
3141,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,This book helped me through my grieving process better than any books I read that were actually meant for that purpose.
3142,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,This is my favorite fantasy series.
3143,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,"While I really enjoyed the creativity of this fantasy novel and felt they story was fun, the sexism is just downright comically bad. It's really hard to get past such a ridiculous view of women."
3145,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,"disappointing, repetitive. Meh."
3146,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,A well written book. Enjoyed reading it.
3147,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,I love this book! I am glad I have the entire series at my fingertips to read it again.
3148,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"Good fun, a great start to the series."
3149,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,"Back to the late 80s for this one, not a bad story line but haven't read for years."
3150,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,As fun and interesting as I remember it!
3151,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,A well written book. Enjoyed reading it.
3152,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,Really enjoyed this story looking forward to reading more in the series.

3154,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,"Rereading this series, as my lovely mother replaced my missing collection as a birthday gift. Wonderful framework, engaging characters, clever, and highly snackable."
3155,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,2,"I wanted so badly to like this book. It has so much going for it. It is original and inventive. I never once caught myself thinking, ""Now, where did I read that before? Oh, right, in the last three books!"" The idea of the graced, their skills and their mismatched eyes; of the seven kingdoms; of the characters themselves. All of them were uniquely Cashore's own. Her prose was clear and lucid, though there were passages that dragged and made me want to skip ahead. So, pacing was occasionally a pro"
3156,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,"Graceling by Kristin Cashore follows in a burgeoning market for strong female characters. Katsa is much like Katniss from The Hunger Games in her naive perception of the world, her coldness and tendency towards pragmatic practicality. She is similar to Xhex from the Black Dagger Brotherhood in her disgust of all things ""feminine"". The story is well written, with engaging, fun characters. Katsa is fun to read about. The plot may be a little predictable at times but it did throw me a curve ball tow"
3157,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,1,"Graceling has a beautiful cover, great premise, and lots of hype, and would be a terrific novel if it weren’t for the writing and atrocious main character. What is with the awkward sentence structures and prose in this book? ""In these dungeons the darkess was complete, but Katsa had a map in her mind."" It should be ""In these dungeons, the darkness was complete, but Katsa had a map in her mind."" And look at the next sentence: ""One that had so far proven to be correct, as Oll's maps tended to do."""
3158,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,"When a monster stopped behaving like a monster, did it stop being a monster? Did it become something else? Authors, take note: This is YA Lit done right. Katsa is a monster. She's been one ever since she discovered the power of her killing Grace. Only...she starts to wonder, does she have to be? In the Graceling Realm, those born with heterochromia (different colored eyes) are blessed with a Grace. A Grace can be anything from the mundane (i.e. holding your breath indefinitely) to the cruel (i."
3159,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,3,"First thing I need to point out is that I consider myself a feminist, even as far as to take an active role is such matters. Previously, I have written articles on Feministing and I honestly think so many of these issues are still very important in today's world. However you look at it, the battle for equality has not been won and has, in fact, become rather dormant. On that note, I love reading fiction by feminist writers, Atwood never fails to deliver and The Handmaid's Tale is one of my favou"

3161,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,2,"Updated 04/01/14: I happen to like books which feature kick-ass feminist heroines and are light on the romance so I should like this book, right? Yeah, but I don't. First of all, Katsa acts like a petulant little girl throughout the entire book, not some strong feminist poster woman. Katsa shows very little, if any, personal growth over the course of this novel. Also, I felt like the author spent too much time trying to sell us on the following ideas: femininity is an idea forced upon women by t"
3162,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,"it is so hard to write reviews for books i actually like. no, love . talking about this book is like trying to describe to someone a relationship from long ago that was bittersweet and is now over, but i have never had a relationship that involved so many horses and swordplay, not even metaphorically. and fewer people care about my love life than about this book. (i see you ariel - you are glowering at me with tiny slitted eyes) but this book is like a wonderfully sweet relationship. at the beginni"
3163,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,"Okay, so this was a re-read on audio and I thought it was really cool with the multiple narrators and music and stuff. But sometimes one of the voices rubbed me the wrong way and the music went from fantasy to what sounded like western music. Lol. Maybe it was just me! I still loved the book though =) I am in love with Katsa! She is an awesome inspiration for women warriors in a book. She kicks arse and takes names. I love the fact that she doesn't care anything about marriage or having kids. Sh"
3164,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,"When a monster stopped behaving like a monster, did it stop being a monster? Did it become something else? So fun fact, this is probably one of my most reread books of all time, and it was such a big influence on both what I write and what I love to read, and I love and appreciate it more every time. And I’d love if you all could appreciate it too along with me? This book opens with a scene in which Katsa, a character graced with the skill to kill people - literally, actually murder them - pu"
3165,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,"Update 1/24/2012. I probably should already stop being surprised by the fact that every time I reread a book, I come up with something new to say (or feel) about it. Looks like my previous reading of Graceling caused a lengthy rant. Yeah, no such strong feelings this time. This time, I was able to appreciate the writing more. It's lovely. I really love how it flows, how the sentences connect. This book stands the test of time. And it's great that it stirs so much discussion and, often, outrage."
3166,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,"4 Stars Overview: “When a monster stopped behaving like a monster, did it stop being a monster? Did it become something else?” I honestly didn’t know anything about this, but I'd seen it around and finally it was recommended enough. I was really surprised by the depth of this story and the characters. The story revolves around Katsa, who lives in a world where people can be born with a ‘Grace.’ Meaning, aside from two-different eye colors, they have an exceptional skill. Katsa’s grace is killin"
3167,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,"Loved it. Except for the raging feminist agenda. NOTE: Since these two brief, flippant sentences have gotten so many trolls over the years, I'll just add that I support the book's feminist ideals 100%. What I do not like is the way we're hammered over the head with the message. (The ""raging"" part, if you will.) It's inelegant, tiresome soapboxing that managed to annoy someone who actually agrees with the principles, so I don't know how it's going to persuade anyone who does not. Katsa's views als"

Soooo I thought this was some kind of Hunger Games-type dystopian story about a girl who could kill with her touch for some reason and put off reading it because I wasn't huge on Shatter Me. BUT then this turned out to be full of castles and princes and everything I love so that was a fun surprise! I'm extremely neutral about this book, though. There were a few elements I liked (mostly the castles and princes), but the worldbuilding was weak and the writing itself was really dull. I di"
3169,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,"Gah sooo good! Okay, I read some of the other reviews and now I feel the need to defend this book. Basically, I think it's completely hilarious how many people are shocked and appalled that 1) there is sex in this book, and 2) the heroine does not desire to get married or have children. Guess what? Young adults *do* have sex. And the idea that it's not love if you don't want to marry them, or that you shouldn't have sex until you're married is why all the poor children in your congregation are ma"
3170,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,3,"[This is a review of an advance copy.:] While Cashore shows herself to be a promising writer in many respects, this book could have used a better editing job, especially with the pacing, the climax and the dénouement. Other points: 1. The dialogue she put in the ten-year-old princess's mouth was not believable in the slightest; maybe Cashore should spend some time around pre-adolescent girls to get an idea of what they really talk like. 2. The psychology of several of the characters (including Kats"

But I fought my way through it because, goshdarnit, I picked it up at the library, dragged it home with a load of other books and groceries, and renewed it the max number of times - I was gonna finish it. You know the kickbutt heroine who is just totally kickbutt and doesn't need no one, no way, no how, and yet loves and feels and hurts deeply and yet keeps everyone away because she is b"

This started off really well and I was actually enjoying it, but around page 230 I started to drift away from the plot and (view spoiler) [Po's sudden love confession for Katsa (hide spoiler) ] really annoyed me because I did not like their romantic relationship.

BOOM #1: Katsa While I love the author's intent for empowerment with Katsa, she was a bit too much of a special snowflake for me. I will forever fist-pump to her unstoppable strength as a warrior, a woman and a person, but at the end of the day she was highly unrealistic and too much of a caricature for me. She's kind of a double edged-sword in terms of her feminist appeal, too. Instead of helping the women"

I have thought about this book a lot, and the fact that I really disagreed with the message about women, what empowers women, how they show that they are 'strong' and 'independent' women. I am going to downgrade my rating because I felt like the message in this book was too blatant and leading. It feels manipulative to me, and that's an issue I can't get past. Ultimately an author has a choice of"

But then it started reading like a feminist/anti-marriage/anti-kids campaign platform (okay - that might be a little much, but you started to feel that the author had an agenda). It was just really disappointing, because I loved the characters so much. Oh well. Also - even though it's considered a YA novel, there is sex in it. Pretty disappoint"

So this book is about a ""graced"" girl called Katsa. Being graced means you are born with a specific skill that you are great at. They are recognized by their eyes which are two different colours. Katsa is a graced killer (or so she thinks) and she meets a guy called 'Po' who is also graced. Together, they try to uncover the mystery behind the kidnap of Po's grandfather. I enjoyed the"

Katsa and Po were charming together- they were likeable protagonists and the resolution to the story was unconventional or at least not what I expected. I can't say too much without it being a spoiler, but I will say there was one event that I was glad did NOT happen when I thought it might. The Realm of the Gracelings was well portrayed. Well worth a read!"

3218,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,3,"“How absurd it was that in all seven kingdoms, the weakest and most vulnerable of people—girls, women—went unarmed and were taught nothing of fighting, while the strong were trained to the highest reaches of their skill.” I completely agree that girls should have been taught self-defense and self-sufficiency. This also applies to our society. Girls need to learn self-defense. First of all I think Po is kind of a silly name for a young, handsome, vigorous prince, who is pretty dreamy. Po's name"

Kasta is quite stubborn and self-centered, but I really appreciate she's not another brainless ripoff of most of the girl characters out there in romance/YA-novels. Kristin is an artist if we're talking about character dynamics, but sadly the plot lacks something to tie the ideas together and I can easily spot why some readers would find this kinda boring. Thanks to my friend Jess for the recommendation <3"

In this high fantasy world, Katsa is a fiery girl graced with the art of killing and used by her uncle king to do his dirty business, but on the side she's a vigilante saving the people her uncle and the neighboring kings harm. What a great idea for a main character. The imagination of Cashore to create this world and give Katsa her perfect match and her perfect deadly villain is impressive. I was"

First as Lady Danielle ""The Book Huntress"" noted she ""has an issue"" with this book, I had a couple. I don't know if one of them is her's but we'll talk about mine in a second. One of them I can discuss in my general review, the other I'll mention below a spoiler"

Together, they begin a journey to solve a mystery. Positive things : Well, I couldn't put it down: It's an amazing book and a compelling story. I enjoyed Katsa just as much as I enjoyed Po.

3232,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,3,"Three star books are often the most difficult to write reviews for because they're books that didn't completely work for me and yet I still enjoyed them overall. Graceling is one of those books. I'll start by saying that when it comes to high fantasy I tend to prefer political intrigue over adventure stories, and while Graceling is a mix of both it definitely leans more heavily on the latter. The long stretches of time spent traveling were a bit tedious for me. Those who love adventure fantasy s"
3233,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,1,"Well, I can see why people complain about YA. This one feels like it was written by a 14-year-old. It starts out rather promising, but then it just turns into a 'Tourist and Survival Guide of the Forests and Mountains' sort of book. Nothing happens -- just traveling. There's no real story arc. The blurb on the book doesn't factor in until the second half. Then the ending is incredibly anti-climactic. I had a few problems with Katsa. She is horrified of being tied down to someone in marriage but d"
3234,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,3,"Graceling (Graceling Realm #1) by Kristin Cashore is a book I had mixed feelings about. I loved the idea of having these skills or Grace. The first couple of chapters had me very interested but then it started leaving me flat. I like the premise of the story, the potential, and some of the characters. I just found that it didn't have 'something' that made me want to get deep into this world. It was an okay read but I doubt I will follow the series. I got this book from the library."
3235,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,"THE SHORT Graceling had a bit of a slow start and it took me a little while to get into the story, but when it did I was completely hooked! I loved the development of the story, the characters, the Graces. I loved the setting and learning about the Kingdoms. I loved Katsa's strength, and I adored Po. THE LONG Video Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvome..."
3236,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,"This review appears on Happy Indulgence - Check it out for more reviews! Graceling is strong on feminism values, with a heroine that refuses to wear dresses and look pretty, who is powerless to change her own situation, and while this is applied with a heavy hand at times, I appreciated this female empowerment. If there’s anyone that could be defined as kick ass, it would be Katsa. She’s blessed with the Grace of Killing, ready to cause death on anyone in a single touch. I absolutely adored Katsa"
3237,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,3,"3.5 STARS Loved the world, the magic, and Katsa and Po are great together! Also, Bitterblue is adorable and I want nothing but the world for her (view spoiler) [ The one problem I had with this, though, was the action. So much of the pivotal scenes felt very anticlimactic and rushed. This was a solid start to a series, and I'm looking forward to continuing on, but it's not a favorite. (hide spoiler) ]"
3238,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,2,"This one has been getting a lot of praise, but it didn't do much for me. Although I liked the premise––a strong heroine with a moral dilemma! danger and intrigue!––and the first scene drew me in, I was disappointed by the execution. The world felt unimaginative and barely sketched-out (to the point that the names of five out of seven kingdoms are thinly disguised versions of North, South, East, West, and Middle); the plot was thin and most of the characters flat. The 'some people have special po"
3239,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,3,"Actual rating: 3.5 The first time I read Graceling, I wasn't so impressed, I stop reading after Chapter 2. Then, last year, I decided to give it a shot again. It took me weeks to finish the novel but at least I have finished it. Graceling, at first glance, is not that captivating for my taste. The concept of Grace is interesting yet it didn't sway me to fully enjoy the first few chapters of this book. I almost give up. But I still trudged to read Graceling because well, I am no quitter. The second"
3240,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,"Well, this book was definitely a huge surprise. I mean, I knew I would like it big time because there wasn't a single person who didn't give a 5 star review to this book, but I never though I would like it this much. It was such a different and original world. I loved the idea of the Gracelings. Specially the heroine's grace. I had forgotten how a good YA's story should be like. This book had everything I usually look for in my reads covered: amazing world building, great plot developing and very"
3241,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,"4 Interesting, and beautiful stars. I don't know why I hesitated to read this one, because it was a solid read. There weren't big flaws, or any reason why this book isn't a 5 star book, except the fact that it wasn't the most original of concepts, and it wasn't the most gripping of books, but I liked the characters, and this was a book I definitely do not regret reading this. This review will be short, because I don't have strong opinions on this read. Was this my favorite? No. Will I read the c"
3242,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,"This book was AMAZINGGGGG!!! I loved how powerful Katsa felt, but that she still allowed herself to be vulnerable at times, and really realized her own strength and abilities with time. The romance was great, but didn't overpower the story or make Katsa make dumb decisions. But Po, oh Po, I loved him from the very beginning. The mystery was awesome. When everything comes together, you're like ""Oh my gosh, this book is the s***."" I loved it from beginning to end, and best of all, no cliffhanger,"
3243,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,3,"I liked it! Just...not enough happened? I don't know ;A; I loved Bitterblue though she was soo cute, so of course I'll continue the series! I think Graceling was only 3 stars because it was a lot of world building - and there was a bit of an info-dump at the beginning - but now that's out the way, I'm ready to continue! Three stars is okay, guys, don't panic. My average rating for last year was like 2.5 stars, so this is GOOD!"

3246,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,"Tamora Pierce blurbs this book saying, ""Here's a WOW of a book,"" and that sums up my feelings pretty well. Kristin Cashore has created an intensely interesting world and peopled it with characters that sparkle with complexity and life. The terms fast paced and compulsively readable can't be used often enough here. There are moments in the plot that literally made me gasp out loud but the core of the book is the naturallly evolving development of the characters who take control of the reader's he"

3249,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,"Warning : So this might be a bit long, but you know, love equals word vomit. In all situations. Katsa didn't know how long they'd been grappling when she realised he was laughing. She understood his joy, understood it completely. She'd never had such a fight, she'd never had such an opponent. She was faster than he was offensively - much faster - but he was stronger, and it was as if he had a premonition of her every turn and strike; she'd never known a fighter so quick to defend himself. She was"
3250,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,2,"2.5 STARS Vanilla. And 2008. That's my review of this book. (view spoiler) [ Despite being a fantasy book, for some reason Graceling read very different from the recent YA-fantasy books I've been reading. There's a hollowness in the world building, I never connected with the characters and their troubles and some of the message this book tried to cut across was done quite crudely. Some of the recent books that I've read from this genre rely on some level of familiarity in setting the foundations of"
3251,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,"Solid 4 stars. Fascinating fantasy world that was great for a debut novel. It reminded me of Lord of the Rings, just without the magical creatures. Can't wait to read the next one!"
3252,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,3,"3,5 Po & Katsa Stars I was pleasantly surprised by the world Kristin Cashore wrote, the kingdoms, the Graceling system, the characters. For sure it has great potential and I will be reading further books in the series. Yet some of my reading necessities weren't accomplished with this book, curiously I do think that maybe this exact same thing that lowers my rating are the ones that increased it for other people. The novel dives right into the action, there is not a subtle warning or a littl"
3253,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,2,"Get ready for a bloody review. If you're a fangirl or fanboy of Graceling , I warn you to stay away before I make you cry with hatred for me. I picked up this book with the expectations of either hating it or loving it and I came to the conclusion that Graceling doesn't deserve either my love or hatred. It deserves to bleed like the disappointment bleeding through its pages. (Close enough.) If there's anyone I wish to stun at dinner, I'll hit him in the face. So much hitting. So much crying. Like se"
3254,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,"I have to say that I loved this book. Once I started reading, I could barely put it down. The characters were fun and real, or as real as they could be in a world where extraordinary and almost supernatural talents are, maybe a little less than common, but not unusual. This is definitely fantasy, and the characters were fantastic, but still realistic. Katsa was such a wonderful character. Graced with the ability to fight and kill with ease, she is used as a weapon and Royal Leg-Breaker by the Kin"
3255,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,"Graceling, the first book in the Seven Kingdoms Trilogy, is a refined and adventurous read, with an unforgettable heroine. From the first page, I loved Graceling. I loved the sophisticated prose that somehow managed to be beautifully written but still ‘easy reading’. I loved Katsa, a protagonist with grit and compassion, and I loved the seamlessly written action that urged me to turn page after page. Kristin Cashore is an addictive voice and I followed it willingly, buying Fire (the second novel i"
3256,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,"This is the book, along with its companion Fire that got me interested in high fantasies, which is my favorite genre, and in reading in general. I don't know how my love for reading would have been like without this book. I remember how I found it in a Barnes & Noble and begged my parents to buy it for me. I remember reading about this amazing world where they are people called Gracelings and how one young woman in particular believed too much in the image other people had created for her. K"

Luckily it picked up, and I was totally caught up in the adventures of the Lady Katsa and Prince Po. Its a good read, the whole Graceling thing was actually really interesting, and once it picked up after the beginning, I got through it quickly.

3261,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,I am writing this from my grave bc I am DEAD. Graceling was hyped (FOR GOOD REASON KATIE!!!!) and therefore i avoided it for 5+ YEARS. I'm not even joking. When I opened the book there was a receipt from when I bought it in 2012. This was epic and beautiful and soul crushing. I felt so much for all of these characters and sobbed when something terrible happened to them (which was often excuse you Cashore). I just want to continue to read about Katsa and Po and Bitterblue and just all of them OK!
3262,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,"My all-time favorite reviewer was Roger Ebert. I learned a lot from checking out his movie reviews: you can like different sorts of stories for different reasons; you should not use a one size fits all standard, but adapt your style to the sort of tale you are reviewing (as in don't judge an action movie like ""Mad Max"" the same way as an introspective Ingmar Bergman drama); most importantly, when you decide on a rating, make it personal: did I enjoy it or not? did I learn anything useful, or did"

So if I can remember right, I spent around $20 on the book. So in comes the real question. Was it worth it? My answer would have to be a huge, whopping yes. This book was such a great investment. I have leant it to so many friends, all of them have loved it, but it all would not have been worth it had I not loved or even liked it. Whi"
3264,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,1,"This book is a very good example of how the fantasy genre has become irretrievably polluted by Stephanie Meyerism. I've read three chapters so far, and have no desire to read any more, for three reasons. (You could also call them Three Good Pieces of Advice for young fantasy writers.) 1) If you're going to write about fighting, take a martial arts class. Or at least talk to someone who has. You'll avoid writing idiotic sentences like: ""She ducked under his blade and whirled her foot out, clipping"

I found the second half to be a tad boring in some chapters and the final showdown was really.. uneventful, in my honest opinion, but other than that? I looooooved this book! I cried, laughed, swooned, rooted for these characters. Graceling was so adorable and shippy! My paperback is marked in over 30 places just because this glorious ship.

The king who rules her country uses her as a hired thug to break the thumbs of people he doesn't like. But then she meets this guy she likes, and decides that maybe she shouldn't be a thug anymore. Also, the guy, Po, has a lot of distant relatives who are in distress, so they have to spend a lot of time riding around trying to help those people. This was a strange book"
3268,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,"GRACELING only gets better as it unfolds: a classic fantasy genre piece about two warriors with competing, compelling supernatural strengths evolves into a love story about love, about the fantasy of ever really knowing, understanding, respecting the ones we love. The ideal of companionship and compassion deepens and complicates what would otherwise be a simple romance story. For all the flying blades and bruised bones, it's the finely drawn emotional struggles of Po and Katsa, the arc of their"
3269,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,3,"This book is everywhere; I always see it in bookstores and see reviews about it, which is what led me to begin reading the series (yes I know, I am many years late). This book started well, there was potential, but it was quite obvious I was reading a book that was written many years ago for an age group a bit younger than myself. I’ll keep this short, but what annoyed me the most was the ending. Like most readers, I expect a big finale, and while the story began to build up and the conclusion b"

3272,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,3,"3.5 stars I am kind of torn on this book. There were things I liked a lot, and then there were things that were very ‘meh’. Characters: Katsa was a pretty strong character; she kicked ass and was firm in her resolve. This being said, she was a little too good at EVERYTHING. I understand why, but it did lend an implausible air to some of what was going on in the story. Po was also a very likable character, but again, he was too good. He differed from Katsa’s goodness in that it wasn’t necessarily s"

Despite me only have read a few fantasy books (I could probably tick them off on one hand) I have to say Graceling is a brilliant example of exactly how a fantasy novel should be done. Now I’m no expert on this, but Cashore creates a wonderful world, that’s truly believable, but doesn’t once overwhelm you with the deta"
3274,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,"Rather enjoyed this fantasy. It has a lot of the usual tropes of the genre but Cashore's writing style and the compelling plot engaged my interest, and I ended up reading this non-stop, wanting to find out what was going to happen (isn't it always the case?). The whole notion of gracelings is again not a new one but it works, and the author gives us a nice cast, if a little stereotyped. Bitterblue was especially likeable in her determination, and of course the main two protagonists. Katsa is the"
3276,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,"There are so many wonderful things about this book! First of all, I love the world and the concept of Gracelings. It is so refreshing to come across someone with new ideas. And of course the female lead, Katsa, is so utterly kick butt! I love how she can even out-fight Po, the male lead, and he is ok with that. The first part was awesome, when Katsa still didnt know what his Grace was and he kept giving her funny little looks that she couldnt decipher. It made him so mysterious. Not that Po wasn"
3277,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,"BRILLIANT! SUPERB! The best Fantasy YA book I've ever read! Cashore is a gifted writer indeed. I love everything about this book, the characters, the setting, the plot and the uniqueness of it. For me, it's like a combination of fantasy and historical romance, a total package of a wonderful book. At first, I was hesitant to read it. The first three pages had me confused, I couldn't get into it. I had to adjust with the language used, because it has been a long time since I've read books like it."
3278,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,2,This was such a big disappointment. I expected better but I only something really boring that just dragged for me. I actually don't have a problem with Katsa. She is great. Po fell flat and well I dnfed it a little over 50%. The plot is the main aspect that made me rate this so low. I think the plot was really weak. The world created is unique but the plot is very much off point and boring. I can't just read the Hunger Games if I want to read about survival. Oh and before I forget Po is just so pr
3279,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,2,"I enjoyed the premise of this book. It had some action-packed scenes as well as some tasteful romance throughout. But let's get real, the only reason I finished this book was because of Prince Po! I did not enjoy Katsa's personality whatsoever. The only thing I liked about her was her name. My major complaint is the stigma Cashore tends to put on marriage throughout the entire book. Okay, now let me elaborate on the above-noted complaint. Throughout this whole book it is implied that if you get m"

Katsa is a ""graced"" fighter, tougher and stronger than any man, but with a great heart she doesn't even know she has. Po is a gentleman warrior, sweet, romantic, and a great match for Katsa. Bitterblue is a ten year old princess who's been through some terrible times yet she perseveres. Actually, I almost got to love her as much as Katsa and Po. Maybe even more. There are other wonderful characters: Raffin, Oll, Skye, Helda. And the vil"

It has a unique approach to the genre, to relationships, and to characters. At times Katsa can come across as somewhat simplistic & single minded, but that I think is part of her character, not necessarily a design flaw. This book definitely remains in my pantheon of my favorite books ever!"

Graceling is the first book in a YA fantasy trilogy (the two other books are apparently set in the same world but each of the books are able to stand on their own). This world is divided into seven kingdoms all of them ruled by more or less useless and power hungry kings who care more about their own power and fortune than their people. To combat that the so called 'Council' was fo

I was a bit nervous about reading it again, this time for the fifth time, as I worried that I wouldn't love it as much as I did years before. I shouldn't have worried. It is the best book. Graceling is still my favorite book. The characters are beyond amazing. And I love this romance more than I can say. This book still made me cry, even though"

The protagonist, Katsa, is graced with the ability to kill people. So, obviously I was expecting a super badass girl who had zero fucks to give to people. I also really liked Po.

Some gracelings are blessed with absurd graces, such as ability to hold breath for hours underwater. Some graced with practical skills such as cooking or combat skills. Some graced with powers to see the future. And one is blessed with th"
3304,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,"""Graceling"" is about Katsa, a half-wild girl who is graced, or given the unique power of killing. Katsa despises herself because of her grace, and is constantly losing her temper while serving under her uncle - King Randa's - court. In the mystical world of this book there are seven kingdoms, each with different rulers and graced individuals. One day Katsa meets a young man named Po, who is graced with fighting skills, and from the day she meets him onward her life will be forever changed by the"
3305,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,"I did it again--skipped classes and writing a paper to read a book, and once again will take the penalty for a late paper. It was worth it. Except for a few slow chapters in the middle, it was page turner. Highly recommend for those who like The Hunger Games and Poison Study . A 4 1/2 star rating really. YABC Graceling Discussion"
3306,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,"Took me nearly a week to get through but that was due to my own ineptitude and nothing to do with this wonderful book. My goodness. Talk about strong female leads and flawless character development. Still kind of in shock over that story and the realm Cashore has created within the pages of this book. And the characters. I feel like I know them so well and I have different loves for each of them. If you're looking for a good fantasy with an awesome premise and even more amazing characters, this i"

3308,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,1,"Alright people. Let me tell you about this awful piece of crap. So the only part I enjoyed reading about was the first 10 pages where there was actually a plan in action. Otherwise, throughout the rest of this dreadful read, there was no plot whatsoever. NO PLOT AT ALL. The whole book is basically Katsa, Po, and Bitterblue walking around and trying to survive. It dragged on soooooo much. Ok. Let me explain my total dislike for all the characters. The main character is named Katsa and she is grac"

It's so comforting to reread an old favorite. I love Katsa and Po! And Leck is such a creepy villain. _______________________ August 2011 review: Originally posted here.

3310,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,"Katsa has been able to kill a man with her bare hands since she was eight - she's a Graceling, one of the rare people in her land born with an extreme skill. As niece of the king, she should be able to live a life of privilege, but Graced as she is with killing, she is forced to work as the king's thug. When she first meets Prince Po, Graced with combat skills, Katsa has no hint of how her life is about to change. She never expects to become Po's friend. She never expects to learn a new truth about"

Marked by mismatched eyes, each Graceling has a specific and almost superhuman skill--excellence at baking, at swimming underwater, at dancing or fighting. At age 8, Graceling Katsa killed a man. Ever since, her uncle, King Randa, has used her as his enforcer and assassin. Despite her reputation as a mindless killer whose bloodlust is only held in check by her uncle, Katsa is growing increasingly unco"
3312,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,"This was my first experience with an Audiobook and I was pleasantly surprised. I loved that it had a full cast audio and the narrator was great. I'm not a huge fan of Fantasy novels. I only picked this up because it was recommended by a lot of my friends and I found an audiobook version of it when I needed one. I'm pretty sure that if I would have read it rather than listen to it, it would have gotten a 3 star. I would have likely felt bored about half way through. But the audiobook went along p"
3313,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,"Dang this book was awesome!!! but I'm confused because the next book is Fire and the third should be Bitterblue, so why is there an additional chapter of Bitterblue at the end of Graceling?? Well anyways... this book. This. Book. Katsa is like the coolest female protagonist. Like ever. Po is a cinnamon bun. Bitterblue is the cutest thing it the world. Raffin just randomly reminds me of Dorian AND GIDDON YOU LITTLE SHIET. I just really don't like Giddon okay? just UGH. I loved the relationship de"

When I saw it at the used book sale I scooped it up right away. Once again I found myself hopeful that this one would live up to the hype, as a lot of books I have read lately haven't. I've heard such great things about this series, so I had to give it a shot. I could not be crazier about a book. It started off kind of slow and to be honest I almost set it down."
3315,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,"Simply...Astonishing!!! Graceling is a wonderfully put together masterpiece that takes us on a journey that is beyond our imagination! Kristin Cashore's debut novel makes her mark with this uniquely fashioned story that adds so much flavor to Mythical Fantasy! Graceling has it all! A story about self discovery, Love, betrayal, madness, liberty, strength, power, greed and so many other wonders that clings to each page of this Epic tale! Katsa and Po have a fierce, intense love story that is all-cons"
3316,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,2,"I don't understand the hype. Maybe it's because I read it this year - it was published in 2008, probably Graceling felt like a much better book back then. But today? If you've read some YA fantasy, you've already read this. It's very, very bland. The worldbuilding isn't great. Gracelings are so powerful and not that rare and there doesn't seem to be systemic discrimination (or if there was - I'm writing the review a few months later... - it was barely touched upon) and yet most of the kings of the"

Katsa is Graced, meaning that in her home country of the Middluns she is shunned by most people and practically owned by her uncle the king who values her Grace. (A Grace is a talent for something, and Katsa's appears to be killing.) She meets a young man, also Graced, who comes from a country where the Graced are celebrated, and together they embark on a journey to solve a mysterious crime. Along the way they uncover secrets about thems"
3320,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,"Graceling is absolutely enchanting and has earned a special place as one of my all time favorite books. Kristin Cashore has created a magical world with a compelling and respectable heroine, heart-breaking hero, and a fast-paced, surprising adventure. Filled with choice, sarrow, love, self-discovery and grace, Graceling will keep you up until the wee hours of the night and tickle your thoughts, long after you've read the last page."
3321,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,1,This book was just bad. The dialogue angered me. The book itself is just plain bad. I can't seem to find better words for it. It was boring and just poorly written. The imagination of the author I must say is wonderful. She seemed to have the ideas down. It was just that the execution was poorly presented.
3322,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,2,"Another two star book, I'm not having much luck at the moment! I picked this book up again (for the third attempt) whilst on holiday; this time I managed to struggle all the way to the end. It definitely picked up around 35% of the way through, when it actually became enjoyable, but before that it was a complete slog. This book makes you work for the fun."
3323,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,Finally got to this one! I loved it! Poor Po Po. I'm disappointed to now realize the next two books are not about them. Hopefully there are some cameos? Especially in Bitterblue I would think Katsa and Po would be around.
3324,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,3,Cute teenagey story. I liked it enough that I would read the remaining books in this series.

Nor should you fight me when I'm angry.” I really enjoyed this book. No surprise that it gained such popularity. It was full of action, romance, a kick-ass, strong and independent heroine, a respectful, dreamy book-boyfriend, amazing and funny secondary characters, an amazing plot and yes, even a drama and annoying tantrums. “I told you before, Katsa. I won't fight when yo"

This was one of the few books by an author I've never read before that I didn't approach with caution, that I truly expected to enjoy. After all, there were countless positive reviews, both from my friends and the GoodReads community in general. But... I'm really wondering whether or not we read the same book. My first problem with the book came right off the bat. Actually, my first two problems, but I'll get to the second one later. The first one came"

I haven’t read high fantasy in ages and I haven’t read on my kindle even longer than that and I believe making both of those changes now really helped me out of my ongoing reading slump. I’ve actually finished a book in less than two days!!! And a long book at that!!! I’m so happy about this, it’s ridiculous.

It had been collecting dust on my shelf for over four years which is unacceptable! I was actually very reluctant to pick it up after reading some very negative reviews about it (I’m sorry but I’m gonna be ranting about this at the very end of the review so I won’t be upset if you ignore it haha). I honestly just need to learn to make my own opinions, because I was surprised by how"
3331,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,"The best part of this book was Po. Like by far. I love him so much!! To be honest, it was almost a 3 star read for me because the writing style was terribly inconsistent. Sometimes it read very fluent and easily and sometimes it read like the worst fanfic on the interwebs. Like, how?! Was there no editor? Sometimes it switched on the middle of a page and you were completely ripped out of the reading pleasure and had to push through these party. Also Katsa, the protagonist definitely has an undiag"

3333,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,2,"As seen on Zombie Mommies . Maybe my expectations were too high. Maybe I thought the story would center on the adventures of a female ""James Bond."" Instead, all I got was a bad taste in my mouth. It's not that Graceling was so poorly written: I actually found the writing style and world building nicely done. It's just that...I think I was lied to. First , Cashore refers to Graceling as growing ""from her daydreams about a girl who possesses extrodinary powers--and who forms a friendship with a boy wi"
3334,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,"Fantasy is a new genre for me to read. I loved Poison Study , so I have been trying more books from the ""fantasy"" section and enjoying them. This book was loved by everyone I know,and I can see why. It is such a wonderfully imaginative story that weaves together a beautiful world with multi-dimensional characters. Katsa is the niece of king who is kind of a jerk, and since she is ""graced"" with the power of amazing fighting skills, the jerk-king uses her as his thug to go out and break legs or chop"
3335,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,"★★★★  stars! An exceptional young adult fantasy book. There is plenty to like here, with a beta hero to-die-for, enough insight into real life to keep me interested, and a few nice twists to keep the surprise going. I also think it is perfect as a ""buddy read"" - which is how I read it. Update: 6/9/11 (view spoiler) [ Wow! I didn’t realize this book was so controversial. I have read some of the reviews and comments and all I can say is that I do agree with the “double standard” issue in that if it"
3336,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,"One thing I really like about this book is that it's part fantasy/part romance, but the romance doesn't derail the MC's quest. Yes, Katsa falls in love and it was never her plan, but she doesn't just throw away everything else she had planned because she falls in love. Katsa insists she never wants to get married, she doesn't want to be anyone's wife and she doesn't want to compromise her own desires for any man. I love this story because she DOES NOT change her mind in the end. Although she adm"
3337,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,3,"This book was hard for me. I think my expectations were just too high. I loved the premise of the book and the concept of Graces. I felt that there was confusion by the author though. The actual writing was at a fairly low level, geared towards a much younger audience than much of the content meshed up with for me. I felt as though this idea could have been done in a much better way. It felt like it was lacking polish for me. I did really enjoy the characters, but I couldn't FEEL much emotion be"
3338,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,3,"Graceling is a reread for me, but one that still managed to be better than I expected. It was a sensation in the teen library group I was a part of in high school, in no small part because Cashore’s protagonist, Katsa, is a sharp contrast to Bella Swan. It wasn’t until years later, long after I had read both Graceling and its companion, Fire , that I encountered criticism of Katsa as a Strong Female Character whose strength derives from being as masculine as possible. Returning to the series with"
3339,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,"I'm not gonna lie, I had some problems with the first half. I felt like themes were being thrown at me from every which way. & Katsa ::sigh:: Girl, I understand you're going through a lot, but damn, way to think the world revolves around you. But then it hit the second half and I really enjoyed it - it became a real fantasy adventure story. & Katsa was better suited as a protector-figure instead of a self-absorbed girl against the world. It re-instated my faith in Cashore (I read and lov"

Things change when she meets Prince Po who is also a Graceling. Can she help him save the Kingdom from evil? Read on and find out for yourself.

3341,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,I loved this book it was so very well written I was on the edge of my seat from the very first page. I loved the characters especially Katsa and Po I also liked Bitterblue they were well written and were so very likable. I loved the story it progressed at a steady and even pace it was action packed and I loved everything about this book will be continuing this series soon. So overall I really enjoyed this book and will read more of this series.
3342,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,Simply epic!
3343,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,2,"So… that was a book. With the exception of Katsa’s relationship with Po (and even that was problematic to some degree), I don’t think this book has much going for it. The story is okay and the villain had potential, but everything else was a disaster. In a world where a small number of children develop a special ability (i.e., a superpower; i.e., the X-men trope once again), Katsa is graced with “killing.” Her uncle, the king, uses her as a thug to punish the (usually innocent) people who cross h"

This time, I sat down and actually read this and all I have to say is I'm very disappointed in myself for not reading this sooner. I'm not sure how to put my love for this book into words. There were powers and squabbling kingdoms. Cashore made this a magical read. All the characters were so wonderful. And the romance? I actually liked the romance. I"

3346,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,2,"*rubs temples* I did enjoy this book, when it wasn't focusing on Katsa. I enjoyed the world, the idea of the Graced, etc. I loved Bitterblue to death, and Skye, and Po. Loved it. Ohhhh, but did I hate Katsa. I already know about the feminist debate, and honestly, all I have to say is, is that I do not enjoy someone's beliefs shoved down my throat, and that is what I felt happening whenever Cashore mentioned marriage, children, and sex. I respect your decisions if you do not wish to be married/hav"
3347,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,"This book was recommended by a classmate of my English 12 class who was kind enough to guide me through the class itself and through the library (it was big!) at the beginning of my exchange year in the USA. She recommended it to me because I liked The Hunger Games trilogy, again... those books just opened the door for so many others! I was expecting a strong princess, killing, romance etc and indeed there was all of that but not the way I thought. THE WORLD : Let's see, the story takes place in a"
3348,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,"Also posted on my blog, Rinn Reads . Oh Graceling . What a total and unexpected joy you were. From the very first page, with a thrilling opening scene, I loved this book so much more than I thought I would. We learn that in this world some people are born with Graces - great skills that vary from person to person, some rather useless and some incredibly useful. These people stand out from others by their different coloured eyes, and are actually shunned, or rather feared, for their abilities. The m"

3350,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,"Audiobook Review: A fantastic action filled book that kept me gasping and screaming inside throughout the entire audiobook experience. Emma Powell may sound a little monotonous when the story commences, but at the end do I only love her voice and how she manages to switch to each character's voice flawlessly. I will definitely be buying the audiobook of Fire to hear her lovely narration once again. To be one hundred percent honest, I've picked this book up at least 3 times from the library in at"
3351,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,"I’ve read Graceling before, and I wasn’t quite sure what to think of it then. The anti-marriage plot and Katsa’s rejections of femininity didn’t sit well with me then; not because I’m that vociferously pro-marriage or that insistent on anyone being feminine, but I think I was looking for someone more like Celaena back then. Someone who could fight and survive and still be a woman, and not view feminine pursuits or interests as weak. Katsa isn’t that at all: she’s a woman who has been mostly forc"
3352,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,2,"I was sucked into the story right from the start and at the end of each chapter I wanted to keep reading to find out what would happen next. Although our main hero “Po” was stuck with a kind of lame name, I still found myself totally liking him. The chemistry between him and Katsa was fantastic (at least in the beginning). I liked Katsa’s character, I felt bad that she was graced with killing and had to perform some pretty horrible things as a young girl, but now at eighteen she finally stands o"
3354,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,"(Source: I own a copy of this book.) Katsa lives in a world where some people develop a special talent called a ‘Grace’. These people are marked by having two different colour eyes, and Katsa herself has a very unique gift – the Grace of Killing. If Katsa intends to kill someone, she can do it without weapons, even barehanded against many trained swordsmen. Katsa has also started a special council though, that works for the good of the people, and her latest endeavour has been to save a very impor"
3355,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,"So I finally jumped on the Graceling bandwagon, and honestly people, if one of you had just beat me over the head with this book 4 years ago and told me that the series was full of complete stories that didn’t depend on one-another, I would have read it a long time ago. Clearly this is all your fault. But I’m willing to forgive and forget because I loved Graceling. This book swept me away as only fantastic fantasy can do, compelling me to neglect every other aspect of my life until I’d read the"
3356,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,1,"I just remembered to add this book on the list of the books I've read. It's been a while since I read it too and I can't understand how I could possibly forget Graceling... because it is so bad it really stands out. The saddest thing about it being horrible is that this book had a huge potential. The idea of graces was amazing, the Seven Kingdoms, Katsa's unusual eyes.. What ruined it all though, was the main character - Katsa. It was obvious she was supposed to be a strong female character, the"
3357,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,What a good freaking book! I can already tell this is a series I will cherish and wish I had purchased in hardback. Some series own me and this is bound to be one of them! The world is so unique-- mad props to Kristin Cashore. The seven kingdoms were each so different both politically and culturally. The idea of a graceling is brilliant. It was so interesting to watch these characters come to terms with the true definition of their grace as they learned its purpose and how to use it. Katsa was a

3359,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"All the stars! Final review, first posted on Fantasy Literature : Peter S. Beagle’s classic The Last Unicorn turns fifty years old this year, and it’s remained in the public eye and continues to capture hearts like very few fantasies of its age. Like a fine tapestry, this gorgeous fairy tale weaves together unicorns and harpies, wizards and witches, dark-hearted kings and brave heroes. Its lyrical language is embellished with whimsical humor and given heft by bittersweet life lessons. A shy unicorn"

3362,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"I'll get straight to the point on this, read it, read it now. The Last Unicorn (1968) is a classic and not without reason. The third-person narrative centers on a unicorn who, believing she is the last of her kind in the world, sets off on a journey to discover what has happened to the others. She encounters a host of diverse characters as her journey progresses, each of them bringing her closer to her goal.

3364,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,"“We are not always what we seem, and hardly ever what we dream.” In my mind, the movie The Last Unicorn will forever be known as the first and so far only book, movie or TV show to ever give me nightmares. I think I saw the film for the first time when I was about 5 or 6 and I remember being completely entranced by it. It immediately became one of my favourite movies, despite the fact that I couldn’t sleep for a week after seeing it for the first time. I never realised it was originally a novel"
3365,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"This Unicorn, along with Ende's Neverending Story and Zindell's Requiem for Homo Sapiens , has made me what I am. It has been there for me to shine and shiver with its seashell light even in the deepest night. It has been there to remind me that great heroes need great sorrows and burdens, otherwise half their greatness goes unnoticed. That you can't make real magic by offering up someone else's liver; you must tear out your own. (And not expect to get it back, aye.) It's been a song and a com"
3366,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"“Who has choices need not choose. We must, who have none. We can love but what we lose - What is gone is gone.” The main problem with mythical beasts is that they are so mythical they become their own cliches. Dragons have been their own ultimate victims. The same can be said about mermaids, elves, and, of course, unicorns. And yet, Mr Beagle, offers us a unicorn that is unlike anything you could expect: alluring yet strange, beautiful enough to make you cry but at the same time beautiful so much"

Sure, I feel a little haggard after drinking the damn stuff, and it also makes you blind and contributes toward a murderous rage toward all unicorns, but the drink does grow on you! It's just a shame that it makes all the little girls cry. *sigh* That being said the novel itself is a rather wonderful and clear and a perfect example of a self-aware fairy-tale. The fact that it stays simple and strong is a testament to its great writing. Better than that, howe"
3368,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"This was one of the first satisfying fantasy reads that I found after The Lord of the Rings. I read it when I came home from my first year of college, in 1970. For a long time, I felt like I was the only person who had read this book. Then, slowly, slowly, the recognition for it began to grow. The movie came out, so wondrously tied to the book (and well it should be: the author wrote the screenplay) and I loved it almost as much as the book. All these years later, it is a pleasure to see it gaini"
3369,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,2,"You know what? I give up! I've been reading this for over two months and every time I picked it up I was so bored and confused. Maybe one day I'll go back and read it in a shorter time span, but idk. The writing was gorgeous and the metaphors were nice, but I couldn't connect to the story at all, there wasn't enough of the unicorn, and it was just strange. It had this quality to it that was like The Little Prince where there seems like there will be some deeper, darker message concealed with a lo"
3370,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,"Wonderful story that I read waaay too late in the game! The Last Unicorn is a great quest novel with a driven character in search of the most sympathetic of causes, to find out if she is the last of her kind. It's filled with a bevy of almost Alice-in-Wonderland-interesting side characters...although I could've done without the names, especially Schmendrick, the bumbling wizard. Come on. Honestly, that last point is what holds this back from being a truly great classic in my eyes. Let me explain.."
3371,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,3,"I read this mainly because I've heard it's a fantasy classic, and felt I should. It was indeed magical, and read like a true fairytale with a unicorn and other mythical creatures, a noble prince with quests, a wizard, and an evil king. I can see why it's a classic. I'm only giving it 3 stars, though, because the emotional connection and immediateness of more modern fantasy isn't there, and it felt like watching the story from afar. The characters definitely felt emotions. Intellectually, I know t"

It is a charming classic that has stood the test of time well, even though a great deal of good fantasy has been published since it first appeared. It's message that we should learn to lead our lives well is just as relevant today. The characters are quirky and funny.

3374,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,"Magical. One of the best children's fantasy books that I've ever read. The prose is as enchanting as the unicorn. Everytime the unicorn appears, thinks and speaks, I am thrown out of this world. Peter Beagle (born 1939) is a scintillating American author and he's got a equally dazzling character to mark his place in this literary world - none other than what people say as a legendary yet fictional animal, the most important imaginary animal of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance - the unicorn.

3375,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"5.0 stars. WOW, why did it take me so long to get around to reading this extraordinary novel!! I actually only decided to read this now because one of my favorite authors, Patrick Rothfuss, mentioned that it was one of his favorite novels of all time. Well, I can certainly see why. This is fantasy at its best. Beautifully written, smart and full of heart. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"

3378,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"The first encounter I had with The Last Unicorn was as a child (how fitting) when my step-dad introduced me to the movie. I remember falling in love with the art and the music and I've watched the movie once every year ever since. Then, a while later, I got the book and read it (the German translation). It was very good and different from the movie in some places (for example, the story of the curse and the village before Haggard's castle). But for the longest time, it was usually me and the movi"
3379,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"This book may fool you. It's not a once-upon-a-time tale, nor is it just for children. When I first picked up this book, all I knew about it was that a trusted friend - whose book recommendations have never led me astray - loved it. I was under the impression that it was for children, and even though I am a self-described kid at heart and stalwart defender of children's literature, I thought it would be a light read, devoid of any complexities. Well, I was wrong. The story begins in the lilac woo"

""As for her, she is a story with no ending, happy or sad. She can never belong to anything mortal enough to want her."" What a weenie am I! I actually got all misty eyed near the end of this book. Really a sweet story filled with colorfully drawn characters and writing that engages all six of your senses. I don't know why I never found this book when I was a young"
3381,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"I can see why this is such a fantasy classic. I was well-served to read it alongside other people, forced to read only a few chapters a week - this allowed me to notice more things and appreciate the small bits in a way I don't usually do. Besides having a decent story, Beagle has a good balance of quirky, humor, romance, and deep thoughts. Perfect for younger and older readers."
3382,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,"I seriously wonder if Peter S. Beagle has Synesthesia. His choice of adjectives is beautiful and downright tasty. Sounds have color and texture, it's as if he was able to show people what it would be like to walk into a Van Gogh painting and live inside it. His plot is not as it seems, at first appearing cliche (you may find yourself thinking ""This is like the start of hundreds of fairy tales I've read as a kid"") but you will be delightfully proven wrong. His characters are unique and experience"
3383,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,"I first read “The Last Unicorn” in my twenties and I didn’t really enjoy it as I was not into unicorns at all. A few years back, however, I came across Michael Green’s wonderful book “The Unicornis Manuscripts on the History and Truth of the Unicorn” and from then on I was hooked on these mythical creatures. So when I reread Peter Beagle’s book, I was quite intrigued to see that I preferred it much more the second time around. It’s one of those amazing books for all age groups. It must have been"
3384,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,"I've been hearing for years and years that The Last Unicorn is a must read for fantasy fans. It's true. The Last Unicorn is the story of a unicorn living alone in a wood that finds out she's the last and goes searching for her people. Along the way, she meets a bumbling wizard named Schmendrick, a feisty woman named Molly, and eventually a layabout prince named Lir. As with A Fine and Private Place , Beagle's writing is spotted with humor. I can see his influence in Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett'"

I felt vaguely enchanted by it -- not in the sense of it being twee and sweet and Disney, but in the sense of it having a hold over me. I loved the writing, the richness of it, the strange and new descriptions, e.g. ""the air hung shiny as candy"" -- things that don't quite make logical sense, and yet, you know what they mean. I loved the fairytale qualities interspersed with bits of hum"

3391,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,"This book is written as a fairy tale but with a twist, as it's set in a fully realized but slightly satirical as much as whimsical fantasy world that has inspired everything from The Princess Bride to Stardust. And i love it! Beagle’s story is a romantic fable about a unicorn who leaves the forest she has protected since time immemorial to find more of her kin. Having never left her forest, the unicorn is surprised by the changes in the world but there's no unicorn sightings anywhere. She keeps g"

This book gets a *lot* of love on Goodreads, and I kind of see where people are coming from, but I have to admit that I didn’t have quite the same rapturous experience of this book as most. Don’t get me wrong, Beagle definitely has a way with words. His descriptive prose is very evocative and there are some moments of real lyricism here, but overall I think he did himself a disservice in a major eleme"

I gotta say, it towers above them all! 6 Stars! “Great heroes need great sorrows and burdens, or half their greatness goes unnoticed.

3397,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,3,"Read it for itself. A classic of it's type. I found this a ""mildly interesting"" book. It never pulled me in yet it was interesting enough that I stayed with it. It's sort of like a weak tea, drinkable but not something I'm overly pleased with."
3398,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,Classics are classics for a reason. Molly Grue is the truest fictional character ever written. She's more magical than even the unicorn and the wizard combined.

I'll be driving down the freeway and the slant of sunlight off of a trucks rear window will suddenly remind me of a line in one of these chapters and a fever will grab hold of me all of a sudden and it won't be quelled until I get home and reread that passage, which turns into rereading that chapter which turns into rereading this book.

Some of you might disagree, but as you read this book, you live with every word of it! You could taste and feel the coldness of Haggard's keep, and know how every characters emotion at a given situation in a given time.

I honestly thought the book might be a little corny, or possibly a bit cheesy. It wasn’t. It was honestly one of the best books I have ever read, and I am absolutely buzzing about it! Perfection. It was everything a fantastic fantasy should be! I can see now why it has been claimed as one of the greatest fantasy books of all time. 5 stars and all"

3404,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,"I listened to the audiobook for this; the narrator was the author himself. This was my first time reading the book though I recall watching the animated movie several times as a kid. I still hear Mia Farrow's voice in my head as the unicorn. I liked some of the humor that obviously went over my head when I saw the movie as a kid. I have to say, the movie followed the book pretty closely and the parts they trimmed were rather unnecessary in the book. (view spoiler) [I don't recall Lear being such"
3406,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"The Last Unicorn is quite possibly the most beautiful book ever written. The story it tells is of a quest undertaken by the last unicorn, Molly Grue, and Schmendrik the Magician to save the unicorns from the Red Bull of King Haggard. What appears at first glance to be a traditional fantasy tale winds up being far more. The Magician is the last of his own kind, however, he is also completely incompetent in his art and wishes nothing more than to find his magic so that he may be mortal and die. Mo"
3407,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"A mystical, rich, touching, fun, and stunningly-written fairy tale. I admit to having had the film in mind whilst reading this - I couldn't help it, I saw it first - but in prose form, I can say that the book is better. 'The Last Unicorn' contains wonderful passages such as: 'The unicorn lived in a lilac wood, and she lived all alone. She was very old, though she did not know it, and she was no longer the careless color of sea foam, but rather the color of snow falling on a moonlit night.' - p.1,"
3408,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,"The Last Unicorn is a unique work among works of fantasy. It stands out in many ways from modern fantasy novels and is hard to pigeonhole into a specific subgenre. It’s definitely not the more action packed, dark and bloody style of sword & sorcery, nor is it really high fantasy. In some ways it has more in common with a fairy tale than modern fantasy, or at least a mix between the two, and in that way relates more to earlier works of fantasy, when it was in its infancy, works like Lord Duns"
3409,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"I recently re-read this book as part of a group read. I've always loved it, but this is one of those books that you only realized how much you love it when you read again. Beagle's writing is prose-poetry. This book is also one of the few books that was adapted to film very well. In case you don't know, The Last Unicorn is about a unicorn who goes on quest to discover what happened to the rest of her kind. She meets a wizard and a woman who add her. On the way, she learns some un-unicorn like tra"
3411,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,"I read this when I was 7 or 8, after being taken to see the film. I enjoyed it although it was too advanced for me. I remember being confused in places and should really reread it."
3412,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,2,"I have never been so devastated by disliking a book. I've wanted to read this book for 20+ years and never gotten around to it. My husband read it a few weeks ago, reviewed it as being one of the best, most beautiful books he's ever read. He told me simply, ""You're going to love it."" So I moved it way up the list. And oh, it hurts, because, I did NOT love it. I wanted to so badly! The lyric language was quite beautiful for such a cold, cynical book. Nothing that happens really makes sense, actio"
3413,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,"Beagle continually surprised me with his unique prose. Descriptions and metaphors in odd juxtapositions that at first make no sense but then you blink and they make complete sense. His dialogue often rang with rhythm and rhyme, nudging me to re-read a snippet just to hear it roll off my tongue. A quest adventure fairy tale fantasy flipped topsy-turvy. Instead of a child pulled unwillingly along by prophecy, an undying unicorn discovers she is the last of her kind and leaves to learn their fate."
3414,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,"Beautiful. Beautiful. Pure soulful beauty. Though I still find it hard that this is compared to Tolkien's The Hobbit. Things lose their luster when they are compared. No. There is no need for comparison here. Still, this is beautiful enough on its own that it must and should be read by every fantasy genre fan."
3415,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,"We are not always what we seem, and hardly ever what we dream. Still I have read, or heard it sung, that unicorns when time was young, could tell the difference ’twixt the two—the false shining and the true, the lips’ laugh and the heart’s rue.”"
3416,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,3,"I could not get over the writing - not the fairy tale/fable like style, I don't mean that - I think it was mostly the flow - it felt just fragmented to me and jarred me off any connection with the story of the characters! And it took me awhile to get over it - so much so it colored my experience of reading the story right up to the end. So, sorry(!), it is rare that I would be unable to connect with a story that a lot of people find so endearing! But it happens I guess. Even to me. But...! This"
3417,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,3,"Sometimes you just miss the boat for some books. There is a perfect age to read a given book, and for no particular reason you just never get around to it. I remember vividly how much I liked the Rankin/Bass animated movie The Last Unicorn back in 1982, when I was just 8 years old (though it looks painfully lame now having watched a clip on YouTube). I should have read the book right then. I would have absolutely loved it. Peter Beagle’s prose is truly lyrical and evocative, and I loved that aspe"
3418,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"I grew up with the movie of this, and then realized that it was a book when I was in junior high. As crazy as I was about that strange cartoon (Alan Alda as Schmendrick!), the book was on a whole 'nother level. Gorgeously written, some of the imagery is still with me today. This is a magnificent work, and a must read for any fantasy fan."
3419,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,2,"I really didn't enjoy this book that much and honestly don't get what all the fuss is about. I found the story boring and didn't care at all about the characters, especially the unicorn. Maybe I just wasn't in the right mood for it but I could easily have skipped this one."
3421,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,3,"Far too sad for me to love it, but a good book anyway. I hated that prince Lir and the unicorn were not able to be reunited (sigh). Oh well, it was a good fairytale."
3422,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"This was my favorite animated movie growing up—that should have been my first clue that I’m crazy about symbolism—and I finally got around to reading it. It did not disappoint. The language alone is magical, a perfect companion to the story it told. I love how in describing something, Beagle used words associated with the metaphors he was using. So if he were using the sea to describe a unicorn, the unicorn’s steps would rise and fall as waves and her footprints would splash the sand. ((I don’t"
3423,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"I adored this book. It reads both as a child's fairy tale and an adult literary novel. What a marvel it is! It is full of metafictional references to ancient literature, religions, folk tales and literary symbols of every yearning common to most people for 50,000 years. The writing itself is poetic prose full of phrases which are still bringing delight to me in remembrance like a unicorn licking my face. ""Under the moon, the road that ran from the edge of her forest gleamed like water, but when s"

Still, fond memories abounded when I came across this book, and I was very excited to read it and see how it matched up with my childhood recollections of the story. I came away with this: This is no children's fairy tale. You benefit from being an adult and reading this to fully appreciate everything the story has to offer. Aside from it being beautifully wri"
3425,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,"I'd heard of this novel forever but never read it till now. The writing alone makes it justly famous: crazy, beautiful, lyrical, like Tolkien or Shakespeare crossed with '60s beat poetry. The plot is interesting enough too, feeling like a well-fleshed-out myth. But my emotions were never quite snagged by it, and I think it's because the whole thing just is too heavy on the allegory for my tastes. It's similar to when I read C.S. Lewis' novels, and can admire the lovely writing and cool fantasy b"

I always have a happy memory of my dad picking me up and popping me in front of tv with vhs and watching the cartoon of the Last unicorn. It was both mind blowing magical and just also scary! i was only 6 though!  but it was a beautiful cartoon and an absolute Fantasy classic in it's own right. And the book??? It's just how i remembered the cartoon! The cartoon is so like the book it's unreal. I l
3427,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"“The last unicorn lived in a lilac wood, and she lived all alone.” The Last Unicorn is a special little tale. I have been very fond of it since childhood and it includes several of my most loved story elements: a magician, a (talking) cat, adventure, a castle, mythical creatures, good humour and a magical atmosphere. Although it uses some of the most common patterns of fairy tales and fantasy quests, The Last Unicorn captures them and makes them its own. Molly Grue and Schmendrick are, by far,"

All I can say is that they did an amazing job making that movie because it really stayed true to the book. I could see this movie playing out again in my head while reading this even though it has been many years since I watched the movie. I loved it and now want to go and rewatch the movie! It is about the las"

Of course, The Last Unicorn topped the list. Seriously, I cannot think about unicorns without thinking about this book. And no, the unicorn in this book is not bloodthirsty. Although I had made up my mind earlier to be Team Unicorn, I think had I been on the fence, this book would definitely have pushed me onto Team Unicorn. Read the rest o"
3431,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"I saw the movie when I was a little girl and have always wanted to read the book. Considering that Peter S. Beagle wrote the screenplay, the movie stuck extremely close to the plot. I will say that because of his poetic style of writing and the songs throughout, reading this book was a bit like going through a dream. The writing is beautiful and there are some great descriptions throughout. There are a few times when I found it hard to actually get a clear image of places or objects because of i"

The plot is simple but wonderful. The characters are complex and interesting, even when we only meet them for a scene. It's insightful and yet non-judgmental. I can read this book over and over. It's one of my favorites. I can't recommend it highly enough. 2017 Reread: Just as wonderful as the first time. This remains one of the most beautifully"
3433,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,1,"This book screams ""70's FANTASY!"" - overly narrative, descriptive, and boring, with lack of any meaningful plot, the point is magic - unicorns! magicians! evil creatures! no character development or ability to identify with the main character, the Unicorn, who herself is not a very interesting character."
3434,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"Brilliant, funny and enchanting book. Though I have to admit, I saw the film adaptation first (I was six years old). Mia Farrow did a great voice job of the unicorn. This book will be loved by anyone who likes fantasy, well-written novels or anyone just looking for something good to read at random."

3436,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"I was getting pretty fed up with fantasy novels until I picked up The Last Unicorn. All of the tired fantasy tropes are done away with here. The last unicorn isn’t a tale about tough badasses. The last unicorn is old, scared and unsure. She’s not sure she has a place in the world anymore. Her wizard companion doesn’t even have a grasp on the most basic of magic spells. Their enemy is vast and unbeatable. This isn’t a Lisa Frank book. It’s whimsical, sure, but also gloomy and introspective. The La"
3437,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,"All I can think after closing this book is how wonderfully crafted this story was. It is whimsical, but wise, beautiful and kind of dark. This is a classic fantasy tale for a reason. The Last Unicorn has elements of myth, fairytale and folklore and the tone of the writing is spot on. It never digs too deep. It always feels like a tale and I like that. I guess that is the reason I never felt like I quite knew the characters, neither Molly, Schmendrick or the unicorn, and yet I cared for them even"
3439,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"Originally posted here . My love affair with this book was just way I liked it - slow-burning and unexpected. I started out feeling fairly lukewarm about the story, as it was very simple, but like a seed you didn't know was there, days went by before I realized that it has grown on me. I am not sure if it is because of Prince Lir's growth from shallow young 'un to lovesick hero, or Lady Amalthea's painful beauty, or Molly Grue's cream puff (solid on the outside but softie on the inside) persona,"
3440,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"I have seen (and read) three types of fairytale fantasy published in the last century. The first is like Patricia C. Wrede's Enchanted Forest Chronicles: it is clever at the expense of fairy tales, mocking (usually gently) the tropes of the genre, often through metafictional techniques. This type does little for me. The second is like most of Patricia McKillip's work: it takes those same tropes completely seriously and (if done well, as in McKillip's case) reminds us why the tropes exist in the"

The animation was dated (and could use a re-due with crisper colors), but I liked the characters and the story. Thankfully the book is almost the same thing as the movie (partially because the author of this book also wrote the movie's script). So if you are afraid the book is different, in this case, isn't not that different. I've always bee"

It opens with a demonstration of the charms of well-told exposition, as he describes the unicorn in her woods, but all is disturbed when two hunters come.

I had only read it once before when I was about 10, and I remembered it as being just so-so. On top of that, I'm not a big fan of most fantasy books. So I was stunned when The Last Unicorn turned out to be this heartrendingly beautiful work of art, which I clearly didn't appreciate when I was younger. I think the writi"

I know that for many it's the ultimate fantasy book, but somehow I wasn't touched by its magic. Fantasy retelling, when author minces few fairy tales or myths into one ""modern"" book are quite common, and I would regard The Last Unicorn as a very first try to make it work.

3449,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"This is another book that if rated based on my memory, I'd have been way off the mark. I'm certain it was a much different read at age 10 (or whenever the height of my unicorn-loving phase was) than now, as an adult with a stronger sense of how deep both longing and loss can be. All those themes of life and death and the beauty of the ephemeral certainly would have gone over my head. Beagle's writing is heartbreakingly beautiful and his sentiments so wise. On top of all that, this book has such a"

And written with absolutely gorgeous descriptive writing with beautiful imagery, it was an easy 5/5 stars for me. Full review on my blog: http://bastardreading.blogspot.ie/201..."
3452,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,3,"I enjoyed this whimsical story but since I put it down for a while, I fell out of love with this book. I can see why Patrick Rothfuss says this is his favorite book of all time, but wasn't really my cup of tea."
3453,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"Such a gorgeous book. This is one of the classics of fantasy, poetic, wry, tender, a luminous look at how wonder and magic can fade from the world."
3454,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,3,Enchanting tale with poetic descriptions.
3455,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,<3 Just so much Love <3..... this movie is a personal favourite of mine from my youth and the book lives up to and surpasses the movie!! If you haven't read it - you should!!
3456,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"I've known this was originally a book for a long time, but the animated adaptation was my first introduction to this story. I'm surprised, actually, by how close the adaptation was, and how well the characters' voices and visages matched the tone of the story. I've wanted to read the book for years, and finally did it. I'm very glad I did--it was such a joy to read, and I loved the soft, sweet descriptions and the incredibly poignant presentation of human nature when viewed from the point of vie"
3457,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"There is something magical and very special about The Last Unicorn penned by Peter S. Beagle, from the world creation to the rich characters to the lessons deftly woven within. I was recently gifted this audio version by a friend, in which prolific author Mr. Beagle himself narrates his host of characters including of the Unicorn, Schmendrick, Molly Grue, Mommy Fortuna, and the Red Bull of King Haggard. The Unicorn's journey of discovery changes not only each character, but the world wander in."
3458,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"Now this is the type of adventure book I want to read. Let's take a nice trip down memory lane, shall we? 13 year old Nana is walking around Walmart with her lil' sis and dad. When they reach the DVD section her dad says: ""You and your sister can pick out one movie each."" To summarize their reactions: Nana's sister walked towards the action films while Nana walked to the Barbie section. There she saw a misplaced DVD that shined blue amongst all the pink: The Last Unicorn. Immediately after reading"
3460,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,3,"This was a fun, well written book. I think I struggled to know what genre the author was going for. It started out feeling like a more serious fantasy type. As it went on it almost felt like it was making fun of the ""fairytale/fantasy genre."" It reminded me of ""The Princess Bride"" a bit in that. Although not nearly as good. It fell a little flat when they got to the castle and the love story seemed contrived to me. The character of the unicorn seemed a little one dimensional. I did enjoy Molly a"
3461,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"This is one of the most beautiful books I've read. Every sentence, every paragraph is so poetically beautiful it fills you with an urge to stop; to savor it, admire it, and reflect it upon it. This is my most highlighted book, I think it's fitting to share my favorite: “When you are old, anything that does not disturb you is a comfort. Cold and darkness and boredom long ago lost their sharp edges for us, but warmth, singing, spring—no, they would all be disturbances.” “You deserve the services of a"
3462,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"I loved the movie, only recently discovered it is a book. Love it!"
3463,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"A lovely tale. I thoroughly enjoyed this adventure. All of the characters spoke to me in some way, and it is beautifully written."
3464,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"Bloody magnificent fantasy, more than fit to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with LotR and Narnia."
3465,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,An amazing book! Please see my review on my blog! http://thesoulwanderers.blogspot.ca/2...
3466,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"I remember watching this movie so much as a child that I ruined the VHS tape. Never knew it was based off of a book, so when I saw it at a bookstore I knew I had to have it and read it. It was like watching the movie as I was reading, the scenes came to life. In some parts, it was so lyrical, that you couldn't help but sing the words. This will always be the one thing that will remind me of my childhood, innocence, and belief in fairy tales."
3467,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"Wow. WOW. I had no idea. My head is spinning a little. I'm trying to restrain myself from gushing with superlatives here, and failing. Best book I've read for the first time in the past year. Best modern fairy tale I've ever read. One of the best fantasy books I've read, period. I was of course already very familiar with the 1980s animated film version of this book, and have loved it since I was a kid (in spite of the cheesy America soundtrack). I'd been meaning to read the book for decades, and w"
3468,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"The Last Unicorn is one of those books which I kept hearing great things about over the years, but never got around to reading. I’m not sure why. Maybe it was the title that didn’t quite appeal, or perhaps it was the various covers I’d seen which put me off. I don’t know. It just didn’t call out to me in a loud enough voice. It turns out this was my loss as The Last Unicorn is a fabulous story. So, what made me read it after all this time? Well, I started reading a copy of Peter S. Beagle’s lates"
3469,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"I LOVE The Last Unicorn !! While it's not technically a young adult novel but more of a children's fantasy, it can be enjoyed at all ages, as I've just finished it for the first time and completely fell in love with it. It's a whimsical, hopeful, fantasy classic! I watched the movie ages ago and have had the book sitting on my shelf for a while. It's a quick and gripping read, the story of a unicorn who begins a journey to find more of her kind. The humans in the world have become so hopeless and"
3470,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"The Last Unicorn by Peter S. Beagle is another one of the iconic tales that shaped my childhood. Of course, my first encounter with the wild and rare unicorn was through the animated movie, but I soon found the book and the moment I opened its pages I was done for. The writing is elegant, descriptive, and profound without being dense or heavy-handed. The narrative flows smoothly. What I find particularly compelling is that many of the characters are presented to us as hollow (or incomplete) arch"
3471,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"This is certainly one of the more beautifully written books I have ever read. Coming into this story having only known it as a (slightly racy) children’s movie, I expected it to be a fair bit more childish. I definitely wasn’t ready for the gorgeous prose I encountered here, prose which invited a slower and more contemplative second reading of nearly every other sentence in an effort to parse out the secondary meanings from Beagle’s sometimes confusingly beautiful similes. For any lover of good"
3472,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,"I had a hard time rating this book. I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars. It was good (3 or 4 stars), but didn't quite live up to my expectations (4 or 5 stars). So, 3.75. Anyway, I had a hard time getting into the book. The writing was very lyrical, like all the reviews say, but maybe too lyrical for me. I need story. But things started happening and characters were introduced and I started liking it more and more until finally it was hard to put down. I guess the only thing I didn't like about the boo"
3473,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"I was ten or so when I saw the animated movie ""the Last Unicorn"" the first time. I have seen it dozens and dozens of time since then and I never really thought there was a book behind it. When I first realized this was the case, a year or so ago, I figured I knew the story, so why bother. Oh how mistaken I was! I'm glad to have read it - the language is extra-ordinarily metaphor laden and there are details that did not appear in the book. It's the most beautiful prose I have ever read. The story"
3474,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"This was a fantastic book. I'm surprised I never read it until now. I look forward to reading it again in the future, and hopefully aloud, as I think it will work really well for that. One of the things that was interesting about reading it was that I had just come off a Stephen King book that was so verbose that I was skimming everything. This book was the complete opposite. So much could change about the world and story within single sentence that I had to constantly slow myself down, take note"
3475,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"I read this under several objections, most them having to do with how ridiculous the title and the cover look, especially if you are over thirty carrying it around. But author after author I love kept talking about Peter S. Beagle and The Last Unicorn. They didn't suggest reading it, they just assumed that all the writers and readers in the room had, the same way they assume that everyone has read LOTR. So I read it and I can't understand how Peter S. Beagle did it. How he can make us all be th"
3476,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,"First off, can I just say that this is probably the most beautifully written children's book I have ever read? It even puts other classics to shame--Compared to ""the Last Unicorn"", Narnia reads like the scrawlings on a men's bathroom stall. Unlike a lot of people, I never read the book/watched the movie as a child, so I didn't have to contend with my childhood impression of the story. I must say, it was kind of nice to read it with an adult's eyes, because there were a lot of deep truths woven in"
3478,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"A short, sweet and bittersweet fantasy about unicorns and wizards, enchantments, monsters and heroes. Beagle has gentle fun with this fairy-tale quest, winking and teasing his readers with soft ironies intermixed with a lullaby of a story. It doesn't take long to read this classic, and I can strongly recommend it to anyone susceptible to an innocent archetypal myth. •     •     •     •     •     •     •     • P.S., from the New Yorker:"
3479,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"The opening paragraph is so delicately beautiful, ""The unicorn lived in a lilac wood, and she lived all alone. She was very old, though she did not know it, and she was no longer the careless color of sea foam, but rather the colour of snow falling on a moonlit night. But her eyes were still clear and unwearied, and she still moved like a shadow on the sea."" This book is like finding a little gleaming seashell at the beach that you tuck into your pocket to take home with you & you keep it on"
3480,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,2,"I still want to see the movie again, because it made me cry my eyes out when i was little, but goddam did i just not get the book. I don't understand what the anachronisms are for, I don't get the king lear allusion, I don't get whether I'm supposed to care about Lir, I love all the female characters (both, maybe I can count a third) but ultimately they're pretty transparent props, and I feel like the message about violence is pretty fuckin ambivalent. Also the writing felt turgid. But whatever,"
3481,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,2,"Well, hmmm. What the heck is wrong with me? Everyone just loves this book so much - I'm relieved to see my buddy Sarah only gave it 2 stars as well. I just could not get into this! I gave it 50 pages, that should be enough. Maybe it was the wrong timing? I need to take a break from fantasy? I ended up returning it to the library well before the due date but because this is such a favorite I had remorse and put it on hold again - maybe after I'm done with my current books I'll give it another try"
3482,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"This is such a sweet, lovely book. By turns poignant and wistful and utterly silly, The Last Unicorn says a lot more about life and love and beauty than you might suspect from just reading the book's summary. And for anyone who believes that ""deconstructing"" fantasy tropes is some sort of new fad, just check out this 43-year old subversive tale and you'll learn something wonderful and new. If you have a chance, listen to the audio of this book. It's narrated by Peter Beagle himself, and he makes"
3483,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"One of the most beautiful stories I have ever read in my life. I read it as a child and it has stayed with me ever since. There's a certain melancholy sweetness about it that touches your soul, its lyrical prose just floats off the page like the softest down, it's like having a dream about a poem you once heard many years ago. I'm such a fan of this book that I even have a signed deluxe copy (including the coda, Two Hearts) by the man himself! Soppy, I know, but it's one of the rare few books that"
3484,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,"It seems that most young children believe in unicorns at some point, as did I many years ago. This wonderful fairytale, written in 1968 -- which reminded me a lot of Princess Bride with its humor, unlikely romances, bumbling characters, magic spells, evil King and monsters, and a story that appeals to all ages -- tells of the quest that the last apparent unicorn embarks on, accompanied by an inept magician and an old woman, to find her lost fellows. The writing is lyrical and witty, the characte"
3485,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,"So if you're like me and grew up with the cartoon, you'd probably enjoy the book as well. It was mostly the same with only a couple differences. I feel like the movie was a bit better though. Only because in places I thought the writing felt a little slow and dry but that could only be my nostalgia glossing over the cartoon version. In any case it was still a lovely book and I enjoyed reading it."
3486,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,2,"You know, I really loved the Japanimation movie made from this story when I was little, but I didn't find reading this book to be all that gratifying of an experience. It took way longer than it should have for such a thin novel - I even quit reading before bed for over a week to avoid this one. While lyrical, some of the prose was hard to follow, and I did NOT enjoy all the strange songs randomly put in here and there. Just an ok book, sort of disappointing."
3487,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"This story was read aloud to me by a dear friend as we drove through the mountains of Colorado, which is perhaps the most ideal way to experience this novel. The prose is fantastic, the characters complex and endearing, the story punctuated with insight into humanity. Everything that makes a children's story wonderful."
3488,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"It was such an unusual tale... I can't sort out my feelings. I would give it a 3.8 because of the confusing beginning and underwhelming ending. But everything else was great... strange and beautiful. I would recommend it to everyone, everywhere. Dare not put it in children's or fantasy shelf..."
3489,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"It's been nearly twenty years since I last read this, but still every page felt familiar as breathing, and anyone who doesn't agree that this is one of the greatest fantasy novels of all time can fight me. :)"
3490,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,***4.5 STARS*** World Building: A Mythology: A Plot-Twists: A Villains: A- Suspense: A Feels: A For you clean-readers: this book does NOT have mature content.
3491,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,I saw the animated film when I was younger and have wanted to read the book for a long time. It had the classic fairytale vibe to it and I hope to find some inspiration for my own fantasy novel.
3492,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,1,I read a review somewhere comparing this book to Tolkien. Unbelievable! This is one of the least compelling books I've ever read.
3493,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,Reading the word 'Unicorn' every five seconds + listening to metal is like some strange aphrodisiac for my twisted soul. Uni-Porn. LoveloveloveughugughuuhuuurKFJHGLDKJRHLDHJKRHG ♡-♡
3494,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,"Read for the 2018 PopSugar reading challenge. This is ""A childhood classic you've never read."" ...although after reading it, I'm surprised it's such a childhood book for so many people, because this thing is kind of bleak! The idea of the last anything is inherently a bit sad and tragic; add to that a magician who is incapable of reliably doing any magic (and is treated like some kind of carnival sleight-of-hand sideshow) as well as a middle-aged woman who dreamed of a unicorn's miracles in her y"
3495,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,3,"I come to short books generally near the end of the year when I realize that I'm way behind on my reading goal and I don't feel like tackling an epic fantasy series where each installment has 600+ pages. I had seen The Last Unicorn in a bookstore a while ago and it intrigued me. Patrick Rothfuss called it the best book he's ever read. Ursula K. Le Guin praised it as well. So, I decided to give it a shot. The Last Unicorn reads very much like a fairytale. The prose is unlike anything I've ever re"
3496,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,"I saw the movie as a child and was convinced that the writing of the original book is the real hero, so I decided to give the book a try. I should have read this earlier and ignored my thoughts that watching the movie first would ruin the book. The Last Unicorn is elegantly written flowing both beautifully and poetically. The metaphors and descriptors are pretty out of this world making it read like a true fairytale. Overall, the story is just lovely - The imagery is magical. ""The unicorn lived in"
3498,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,1,"What a shame. I thought I would like this book, but I guess this is a classic case of it's not you, it's me. An interesting enough storyline, but the silliness of the characters trumped and affection I had towards the book in general. The characters weren't real enough for me. The wizard(I forgot his name, it was way too long), Mary Grue, and Prince Lír felt like something out of a kid's cartoon: adorable with their inane and fatuous actions, but at the end of the day, still flat. Everything we"
3499,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,"This is the book I expected when reading Nobel Prize winner Kazuo Ishiguro's The Buried Giant. Peter S. Beagle wrote a classic post-modern novel up-ending fairy tales and fantasy tropes and expectations, while somehow remaining true to the form. The prose is flowery in places, but it doesn't disturb, as it enhances the dream-fairytale-like quality of the novel. The characters are thin fairy tale characters, but Beagle twists them and adds just enough depth to keep the fairy tale quality and inte"
3501,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"Recently I was thinking about music that I like, and I determined that often the stuff that I love the most is that which successfully pulls off being bittersweet and/or whimsical...so I guess it's no surprise that I like books that are in the same vein. I loved all of the characters in this and the adventure that they went on. The character development for certain characters was also amazing, as were the bonds that were formed. I whole heartedly recommend this to anyone who likes fairy tales, f"
3502,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,"Beagle is at his best in the beginning of this book in my opinion. Before things get dark and droll, he has a witty sense of humor that is full of fun and original non sequiturs. As the novel progresses though, he gets a bit too glum and dull in the castle when the Unicorn becomes human and the Prince is doing is schtick. When Beagle is at his best is when he's turning things on their head at the beginning and end of this book. It's definitely well worth reading, just be prepared to have to push"
3504,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,2,"I think this was a ""whoosh"" situation because I cannot understand why this book has such great reviews. I had no idea what was happening ever. I know it was written in the 60s or whatever so I should be able to give it some grace but I was largely just bored and confused, the actual opposite of how a fantasy book should be. On a side note, is this book how Red Bull got it's name? That's cool. 2.5 stars."
3505,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"This book was published in 1968, the same year that I was born. I can hardly believe that I hadn’t read this book until we were both fifty years old. It’s delightful. You’ll want all of your friends and family to read it. Anyone who loves traditional fairy tales will appreciate this novel’s sensibilities and will hopefully appreciate its modern romance. I now see so much of its influence in contemporary writers like Naomi Novik."
3506,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,A lovely classic. What more to add but it has influenced a generation of writers and readers.
3508,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,This book just is perfection. Nothing more to say ❤. ***This book was read as part of my 2018 O.W.L.s in the subject 'Care of Magical Creatures' (read a book about a magical creature OR with a magical creature on the cover)***
3509,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,"A great mix of fantasy elements, tragedy and a wonderful sense of humor. Though the book is not a particularly long read it did not seem as if anything is missing. Beagle seems to know perfectly well how much time to spend on anything. Every small side character is written in an interesting way and worth remembering. The protagonists have a good dynamic and every dialog or deed seems relevant for their arcs. If I had ro nitpick a little I would say that experiencing the unicorn forgetting over t"
3510,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"Can't wait to read this again and underline passages. Peter Beagle doesn't have just a gift with words, but a magic wand. I'm floored by how beautiful this was."
3512,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"I loved the animated version of The Last Unicorn when I was a kid. All of the films from that studio fascinated me. They also did The Flight of Dragons (my favourite) and the most frightening version of The Hobbit you'll ever watch. They were all a bit eerie and off-putting, as the motion, the character designs, and the adult voices always felt a bit wrong to me as a kid. That was part of what made them different and interesting, though. I'm not sure how I didn't know this, but it wasn't until a"
3513,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"Beautiful! Part of me wishes I had read this as a child, but I also enjoyed reading it as an adult and tripping back into the sheer wonder of it (while also being able to appreciate the larger metaphors). Lovely writing with so many truly unique turns of phrase, but it never felt too precious for the story. So wonderful."
3514,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,"I've never seen the cartoon, but now I'll definitely have to. I've never been a fan of unicorns, but I have to say, this was a pretty great book. ^^"
3515,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,1,"Dropping at 26% because it's not engaging me. I'm curious about how it will end, and I put off watching the movie for YEARS in order to read this, but the journey doesn't seem worth the destination."
3516,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,The Last Unicorn is one of those tales that is so finely written it makes me wonder if there is any writing left to be done.
3517,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,The Last Unicorn is an amazing fairy tale I think everyone should read. Peter S. Beagle has a great imagination and a wonderful writing style that grabs you right from the start. I'm looking forward to reading more of this Authors work. I give The Last Unicorn 5 stars for its imaginative fairy tale. I would recommend this book to everyone.
3518,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"perplexing, unquestionable, but always true. Ends in the best way possible."
3519,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"Luminous and beautifully written - I can't think of another fantasy novel quite like it. First off I struggled as I couldn't really find a strong sense of pace, but realise now that like a medieval ballad crossed with a fairy tale, this is a part of the story's uniqueness."
3520,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,3,"I came into this book with a high feeling of excitement and anticipation. For some reason, it was one of those books that I'd always heard great things about and intended to read but had never gotten around to. People love The Last Unicorn, both the film and the book, and I truly thought that it would be something that I too would enjoy and maybe even love. But I was wrong. Try as I might, I just couldn't get into this book. I found it to be weird and way to hopped up on the flower power of the"
3521,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,"I read Peter S. Beagle 's The Last Unicorn in my freshman seminar, and I have no idea what happened to my print copy. But I got an ebook version in a Humble Bundle a couple of years ago, so recently, I read it again. The Last Unicorn is both a fairy tale and sort of a send-up of fairy tales; it's got a lot of flowery atmospheric language that doesn't always make concrete sense, and also a lot of jokes and anachronisms and funny names. I remember not really getting it when I first read it; I may"
3522,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"I read this book several summers ago and found it amazing. Maybe it was the cartoon that made me want to read it, I don't know. But one thing I do know is that this was an excellent read. Our book starts off with a unicorn who is alone in a forest. She then begins to wonder if she is the last of the unicorns and goes on a journey in search for them. On the journey she meets two people: Schemdrick (hope I spelled that right) the Magician and Molly These two people decide to help the Unicorn in her s"

3525,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"I stand by my original review but want to add two things: 1) it's super aggravating to me as an adult how often men talk over Molly Grue 2) ""a tall, thin man with an air of resolute bewilderment"" is the best character intro ever My book reviews lately seem to fall in two camps: ""this book is silly and stupid"" or ""this book is the second coming of Christ"". The Last Unicorn is even more than that, though. The Last Unicorn is transcendent. It is genre-making and genre-destroying. It is the alpha and"
3526,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,"I have always wanted to read this novel since seeing the animated Rankin/Bass production from the early 1980s (author Peter S. Beagle adapted his novel into the screenplay). I thoroughly enjoyed revisiting the story of the last unicorn who goes in search of her missing folk. She gets the two best friends anybody can have: Schmendrick the ageless wizard and Molly the cook for a band of outlaws. I love the variety of characters and their personalities and types, but only wish that there were more c"
3528,The Last Unicorn,Peter S.

""RIGHT??"" says the other.) But when someone taught me the trick of squinting and looking at it through the pinhole of my curled palm, it turned into blue and black before my very eyes, and at that moment I was convinced I was magic.

3530,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"This book was so beautiful I wanted to hug it (in fact, I may have). I looooved The Last Unicorn movie as a kid and watched it repeatedly, but I’m ashamed to say until recently I didn’t even realise it was a book. I ordered it as soon as I discovered it was, and finally got around to reading it this week. From the opening lines (“The unicorn lived in a lilac wood, and she lived all alone... she was no longer the careless color of sea foam, but rather the color of snow falling on a moonlit night.”"
3531,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"The Last Unicorn is one of my all-time favorite childhood movies, but I didn't know until recently that it was based on a wonderful book by Peter S. Beagle. Full of mythical creatures and magicians, The Last Unicorn is a complex and enchanting fantasy story that wraps the reader up in it's timeless magic. The novel begins in the lilac wood of the unicorn, as she listens in to two hunters arguing over the existence of unicorns in the world. After realizing that she had not seen another unicorn in"
3532,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"I was introduced to The Last Unicorn through a grainy VHS tape borrowed from my grandparents. My sister and I watched it way too much! Many more years later than I care to admit to, I discovered that this story that had embedded itself in my childhood was based on a novel. I immediately picked up the book version and got lost in the same fairy-tale world. Only this time, I found a story even deeper and more touching than I remembered. The Last Unicorn is about a unicorn who has lived long withou"
3533,The Last Unicorn,Peter S.

Congratulations Goodreads for your synopses, you’re that villain with no heart that I thought only existed on children’s books and on some archetypical epic fantasy series. I’m glad that the synopsis on the physical book was different and that nevertheless I didn’t read it,"
3534,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"The Last Unicorn despite its very short page count is one of those books I would consider as literary genius. First of all, there is an absolutely magical almost breath taking quality to Peter S Beagle's writing, the way he writes is poetry in motion. And because it was meant to be a short story, the writing is absolutely razor sharp. Vivid, imaginative and even whimsical at times nothing feels wasted as the paragraphs flow so beautifully from one to the other. The unicorn lived in a lilac wood,"
3535,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,"First of all I want to say upfront that this genre isn't really my thing. I've been racking my brains for a while about why this kind of fairytale-esque fantasy doesn't appeal to me, and I think, ultimately, it comes down to the fact that it doesn't feel real. I couldn't believe that the characters were real people - they seemed somehow cold and distant, and their personalities fluctuated in strange ways that made it hard to get a sense of who they really were - or that the events of the story a"
3537,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"I am ashamed that I haven't read this before. I was a great devotee of the movie when I was young and it wasn't until I was a teen that I even realized there WAS a book. But even then, I remember checking it out once and trying it, but just preferring the movie. Silly girl. The book is just as good and definitely more profound. Or, maybe, I have just lived enough now to see that it IS profound. The last unicorn doesn't know she is the last until she hears a hunter speak the words. Her journey to"
3538,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"Why does it seem that some of the best literature is categorized as chldren's literature? I've read Hemingway, Joyce, Dickens, and a host of others, but I've never felt as satisfied with most of them as I do after completing ""children's literature."" First, if you have ever seen the animated movie based on this book, you've only seen half the story. I did see the movie back when it first came out in a theatre (yes, I am that old) and very much loved it. But the book has so much more. A movie is, n"
3539,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"I watched this as a child; it was the first movie to make me cry. Thirty five years old and I still can't watch the movie without welling up. So, I figured it was about time I read the book, and oh...the book is even more delightful for all its tragic beauty. The prose is gorgeous; the imagery spellbinding. We follow the story of an immortal unicorn who discovers she may be the last of her kind. She must leave her forest and go in search of the other unicorns, or else she will never be at peace."
3540,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"The Last Unicorn is one of the rare novels that I've come to love, and it is one of the rare occasions that I have come to love both the book and the movie adaption. I've had this book on my shelf collecting dust for many years before I rekindled my adoration for the film and finally deciding to pick this up and read, to find the similarities and differences: While the film adaptation that some may be very familiar with is both beautiful and enchanting, I've also found the book to be just as so. T"
3541,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"This book. OMG THIS BOOK. It remains one of my all time favorites. Two things resonated the most with me, identifying why this book is considered a classic: 1) When Molly, furious, yells ""Where were you when I needed you?"" at the unicorn. It wasn't just about being rescued, but how Molly needed to believe in magic as a young girl, but none ever appeared to her. So she grew up jaded and bitter and hurting. And when the magic (i.e., the unicorn) finally shows up, Molly is angry that it's come too la"
3542,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,"The Last Unicorn is a cross between bittersweet fairy tale and a self-aware postmodern story. It deals with love and loss, real and make-believe, forgetting oneself and remembering who you are. It is one of those rare books that can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their age or gender. Peter Beagle has a way with words; he manages to paint a vivid picture without a complex vocabulary. I wish I hadn’t been turned off by the title when I was younger as I’m sure it would have become one of my fav"
3543,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,3,"3.5 Is my actual score This is my second time reading this book. The first time I went through it on audio about a year ago. and it was pretty awful. The narrator (the author himself) was monotone and uninspired. I found it extremely hard to focus. Now going back and reading it I can see why. Not only did the author do a bad job at narrating, but the prose of the book is very unique; I'd say old school even, just like a fairy tale. That's exactly what this book is too. A fairy tale. And a good on"
3544,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"I actually finished reading The Last Unicorn a month ago, but it took me this long to stop weeping enough that I could see to type. Peter S. Beagle's classic tale of a unicorn who leaves her home to discover what's become of the rest of her kind is filled to the brim with songs and stories, magic and mysteries, harpers and harpies, enchanted clocks and talking skulls, and all the love and loss that make life so goddamned beautiful and heartbreaking. And then, just when you think you may never rec"
3545,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,3,"For a long time, I thought I'd read this book, and just hadn't loved it. Then I read something else by Beagle, loved it - and realized that I'd been confusing 'The Last Unicorn' with Mark Helprin's 'Winter's Tale,' based solely on the cover art. So, I was rather excited to FINALLY read this. Unfortunately, I didn't love this book either. It was OK. But 'one of the great classics of fantasy'? Hmm. It's really more of a book about fantasy then it is a fantasy. It's too meta- for me. Too much allegor"
3546,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"Written with gentle wit and a deceptively straightforward presentation, The Last Unicorn creates a complex and completely believable world that combines familiar fairy tale mythologies with a contemporary shrewdness that somehow manages to avoid being too clever, too garrulous, or too slyly modern for its own good – something no other fantasy novel, however well known, seems to have accomplished. As a result, The Last Unicorn is unlike any fantasy novel that I’ve read, and the supplemental story"
3547,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"I am not particularly fond of unicorns, yet I am very fond of this book. The story itself is not especially complicated, nor is the book especially long. On the contrary, it's actually quite a short tale. What truly sets this story apart is the prose. Beagle writes with wonderful authority and great confidence, bordering on poetry. The entire book may be read in one short sitting not simply because it is short but also because it is so easy to read. There is also an almost heartbreaking honesty a"
3548,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,2,"The Last Unicorn is one of those books that, at some point during the reading, I realize that there's a lot of symbolism/metaphor stuff going on, and I'm not really getting it. Those kinds of books are always slightly disappointing to me; I'd rather have a story - especially a fantasy like this one - work on multiple levels where repeated readings reveal the symbolism rather than having it be so obvious at first. In any case, the story follows the titular Unicorn as she searches the land for the"
3549,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,1,"I tried to have an open mind about the imaginative nature of The Last Unicorn , but I almost felt my creativity being stunted as I read it. I found the character development weak and the plot boring and random. Having not experienced this story as a child, I had no choice but to approach it as an adult - with logic/reason. (Forgive me; I don't believe in unicorns.) As a result, I was secretly hoping the mission to save the last unicorn would fail - sending a message that boys wielding wands with"

This is one of those books. Yes, it is. For me, it's a high fantasy story which I found anything but boring or aimless, as I tend to do with high fantasies. But it's a lot more than that, and that's probably better understood by reading for yourself. I found the Red Bull terrif"
3552,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"Wow. How did I miss this one? I think that I thought it was that book about unicorns by Mark Helprin [edit: A WINTER'S TALE], which I read as a teenager and didn't really like. This one is much better. It reminded me of THE ONCE AND FUTURE KING in its blending of classical fantasy and modern allusions. It seemed like a children's book at first, but it's really not. More like a fairy tale for adults, which is not to say young people couldn't or shouldn't read it. Beagle is a marvelous writer. He ma"
3553,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,2,"I read this in an omnibus of Beagle's work, The Fantasy Worlds of Peter S. Beagle . I did enjoy it... But I didn't love it. I think it's just one of those books you have to fall in love with when you're young. If I had read it as a kid, it would have been magical. As an adult? Not so much. It was a well written and entertaining read though, so I'm going with two stars, ""it was ok""."
3555,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,1,"This has got to be one of the worst books I have EVER read. Mainly since nothing really happens. They go on this journey for half the novel and then they find this castle and we meet these random characters who have nothing to do with the ones we met at the beginning. The plot is a little episodic and I didn't like that. I found Beagle's style very boring as well. I'm all for detailed writing, I advocate for detailed writing, but I hated the way it was written. I'm not eactly sure what it was abo"
3556,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,"Somehow, I never read this as a kid and so I was excited when my online book club selected it. This is the kind of book that really should be read aloud. The language is gorgeous and slyly funny---I'm not sure if kids would really appreciate all of it, but it would help the adult reading it along (chapters are about 20 pages in length, so maybe a tad on the long-ish side for a nighttime readalong? I don't know how this works.) It's smart and funny and honestly broke my heart a bit. Recommended. ("
3557,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,"A strange book certainly, but beautiful. The writing is quite ethereal, heavy at times, and meant to be spoken aloud with love. I'm a little surprised this is achildren's book, there are some really hard and adult concepts to grasp, and while they are good lessons for children, they are wrapped in carefully guarded and subtle words. Still a little something both adults and children to enjoy, and maybe the children will understand it with more clarity. (view spoiler) [ I almost wished for a happie"
3558,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"I've always loved the movie, and now finally managed to get the book too. While the movie is a very faithful adaptation of the book in terms both of style and plot, there's just a bit ""more"" to the book. It's maybe the most melancholic piece of literature I've ever read, in a good way though, although it just kinda makes you want to get a hug after you're done. (And that although the ending is actually quite happy...) Loved it. One classic well worth the label!"
3559,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,"This is a charming tale. In many ways it is about what it is to be in a fairy tale, with many of the characters being aware of their roles. In other ways it is a pastiche, with odd references to the modern world such as bottle-tops, magazines and tacos. For me the parts were better than the whole, but the whole left me with a warm feeling. I am not sure I can say any more than that. Give it a shot."
3560,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,3,"I remember the animated movie from my childhood. While I couldn't remember much of the story, I could remember the wonder and awe that I had after seeing it. I didn't feel that way about the book. It was an interesting fantasy tale, but I didn't really care for any of the characters and wasn't particularly moved. It was a good read, but one I will most likely forget quickly. Maybe I'll rent the movie again and see if that changes my mind."
3561,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,2,"It is an odd book. Sometimes it seemed like a mixture of A Night in the Lonesome October, Book of the New Sun and Lord of Light. It was illogical. The story line was confusing. You could not believe the narrators. They either lied or spoke in riddles. The language and narration were old fashioned. I did like the unicorn though. 4 out of 10 Finishing the book coincided with visiting Stirling castle where unicorn in the dominating thing on all tapestries. Coincidence?"
3562,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,"I love this book. It is my chicken soup book. When I'm down I turn to this book. It is the story of a Unicorn on the search to find out if she is truly the last one. Along the way she picks up a wizard and Molly. What is great about this book it is not about second chances but, that important third or fourth chance you might really need. It has one of the best ending I have ever read. Ever word perfectly choosen."
3563,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,"I fought against this book. I knew there was no way I would be pleased with the direction it took. All the foreshadowing about destiny. It was too melancholy. I wanted to put it down before it was too late for me to shrug it off.The unicorn should never have left her safe home in the woods. No, don't go out into the world, I begged her. Nothing good would come of it. And yet, the author was able to leave me with a feeling of hope. And that will have to be enough."

I received an ARC of Green Rider from the publisher when it first came out, asking if I could blurb it. I set it on the corner of my desk. My younger daughter had recently run out of Tamora Pierce books. She asked if she could try Green Rider and I said, ""Sure, let me know what you think of it, and then I'll read it.""

3569,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,"I’ve had this series on my shelves for YEARS. It was one of the few I was incredibly excited to start, which makes it all the more disappointing that I didn’t like it. My 2-star “it was just okay” rating sums it up perfectly: it was just okay.

At one point, I was more than halfway through the book and still couldn’t se"

This one didn't. *sigh* The overall story also suffers from a common problem in fantasy world-building: TOO MUCH. If magic horses and riders aren't enough for the tired old the-throne-is-threatened-oh-no-must-save-it! trope, add bad elves, ancient magics, rich men who mysteriously fall for the heroine, shadowy bad guys, Disney-esque old ladies in isolated magical mansions"

The references to The Lord of the Rings, and even Star Wars are prevalent, but that in itself doesn’t really bother me. There are many successful novels out there that owe allegiance to the classics of fantasy (Harry Potter, anyone?).

I only decide to read it due to the recommendations of friends, and I am glad that I did. In a way, I guess that I wasn't wrong about the old school feeling, as this is a very classic fantasy story and gave off a Tolkienesque vibe. So, classic fantasy - you know what to expect then.

3575,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"So, I really feel like The Green Rider demonstrates what a fantasy novel should really be. Just enough world building to pique the interest, with a lot of the usual fantasy tropes bobbing to the surface (ancient wars, forgotten magic, elite bodyguards, aloof faeries/elves hidden in the forests, etc) but other details that make it uniquely its own. The world building is not so overwhelming that is swamps the action or waters down the characters too much. The pacing kept quick and exciting, as Ka"

Back in 1998 when this book was first published, I'm sure it seemed like a great marketing decision. Now maybe not so much. In the first half of the book, Karigan, the protagonist, is really irritating. Granted, she's a teenager and it's established that she's something of a rebel, and I imagine that if most of us were thrown into a fantasy adventure, we'd probably complain t"

As she swears to deliver the message, h"
3585,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,An excellent page-turning series starter. It's essentially non-stop action from beginning to end. A perfect book for folks new to Fantasy or old hands like myself. At times it strays towards cheesy but rights itself quickly. It's a more than less self-contained stand alone with a few over-arching dangling plot threads to lead into the next novel. A terrific cast of characters that I look forward to reading again. I would highly recommend it to all of my Fantasy reading friends.
3586,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,"I've read this book so many times, my copy is starting to come apart. I absolutely LOVE it. The main character Karigan is so believable, I can relate easily to her, and I know that most people would feel the same. The story is very original and engaging. It's definitely a must read for any fantasy book fan."
3587,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,"Most of my commentary on this book, actually, has to do with its similarities to Mercedes Lackey's Heralds of Valdemar- after all, that was the reason I picked it up. But since other reviewers have addressed it, I'll just summarize it like so: Easy to see the parallels, and at the time it seems almost derivative. However, there are distinct differences.

Too many details were poorly done, obviously for the convenience of the story. (Her wrists are burned but not her hands, clothes, or any other part?) The dialogue was awful & the characterization childish."
3591,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,"I usually like adventure fantasies, but this book was just all over the damn place. There are plenty of books in which this is well done, I didn't feel like this was one of them. The adventures felt forced, and I didn't enjoy reading any of them. I finished the book, but I skimmed through most of it because I just wanted to know what happened in the end. I kind of want to read the subsequent novels, but this is not a good start."

It reminded me of Tamora Pierce's novels actually: the heroine is a strong female called to do some great deed, there's a sprig of romance (not a main theme but it's not minor either), has the perfect blend of fantasy and adventure and keeps its readers turning the pages. All in all, it was wonderful."

3602,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"it may contain the elements of your typical fantasy/adventure story but i think we can all commend kristen britain for doing it the right way. i love our spunky main character, the horse, and the people she met along the road. so many things happened, it's actually quite a long book but surprisingly, i flew through it. how i wish that i had read this during my early teenage years. i really enjoyed this."
3604,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"The first impression one gets from reading the back cover of Green Rider is the obvious parallels to the Heralds of Valdemar series by Mercedes Lackey. Both involve messengers of the regent, special horses, and magic. And while there are some similarities, Britain's book reads with less magic and more grit and politics. The world is rougher, more dangerous; the land of the story is broken into clans, much as Europe was broken into multiple kingdoms, fiefdoms, etc. several centuries ago; clans wh"
3605,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"EXPECT SPOILERS The beauty of this book--at least for me--is that I am still newly venturing into the world of fantasy. So, the novel was original, the magical world was quite intriguing, and the bad guys weren't completely expected. Karigan is a lovable character. I wanted her to succeed. And since I know this book is just one in a series of at least 4 books, I know, in the back of my mind, that she will succeed. F'ryan Coblebay. Man, I really like this character. Does it say something about me"
3606,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,"Holy book lords does this woman need an editor. I bought the audiobook version of this novel and immediately questioned why I'd liked it so much on the first reading. Other reviewers are right in saying that the book very much resembles Mercedes Lackey's Valdemar series, since the basic premise is the same--magical horse connects with rider who is bound to it-- but there is more death and gloom and nonsensical plot devices here. Nevertheless, some of the culture of the riders was appealing and i"
3607,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,"3.5 stars, rounded down to 3. The vibe I get from this book is very similar to the one I get when reading The Hobbit. It's a light-hearted whimsical tale and a fun read. I love the main character's bond with her horse, as it is very similar to the bond a rider has with her horse in the real world. Britain really captures the trust and love that exist between a girl and her horse. I would have given this book a higher rating, but I'm not sure if this book is for everyone even though I enjoyed it"
3608,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,I bought this book during a stay in London in 2007. The blurb was like an invitation to me. I like books with a heroine. And to be honest I really love Karrigan and her story. I also like the authors writing style. Fortunately there are two more books. Second volume is on my to read list and third volume is on my to buy list. It's really interesting that UK and US pocket books are a lot cheaper when I buy them in Germany. Ok maybe one reason is exchange raate of Euro.
3609,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"I really enjoyed this book. My only issue was that the pacing in the early chapters was off and made the book sag. But once she reaches the city and delivers her message (about 40% through the book), the plot doesn't stop to take a breath."
3610,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,Will review upon a re-read.
3611,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,"I didn’t know where the book was going to go. By the cover I thought she would be getting with the character who turned out to be the Gray Rider! Whoops.. Then I thought she would get with the Green Rider, even though he died, I thought they would get together. He was a few years older than her so I thought that was such a shame, and I didn’t like that he was sending a love letter to Lady Estora and planning to get married. His name is F’ryan Coblebay and I really didn’t like it. It was a dying"
3612,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,"Well, all I can say is that I'm glad I read this from the library and didn't buy it myself. To be honest, this one was a case of blatant cover love - I skimmed the synopsis and just dived right into this one hoping it would be good. It started off okay, but we kind of went down hill as the story progressed. It turns out this was really not for me. It might be for those who like heavy, dense fantasy. It isn't that I don't like heavy fantasy, but this had no emotional depth in it, and if I'm goi"
3613,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"Why I chose this book I wanted to read some classic fantasy this year, and several of my friends said they enjoyed this one. Rating/content I give this book 4 out of 5 stars. This book is not exactly young adult, but the main protagonist is a teenage girl. She reluctantly takes over the mission of a Green Rider (messenger to the king), and the first half of the book follows a fairly traditional fantasy quest progression. The second half of the book is basically about overcoming the bad guy’s plans t"
3615,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,"I'm going to try this again in a few years, but for now the plot seems too childish to me, aspiring so hard to be LOTR and failing even harder. This girl managed to get captured like 4 times during the first 25 percent of the book, and every time she is magically saved by yet another Deux Ex Machina. I heard there is a great slow burn in those books but judging by what transpired until now, I'm not convinced it will be done right at all."
3616,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"Actual Rating 3.5 I enjoyed this book I think it just fell short in some areas and was a little predictable in the sense of sticking to some fantasy stereotypes. In saying that I did enjoy it, I thought it was quite light for a fantasy book and the character developments were really good. I liked the way magic was used as in each rider had a specific ""skill"". Also I really loved the old sisters in the wood they were my favourite part of the story! I will definitely read the next one!"
3617,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"For me this took a little while to get into, but once it got going I really enjoyed it. I love the strong female lead, and the use of magic - the story was really good and I'm excited to see where it goes. There were so many good characters in it that it kept things really interesting. You can see the inspiration from classic fantasy, but I liked the way it was written so it didn't bother me the way it has in some other books. I'm looking forward reading the rest of the series."
3618,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,"A competent fantasy novel, which I think would definitely appeal to the young adult audience. A little bit under-developed both in character and story-line for my taste but I may try the next in the series to see how it progresses, as there is certainly potential for growth."
3619,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,Pretty standard fantasy. I think I would have liked it more if I read it when I was younger. A lot of it feels like our hero is on a conveyor belt of adventures without any particular agency in the process.
3620,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,"If you grew up reading the fantastic Lioness Quartet by Tamora Pierce like I did, then this series is sure to reignite your love of fantastical worlds and badass heroines. The series follows Karigan as she traverses across Sacoridia as one of the King’s Green Riders, couriers of the Kings most important messages and letters. Gifted with the ability to disappear through time and space, she saves the King and Sacoridia numerous times with both skill and ingenuity as we as readers learn more about"
3621,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"For some reason I wasn’t that excited about starting this book. I don’t know if it was the cover or the fact that I couldn’t find any reviews that mentioned any kind of romance in the story. I know that is a lame reason not to read a book, but I just can’t help but love a good romance in my books. Despite the lack of romance I actually ended up really liking this book. I thought Karigan was an amazing, spunky girl. She is not the type to take no for an answer and she never gives up. Whether she"
3622,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,I actually bought this book years ago. I found it at a local flea market and it sounded appealing - even though I knew nothing about the book or author. I set it aside and read a few reviews of it that made the book sound dreadfully boring and pretty much erased my interest in it. Fast forward until a couple of weeks ago. I was looking at reviews at this very website for books that I was interested in and I thought about this one. I still had my sightly battered copy of Green Rider sitting on my s
3623,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"I really enjoyed this one. It reminded me of things I read when I was younger (90's). A good blend of modern fantasy and post Tolkienesque fantasy. I will definitely be picking up the next book of the series in the future. Read this if you have tried Jeff Wheeler's Kingsfountain books, they have the same borderline juvenile voice/vibe."
3624,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,"I grabbed this book at B&N because it had a horse on the cover and sounded interesting. I was at an event for my son's school and they got a percentage of all sales, so I felt obligated to buy something, but didn't want to spend more than $10. So, at $7.95, Green Rider was one of the best book prurchases I've ever made. I was hooked from the start. The book is fast-paced and packed with magic--which I love. Britain takes you into the story and make you feel like you're there riding alongside"
3625,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,"3.5 stars. A good start to a traditional type fantasy series. Nothing new or revolutionary here, just good old hero/quest/coming-of-age fantasy. This has been on my radar for a while, and I'm glad I finally picked it up. Last month I was looking for an old school traditional fantasy read, but I decided to pick up The Baker's Boy instead of this. I was less than impressed by BB... But I'm happy to say that I found what I was looking for with Green Rider. Like I said, nothing revolutionary.. But I"
3626,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,"Extremely well written book especially considering that it is the first by the author! The book introduces are heroine Karigan into an unenviable position of having to carry a riders message on to it destination while facing a force that is out to stop her. Sounds pretty straight forward a task. As the book continues though the situation escalates until the entire kingdon is threatened, indeed things are not completely resolved at the end of the first book, it may be looked at as the first battl"
3627,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"Enjoyable high fantasy that straddles the fence between YA & adult. While it lurches somewhat awkwardly at times, the story arc is engaging & the characters are good company with room to grow in future books. There's a rather blatant sense of Tolkien at certain points; I've got no issue with that (it's difficult to write this genre without some similarities), but I do think the book is strongest when it forgets to pay homage & instead spreads its own wings as something different from"
3628,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,"The story is nothing much new, but there's a surprising whiff of fresh air to it, mostly due to the characters, I think. I liked the heroine; she came close to being cookie cutter here and there, but for the most part Britain makes an interesting, refreshingly flawed character out of all the cliches. She was unapologetically belligerent, had enough bad judgment to be real, and by the end, it felt like she'd grown up a little, rather than perfect all along and simply misjudged. The final battle see"
3629,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,"I found this book on the floor of my friends room and started reading it for want of something to do. When the time came for me to go home, she let me take it with me, as I was so engrossed in the story. We start with Karigan expelled from school, stumbling across a dying Green Rider, and she is shoved into the role of the heroine right away, as the Rider begs her to carry on his mission. Yes, there are a lot of similarities with other books, there is magic, special abilities and a threat to the"
3630,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,"Two and a half stars. Not that it was bad, but I just couldn't get myself to care and dnf at almost the end of the book. I think (view spoiler) [ the death of the king's dog (hide spoiler) ] did it for me. Otherwise, I found all the characters lacking in depth and all the situations already seen or read somewhere else. Sad that the most colorful and vivid characters of the book was... the ghost. OK, I'm kidding. It was the swords woman working for the bad side. So, if you didn't read a lot of fantasy,"
3631,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"For a debut fantasy novel, I found this to be a very entertaining and engaging read. Karigan is my favourite type of protaganist--very human and relatable, but possessing hidden reserves of strength and courage that help her to overcome challenges and adversity. It's nice to see a female cast in the role of hero for a change. It seems a lot of fantasy novels reserve that role for brawny, strong, kick-ass males. Tons of adventure and magic keep the action fast-paced and interesting. I also liked"
3632,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed this read. It has all the right elements of a classic fantasy. Written with a flowing style and a great cast of characters, it is obviously an opener to a much bigger story that I am looking forward to continuing. Side note. This a clean read, free of obscenities or sex. I found it refreshing, magical, and a lot of fun! Well done. Highly recommended either as a YA or Adult read. Purchase with anticipation of pure fantasy adventure written by a real talent. Enjoy!"
3633,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,"I can't believe it's been over four years since I've read this. Yet every single time I see it on my shelf I smile fondly and my fingers itch to go through the pages one more time. I haven't even continued the series, but this is one of my all-time favorite books. I obviously can't write an accurate review since it's been so long, but I'm hoping some of my friends here on Goodreads will pick this book up because it truly is (was?) a hidden gem."
3634,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,I really like that this story has a lot of leading characters that are female. It's always good to read a story where the person who saves the day is a woman instead of a man. It's a very well written storyline and keeps me wanting more.
3635,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,This is the first book in an amazing series. The plot is unique and engaging! This is one of those books that I find myself reading over and over again! I am never able to put it down. I definately recommend reading this book!
3636,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,Excellent! High fantasy is probably my favorite type of reading and Green Rider doesn't disappoint. I Can't wait to read the whole series. Review also posted at Writings of a Reader
3637,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,"I absolutely just fell in love with the main character and the story. I really can't remember how I came across this series, but it has since turned into one of my most favorite reads ever. I know this series is not for everyone, but I truly loved it."
3638,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,I loved it!!!
3639,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,Look what beautiful covers they give to rubbish books. It's such a shame.
3640,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,This is my novel series jackpot!!!
3641,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"A familiar sort of story with the rare ability to suck me in and keep me hooked. Loved the plot, romance, writing, characterisation. Read. Read. Read."
3642,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,Super cool book.
3643,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,"Fucking phenomenal. What a great book. Great plot, characters, setting, pacing all of it. Thoroughly devoured. Just finished this book again 8/31/15 still a great read."
3644,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,I read these book such a long time ago. I have to go back to them and catch up.
3645,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,"Oh I enjoyed this so much, excited to start the next one!!"
3646,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,"2.5 stars. This is a rough book. It didn't grab me immediately, and even as I finished the last page, I found myself thinking that it felt very pre-2000. Basically: Karigan finds a dying green rider (a special kind of messenger) who entrusts her with a message for the king. She accepts the message and undertakes a dangerous journey to the capital (Sacor City). Once she's there, we find out that (view spoiler) [the message is part of a plot to overthrow the king. Karigan participates in the rescue"
3647,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,1,"Before I start my rant, I have to admit that I read a lot of Fantasy. Like, a lot . I think if I had picked up Green Rider in my early Fantasy days as a teenager, I probably would have loved it, and raved about it, and gone on to buy every book in the series. Unfortunately, while past me may have loved Green Rider, present day me thought it was mediocre - at best. Full disclosure here, I read the first 165 pages, skimmed until I couldn't stand the boredom anymore (I was literally crying in my fr"
3648,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,"After finishing this book, I feel very conflicted. On the one hand, it was a beautifully-written tale rich with magic, adventure, and intrigue. On the other hand, I can't get past the troubling trope of women needing to be raped or sexually violated in some way in order to grow. Every single prominent female character in the book except one is almost raped, threatened with rape, or it's subtly hinted in the narrative that they have been raped in the past. I understand that the world Britain has c"
3649,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"I concur with the blurb by Terry Goodkind about this novel, “A wonderfully captivating heroic fantasy adventure. This Is the rarest of finds: a truly enjoyable read.” Like Goodkind I enjoyed this novel through and through. There was not one part of this story that didn’t entrance me. It was fun and reminiscent of a beloved classic the “Hobbit.” Karigan G’ladheon’s thrust into an adventure like Bilbo and sent on a quest. His task may have been a lot more daunting, but Karigan sure gets into her f"
3650,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"What a satisfying debut novel! I enjoyed this book more than I thought I would and I'm looking forward to reading the next instalment of this series. Readers who love classic fantasy will enjoy Green Rider . The Tolkien inspiration is hard to miss in this book but Britain also managed to make it her own. I liked how the protagonist, Karigan, wasn't particularly a 'chosen one'. How she came to go on her quest was mainly by chance and it was so refreshing that she wasn't a stereotypical cut-out of a"
3651,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,"Remember that time I swore off high fantasy novels forever? Because I'd read several contemporary high fantasy novels in a row that were pure, unadulterated crap? Because I was tired of sexist, racist, unimaginative fantasy worlds that regurgitated the same old formulaic tropes and plots with little creativity and worse writing? Yeah, I need to amend that resolution. Green Rider , despite being several years old and me being late to the party, felt like a fucking breath of fresh air. This is the e"
3652,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,"I’m not saying this is a bad book, but it is not for me. I think my 13 year old self would have really loved it, and if you’re in your early teens, or like “chosen one” fantasy stories, please, by all means, enjoy! I don’t mean that this book is infantile, or that there is something wrong with it. I just know that I would have loved to read this in a Park, imagining that I was an adventurer, lost in the woods, and attempting to fulfill a secret mission when I was a little younger. My current sel"
3653,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,"Back in 2009, a neighbour insisted I read this because the series was her favourite. I'd just finished The Inheritance , which was a pretty heavy read and was looking for something fun and relatively light. This fit the brief perfectly. It's not an entirely original premise or execution of premise, and there are an insane amount of nods to Lord Of the Rings (plus other high fantasy staples!), but over all, it was very enjoyable and I'm extremely sad that I moved away from this neighbour shortly af"
3654,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"That was pretty great! I picked this one up on a whim because I absolutely adore the cover (God, what I would give to cop Karigan's outfit lol), and I'm glad I did. This is like the definition of fantasy adventure. Our heroine, Karigan G'ladheon (great name) is suspended indefinitely from boarding school, and she's kind of a firecracker, so she runs away to go back home before her father can come get her. After a day on the run she comes up a green rider, one of the king's messengers, who is clos"
3655,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,"I'm terrified to realise that it's been over 10 years since I first picked up this series, it's a testament to the author that I remembered so much of the world building and the circumstances around the storyline. Stumbling across a dying messenger, Karigan's only priority is to get home before her father discovers that she's run away from school. Instead she finds herself entrusted with the dying message of a Green Rider and thrown into the intrigues of the court while trying to deliver the mes"
3656,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"This is the sort of book I used to look for when I was a kid. You know, after I finished with Tolkien, Lewis, McKinley, McCaffrey, Jacques, the Forgotten Realms, and some DragonLance. *scratches head* Okay, so that doesn't sound as desperate as it was meant to be. But keep in mind, I read all those authors and series waaaaay before high school. Yep. So there's 12 year old me despairing that the local bookstore doesn't have any more high fantasy/epic adventures to offer. Very much with the despai"
3657,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,"An early but easy decision to quit this book as well (two DNFs in a row! Uh oh!). This book starts out with some action, but the writing feels halting. She did this, then she did this, then she did this. Already, there are things that are too easy for the protagonist (she's fleeing on horseback, then gets off the road to hide, and the pursuers HAPPEN to stop right there to chat loudly about their plans. Oh, and she has a brooch that grants her wishes. Convenient.) After reading some other review"
3658,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"I would wish to give Green Rider 4 1/2 stars. This was my third attempt to read it and, though it took me 10 years, I can finally appreciate the incredible world Kristen Britain created. As you delve deeper into the story, it becomes clear that the author has not created a simple trilogy. No, the intricate world, the depth of the numerous characters, the hints of the coming of a Great War and the many unsolved mysteries all indicate the start of a long Epic Fantasy Series. My inability to put do"
3659,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"I found Green Rider to be an engaging story that kept me flipping pages until I finished it. I enjoyed the main characters but felt that certain feelings and reactions were not as realistic as they should have been--that is, the characters reacted as they did because of dramatic factors rather than being natural. Experienced readers will realize that this was the author's first published novel, but since she has published many more since that time, she has improved her style. I look forward to r"
3660,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,1,"It's been years since I read this book and had completely forgotten about it. Nothing about it grabbed me, except the visual detail of the green clothing for messengers. I remember being bored as I read it and never looked for more in the series or by the author. The main character isn't particularly relatable or likeable, and I don't remember her changing much through the course of the book."
3661,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,"Very classical (in a LotR or tWoT sense - without reaching that level) in it's build up with an ancient evil, an evil sorceror, and a protagonist thrown into the middle of it all, who, then, will have to overcome the evil with spunk and attitude and 'development'. Overall it's a well told story for younger readers."
3662,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,"Feel good fantasy 101 with great prose, a wonderful plot, and a woman main character in an epic fantasy novel! I can't think of anything I disliked. It was just perfect in my eyes. I really enjoy how this is shown through the eyes of a messenger (or to be messenger). That's unique, and not done very often."
3663,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,1,"if black company,wheel of time,malazan were real fantasy this is fantasy's fantasy but i can see the kind of impact this book would have on young girls"
3664,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,"This was disappointing. There is a lot of action, but most of it was unnecessary. It made the story too long and slow. The characters were okay, but they didn't do much for the story. The setting was lovely but overly described. A lot of things were repeated throughout the story. I did like the ending, though. I was surprised by the villain and the way things played out. Also, the ending makes this feel like a standalone, which I liked."
3665,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"Action packed! Karigan G'ladheon has been kicked out of school after a fight with the wrong person--the school bully, who happens to be very rich. She's defiantly trudging along, thinking only about she will break the news to her father, when she stumbles upon a dying man in the forest. His back is full of black arrows, and he wears all green. He is a king's messenger--a Green Rider--and he pleads with her to take over his mission and get this message to the king. The message is of the utmost im"
3666,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"It’s a strange thing to review a book that’s been a part of my life for sixteen years. I don’t know if I’m capable of separating myself from years’ worth of feelings, but I also had a different experience this time around. (An experience that I somewhat regret undertaking??) I needed a bit of time to distance myself from my re-read before I could write this review. Green Rider was a gift from a dear middle school friend when I had to move from New Mexico to Utah. (I was fourteen at the time and e"
3667,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,Green Rider is an exciting fantasy novel full of rich characters and intriguing villains and an enthralling story! Well worth the time.
3668,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,"You are taught very early on that you shouldn’t judge a book by its cover. Sometimes, it totally works for you, as happened for me when I saw the cover to Kristen Britain’s Green Rider. My girlfriend decided to send me into this book with some preconceptions of her own, but I’ve never been duly affected by others opinions. That being said, I was left feeling a little as if the diligence put into the creation of the world and the languages was a little pretentious in light of the apparent juvenili"
3669,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"I randomly bought this with my birthday audiobook subscription after seeing it at the store, simply because I like fantasy and I like horses. Seems feeble reasons, perhaps, but a great find! This book starts as our heroine runs away from boarding school after a fight with another student. Once upon the road homewards, she comes across a rider in green, fleeing with two black arrows sticking out of his back. As he dies, he begs her to take his horse and the message he carries, one of immense impor"
3670,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,"The first in a series of three, Green Rider, is a great fantasy novel. Britain does a great job of grouping adventure, magic, and danger in her book and draws the reader into a wonderful world. Karigan has recently been expelled from school for fighting. Knowing she will be shamed in her father's eyes, she sets off not sure of what to do next. In the deep woods however she encounters a strange rider and his horse. He is dying, two black arrows embedded in his body, and he implores her to complete"
3671,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,"This is the first book in Kristen Britain's Green Rider series from DAW Books and I'm not sure why it took me so long to get around to reading it. Karigan is a student at a school for the wealthy and elite because her father is a successful merchant. But after a sword fight with another student--an aristocrat's son--where she humiliates him, she finds herself in hot water . . . so she runs away. Or rather, she runs from the school, intent on returning home. However, as soon as she leaves she stum"
3672,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,"First off, let me say that I really wanted to like this book. And for those that really enjoyed this book, I am glad. But for me, this book was a bit of a mess of contradictions. Heres's why: While the narrative is very action driven and well paced, the story seemed not to move very far for a 471 page book. No explanation for the system of magic used, it just exists. At times Britain's narrative style bounces back and forth, from that of being exciting and well written, to that of feeling a bit juv"
3673,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,"So, I'm sure that everyone else has a short list comprised of their favorite books. You know, the ones that you have to make sure that you get to read annually (at least!). Well, Green Rider is one of the books on MY list of favorite books. And here's why...firstly, I'm definitely a fan of the Fantasy genre - nothing too ""out there"" abstract type books, but just good Fantasy books. Green Rider has an excellent plot, and Karrigan G'ladheon is a very real & relatable character - in fact, I act"
3674,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,Unfortunately read it straight after Heralds of Valdemar by Mercedes Lackey. Strong sense of deja vu but likely this would have happened whichever I’d read first. It’s ok but not spectacular.
3675,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,"To be quite honest, it took me quite a while to read this book. I'd seen it around for some time, but although interested, I never felt quite motivated enough to read it. Maybe that affected my momentum, because although I thought the story was pretty good and the characters relatively strong, I was unable to push through to the very end, and ended up skimming the last several chapters just to know how it ended. Again, I think the characters were good. The heroine was smart, resourceful, and rela"
3676,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,Heros and horses on 'save the country' type adventures? Count me in! Great start to what I have a feeling will be an engaging series. For more details see my full review on my blog by clicking here
3677,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,"It's been a while since I've read an almost 600 page book, so I hope you guys can forgive how long it took for me to get through this one. I've had a lot on my plate lately! For the most part I liked this read too, though when you're not absolutely adoring a book that can make it even LONGER to get through. I was determined to see it through to the end however, because it feels like it has been on my TBR since the dawn of time! Parts of it were really good and had me gripped, other parts made it"
3678,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"Due to the (sort of) recent release of Blackveil , I decided to reread the first three books in the series. It's been a few years since I first picked up Green Rider, and those years have given me a slightly new perspective, but I stand by my original rating of four stars. Here's why: As many other reviews point out, yes, it is obvious that Green Rider is a freshman novel. There are times at which the prose is stilted, and the plot line is occasionally overly straightforward, but it doesn't detrac"
3679,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,"You know that dream where you are trying to find someone/something or accomplish something but every time you try something happens? You have to run away from something, have to go around something else, someone stops you or distracts you. All the while you are getting more and more frustrated because the thing you are trying to get to is very important, each passing second increases your sense of urgency, but shit just won’t stop happening that gets in the way! That basically sums up my feeling"
3680,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,"Decent fantasy. Nothing to Ouija-message Tolkien about, but it won't make him roll over in his grave, either. I had an intensely hard time caring about Karigan for the first half of the book. Mostly because, for the LIFE of me, I did not understand why she took on her quest. Neither did she. Which isn't interesting to read, frankly. I wanna read about strong-willed, motivated heroes who are fighting to the death, not whiny teenagers rambling through the forest trying to inject meaning into their"
3681,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,"Every now and then I come across a book that I wholeheartedly wish I had written—The Green Rider, with its sprawling fantasy world, magic broaches, intelligent horses, strong heroine, and chilling evil villains—is one of these. When we first meet main character Karrigan G’ladheon, she has just been kicked out of school for winning a fight against a spoiled noble classmate. Unable to face her father, she runs away with only the clothes on her back and a few precious items. But when a king’s messe"
3682,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,"This was a straightforward book with some truly wonderful characters. The protagonist of the story, Karigan G'ladheon, is a spunky, courageous, and imminently lovable young woman. As the story progresses, her strength of character and inherent goodness are revealed. The friends that she makes along her journey disappear, making hers a sojourn of sorts, something that is uncommon to fantasy stories. Also uncommon is that of the enemies she meets early on, only one ends up being a problem for her."
3683,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"If I'd been on Goodreads when I originally read this book as a teen, I would have given it a 5-star rating, hands-down. This was one of the stories that fueled my passion for fantasy. Now I've reread it, and honestly, I did like it better as a teen. There were things I did still enjoy this time around - descriptions of the world, the pacing (most of the time), different characters who were easy to keep track of, cool magic - etc. But it really didn't provide much depth, especially into the chara"
3684,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"In this fantasy, a girl who has run away from school finds a dying messenger rider and agrees to take on his task of delivering a Royal message. As our heroine is a rich merchant's daughter she has a strong body and educated mind, but she's not equal to the evil that pursues her and threatens to subvert the king's rule. Her Green Rider's horse has a mind of his own, which helps, though he's not magical. I was fine with most of the story but the last few chapters lost me to a degree. We've been m"
3685,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,"Karigan, a young woman, finds herself kicked out of school and running away to get home. Little did she know that running away would bring her so much adventure. It starts with her meeting a dying messenger bound to deliver a message to the king, whose lasts words employ Karigan to take the message to the king. Along the way she meets up with strange creatures, people who speak of magic, traitors, and the mysterious `Gray One'. I purchased this book a while ago based on the recommendation from a"
3686,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,"I bought this book after saving up for the hard-cover price the year it came out. I was so glad I got it as a hardback. This book sucks me in every time I read it, which is about every other year. Karigan is a great role model, she's a great heronine and she's interesting (thought she gets knocked out a lot.) She is remarkably lucky, but it doesn't really feel contrived except once, which can be explained by the general premise of the book (not a rock solid explanation by any means, but a passab"
3687,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,"writing this (in 2017) about 15+ years after I read it... I was recently reminded of this book. It was a random pick from the library stacks. I was in grad school and rarely had time for luxury reading. As luck would have it, or not, I got bronchitis and was stuck in bed for days. As I was recouping, I picked up this book... it was a refreshing read, and I was felt like it was the first time I could remember a female protagonist written so naturally (in fantasy novel), it was as if it was not un"
3688,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,"This book didn’t wow me, but it was still a fun read similar to novels like Lord of the Rings , where the fate of a kingdom depends on one unwitting person. The Green Rider centers on Karigan, a feisty young woman who must send a message to the king in order to save the kingdom. It relied on several conventional themes of fantasy novels, the old evil that threatens to rise again, the unlikely heroine that must go on her own journey to persevere and save the kingdom. And of course, it wouldn’t be"
3689,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,"If I was to ask you to imagine a standard fantasy pot boiler, you'd probably come up with something like this. It's not bad, it's just very predictable. We have a young heroine, a King, a shadowy ""grey"" rider, heapings of magic and of course a lot of coincidences. All the elements are in place for your basic fantasy story. All of which sounds kind of bad. It's really not though. It's just average is all. There are points where writing is a little heavy handed, and I'm still not sure why the author"
3691,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"I found this book in a search of available e-books for lend from my library. The description made the book sound interesting, so I reserved it. I'm really glad I did. This book draws you in from the beginning and you'll have a hard time putting it down. The story is intricately woven with many layers. The only thing I had trouble with was the age of the main character. When I started the book, I thought she was about 13, but after reading the book, I think she's closer to 16 or 17. I wish the au"
3692,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,"While all the sword and sorcery, wizards and kings, Chosen Ones, and magic items are fairly middle of the road Epic Fantasy stuff, the main character shines bright throughout. First, she stumbles into the whole plot because she was going as fast as she could, trying to get home before the mail, so her dad can at least hear her version of why she got expelled before he gets the letter from the school. She does the standard 'I'm-no-chosen-one-the-magic-dohickey-must-be-wrong' speech, but instead of"
3693,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,"Not a bad little epic fantasy book. Has some fun moments, a plucky heroine, and so on. Suffers from some pacing issues, especially near the beginning. Not a bad ending, but like the whole book, wanders around a bit. Probably the biggest issue I have with this one is that there are too many adjectives and adverbs at play in the prose. A stringent edit could have tightened it up a bit more. Some leeway has to be given because it's epic fantasy, and it's a first book. Leeway given. That said, a few"
3694,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,"I just loved this little story! What a gem of a book, I simply can NOT figure out how I've missed this one. It's got some Lord of the Rings taste in there (not that I would hold it on the same plane as that at all) with a heroine you can root for, characters you can love, hate, adore and feel loathing for. It's very quick paced, which I loved, but there are also times when the descriptions dragged on. This would be my only complaint, a little overly descriptive, but I think that was only bothers"
3695,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,The book is well written. The heroine was a teenage girl with teenage attitude only doing what needed doing when all other choices were removed. It was this which created most of the adventure in the novel. The story begins with her being suspended from school and trying to reach home before the notice of her suspension. She meets a messenger who has been shot in the back with two black arrows and as he is dying he enlist Karigan to finish his task for him. She meanders through the kingdom meeti
3696,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"I remember picking this one up in my massive Boomerang books order simply because of a few good reviews on Amazon. And you know what, it's actually really good. I'm a sucker for the 'no good kid is actually surprisingly good at this one thing and wows everyone at it'. Mercedes Lackey is infamous for that type of plot and I fall for it every time. My memory is so great I don't even remember the name of the main character. :D. KARIGAN. Yay for google. Karigan is running away from school when she s"
3697,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,I really liked this book though I probably would have liked it more if I could have read it faster. Things kept getting in the way. I'm excited about the potential of the story - there's so much to this world. I found the whole idea of Green Riders very unique. There were a few times when I thought the plot could move a bit quicker or maybe not have so many details but for the most part the story moved along at a good pace. I liked the characters but I don't love any of them yet. Even Karrigan.
3698,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,"Pretty generic fantasy novel. It had some beautiful turns of phrase but the majority of the writing was average. Magic system seems to have depth, but is the type that can never be fully explained and thus never fully utalized by the protaganist. The character development of the protagonist is weak, but some of the supporting characters and villans are deep and realistic. It is a fast read, almost too fast, one event blends into the next with little if any transition. I haven't decided wether I"
3699,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,"My husband introduced me to Britain's Green Rider, and I am so glad he did! Britain has created a wonderful heroine without making her an unnatural female of her time. So many female protagonists are unnaturally stubborn or strong willed for their fictional world, but Karigan is not only a brilliant heroine but fits within the world she lives in as a strong, independent female. This book and the one following are a little choppy in changes of perspective in character. This failing improves great"
3700,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,"I'm not much of a fantasy fan, but my sister swore to me that if I read this book my long drive to Utah would go by really fast. She was right! It did. I got to the library as soon as I got home to get the 2nd and 3rd in the series. For me it was one of those books where I didn't want to do anything but read and read. Bed time could not come soon enough and as soon as my kids were in bed I was reading. A great escape. The only sidenote I will add is the other takes her time with the series so wh"
3701,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,"A re-read. I first read this when the book was first released, nearly sixteen years ago (also, WTF how has it been that long?) and remember loving it, though I recognized at the time that it was obviously very heavily influenced by Mercedes Lackey's Valdemar books. Re-reading this, that has not changed. And through adult eyes rather than teenaged ones, I can also see the flaws apparent in the writing. The plot is contrived and the main character is less a character and more an agent of the plot,"
3702,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,"It took me a long time to get into this story and connect to the main character. If I hadn't been reading this for book club I would not have finished it. There is not nearly enough character development in the first half of the book for me to understand or like Karrigan, who comes across as very immature and uninspired. The fantasy is pretty basic and light and reminiscent of classic fantasies like Tolkien. Although I eventually came around to Karigan, I didn't find the writing, world, or chara"
3703,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,"I didn't expect to like this book much, having it be some dusty, slightly yellowing pages that my mother dug up from the basement, but the book was great. I really got sucked into the world and the whole thing was very believable and realistic. It wasn't much longer after that I was digging into the second book and begging my dad to pick up the fourth one, once I'd reached the third, because it had already come out that month. The book was amazing, and it only gets better throughout the rest of"
3704,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,Reminds me a little bit of Mercedes Lackey's Herald series in that there is a special bond between rider's and their horses. But there is also the element of special magical talents with certain rider pins. This is a fun fantasy novel that I had no problem getting caught up with. My favorite part was when Karigan meets two old ladies in the woods. Exciting adventure. Oh - and there is now a second book (someone reviewed here that they wished there was one): First Rider's Call.
3705,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,"I read this book a few years ago, along with the second book. The third just came out this year so I decided to read them again. This book is full of adventure and struggle. I love the main character Karigan and how she struggles against becoming a Green Rider but always ends up helping her kingdom by taking on the role without meaning to. It is a great series and I will hopefully get onto the second book so I can read the newest edition of Karigan's adventures."
3706,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,"I tried to read this book many many years ago, and gave up on it. Something about it called to me again, so I thought I'd give it a try. I am so glad I did. The first time I tried to read this I was obviously not in a mindset for fantasy, but this second time around. I LOVED IT. Sure there were some predictable elements, but I found this book to be captivating, fun, and exciting. In fact, it's one of the few books that I honestly could not put down."
3707,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,"I bought this book mostly beacuse I liked the cover. Also, the name Karrigan (the protagonist) appealed to me. I thought I had made a terrible mistake when I first started reading, since I couldn't quite get into it. The writing style was.. not quite right, somehow. I kept at it though, found the groove of the style, and was pleasantly surprised to have found a pretty good book! This one is good stuff."
3708,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,"While the writing style was not particularly literary (& I suppose could be considered a bit elementary to some), and the world was perhaps not the most unique or deeply-imagined kingdom.... this book was thoroughly enjoyable, kept me turning the pages & had all the ingredients of a good fantasy fairy tale -- castles, kings, brave girl and her horse, a hint of romance, lots of magic & a dangerous quest. I will definitely continue on the sequels!"
3709,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,"Meh. MarySue heroine, unclear writing (are groundmites bugs? why do they have shields? if they aren't bugs... what are they?), and WAY too many plot digressions. There was just no sense of urgency in the writing. Times when the tension SHOULD be high, suddenly the heroine is having tea or sweeping a cabin or something. There was a lot about this book that I wanted to like, but I ended up having to force myself to finish it. Disappointing."
3710,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,"This book was really entertaining. For some reason I had trouble getting invested in the more actiony scenes and I never felt like I got a good grasp of most of the characters. But I ended the book wanting to read the next one and see where the story goes. So yeah, I liked it. But also, it kind of just made me want to reread the Alanna books by Tamora Pierce instead. Same feel, better writing (in my opinion)."
3711,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"Apparently I have a much higher tolerance for high fantasy if I'm listening to an audiobook, because I was never able to get into this book until I tried the audio. It's the favorite book of a good friend of mine, though, so I was determined. Great world-building, intriguing plot, good action sequences, interesting characters, and fun! 4 stars for now, but I might bump it up later as the book sits with me for longer."
3712,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,"This is probably my most repeatedly read book. I think I first read it in seventh or eighth grade, and it's one of those books that I read about every year. I just like the main character, and the story is pretty normal/predictable but in a lovable way. Can't describe its appeal exactly, but I like it a lot. I just read this one again on my way home to Iowa this year in January."
3713,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,"Low side of 3 stars. I found the story's lack of sophistication disappointing. The author is not as good as Tamora Pierce, Anne McCaffery, or Mercedes Lackey at plotting, characterization, or world building. The story was very linear, and the enemies straightforward. Probably would not have cared as much when I was younger, and it still better than a lot of modern YA."
3714,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,I read this book again after almost 15 years. I had read it as a teenager several times and loved it. I reread it because I recently discovered the rest of the series. I was just as enthralled as the first time I read it. Good writing and a fantastic story line made me feel like a a young girl again.
3715,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,1,"I think I struggled about 45 pages into this. That was about 42 pages too many. I hate to trash what I believe is a first novel, by someone who's clearly trying hard. But this was just really a poor book. I don't think that anybody in our book club made it more than about 1/4 way through the book."
3716,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,"As a lover of fantasy novels, I've picked this book up a handful of times in bookstores. But I've never went for it. I now see I was stupid. What a wonderful book!! An easy interesting read. I now have a new favorite fantasy series to add to my bookshelves. And I'm very excited to continue on with Karigan."
3717,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,"Green Rider! Oh sweet Green Rider! My best friend has been recommending this series to me for 3 years, and I FINALLY got around to reading the first one. I cannot believe that I waited this long. I kinda want to kick myself for waiting! I'm glad that I bought all 4 books because I'm starting First Rider's Call right now! Highly recommend this series."
3718,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,"somewhere on Amazon I saw this recommended, looked interesting, got it out of the library ... The beginning was thoroughly mediocre; I've seen better amateur fiction on-line. I started skimming through it, and the story picked up a bit, to the point where it was entertaining enough, though not particularly original in any way. I doubt I'll be seeking out the author's other books."
3719,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,"This book is a pretty standard fantasy novel that I read when I was younger and has stood the test of time pretty well. Apart from a few fantasy tropes that seem a bit too familiar, it has an engaging plot and enough interesting well-rounded characters to make up for the few bland ones. I found out that there were sequels to this book way after the fact and I look forward to reading them next."
3720,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,Interesting!!! It took me a while to get into it but then the action/treachery and intrigue got the better of me. Karigan is a fabulous female protagonist. And I'm keen to see what her next step is in life. King Zachary was wonderful but I wanted to know more. A lot of the characters grab you straight away. I'll certainly read the rest of the series.
3721,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,"I don't know if I missed the point of this book or not, but I found it fairly uninteresting and...well, incomplete. I read the last word and thought, ""Uhh...okay. What was the point of reading that?"" So yeah...not too thrilled. If somebody can explain to me the clever subtleties I missed, maybe I'll change my mind!"
3722,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"So, I wrote a review for this when I read it but accidentally deleted a whole bunch of reviews when I was reorganizing my shelves... So I guess I just have to read them all again so I can give accurate reviews :D"
3723,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,"A lot of fun - really more like 3.5 stars. Not up there with the absolute best fantasy, but as something I picked up in an airport because I was burnt out on school-type-reading, it was very enjoyable and definitely scratches the typical-fantasy-novel itch."
3724,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,"One of the best books that I have ever read. Lots of fun and adventure. The beginning starts out a little slow and simple, but it picks up after that. Magic + adventure + quest + well written + drop of romance = Really entertaining and good read!"
3725,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,This story is just as good the however-the-many-th time around as it was the first time I read it almost 15 years ago. This book remains my all-time favorite and at the top of my recommendations list. Karigan and company never cease to pull me in and take me on a wild ride.
3726,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,"4.5 -- not quite a full 5 stars but I enjoyed it more than 4 stars. Exactly the kind of book I enjoy most, and with several in the series already published so nothing to wait for. Plus-- lots of horses and magic."
3727,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"This is a book about a heroine who finds herself in an adventure she never expected, so it's a learning experience for her as well as for the reader. I enjoyed the world Kristen Britain created and hope to visit it again in the sequel."
3728,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,"Y'all know how much I love a good fantasy novel, and GREEN RIDER certainly delivered! Some elements reminded me of George RR Martin, and other pieces reminded me of Mercedes Lackey, but have no doubts, Britain has her own, unique voice."
3729,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,"I really enjoyed this book though it took me a few pages to really get hooked. However, Karigan is a well rounded character and I liked how it ended. I am definitely going to read the other books but this one could be a stand alone."
3730,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,"Woo finally finished! I read this book mostly during my lunch break at work. I really enjoyed it. The main character was relatable, the action was intense at some points, and I never felt like the plot line dragged. I have already bought the second book and plan to start reading it soon!"
3731,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,"I really enjoy this series. The characters are realistic, the plot intriguing and thoughtful. The universe is fantasy based with no technology. There is a bit of magic that is intwined with the series."
3732,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,I really enjoyed this book - there is a lot of action and magic! The main character gets in the middle of a rider sending a message to the king or is she chosen? Seems to be that she was chosen to be a Rider even though she denies her quest. I can't wait to read the next book!
3733,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,"I really wavered back and forth between whether I should rate this 2 or 3 stars. The story was interesting, but I think the main character was a little undeveloped...400+ pages and I don't feel like I really knew her. Basically I finished the book feeling vaguely unsatisfied."
3734,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,"I've been meaning to read this for a while now, and I did enjoy it, but parts of it dragged on. Also, King Zachary is a creeper and I don't like it. Please do not describe how aged he seems and then cause him to flirt with the young heroine. Really, just don't."
3735,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,"Absolutely loved every aspect of this book, couldn't put it down once i started it! Aspects of Action, romance, fantasy, and amazing descriptions made this book awesome...!"
3736,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,"Oh god, apostrophes. (That is not the only criticism I have of this book, but it's an important one to note.)"
3737,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,couldn't help but think this was very like tamora pierce it was abit slow to get into but when i did wow awesome book
3738,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,Was hoping to find a fantasy series that would grab me. Think this one may succeed. First Rider's Call already waiting on my shelf.
3739,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,I LOVED this book. It was very well written and I found it really hard to put down.
3740,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,1,"I believe I tried to read this when I first moved out to California (c. 1989, 1990?). I was bored and unimpressed and didn't even finish it."
3741,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,1,"He who gave me this book said it was ""a step or two above Mercedes Lackey"". I think that gives it substantially too much credit, or perhaps Lackey too little. Pure extruded fantasy product."
3742,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"The details to the story were a little fuzzy at first. I wasn't quite sure what was going on, though it got more clear as the book went on."
3743,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,"Love, love, LOVED this book! This is a fantastic fantasy book with intense scenes and characters and a world which completely drew me in!"
3745,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,One of the best books I have ever read! Couldn't put it down and made sure I had the second book lined up before I finished
3746,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"3.5 Stars I guess I enjoyed this a little bit more this time around, though the MC can be a little bit irritating at times."
3747,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,It was only OK. A classic coming of age tale with a self discovery / saving the world journey with an obvious outcome. Good for beginners who don't like too much excitement.
3748,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,I liked The Horse.
3749,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,A good read. I enjoyed it. Eager to start book 2 to see what will happen to Kerigan and Sacoridia
3750,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,Great fantasy/adventure story with a spunky young heroine. A satisfying read although it is the first book of a series. Definitely planning to read more.
3751,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"Loved it.. Now, I am starting the second one! :D"
3752,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"""When you aren't committed to the outcome of the game, there is no way you can win."" This book has been sitting unread on my shelf for quite a while now, and I feel very badly for not having cracked it open sooner; it was a very good read! The story follows a young woman named Karigan G'ladheon, fleeing her school after having been expelled for supposedly instigating and then taking part in a brawl. As she travels through the forest on her journey home she happens upon a young man with two black"
3753,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"I really want a Green Rider great coat now. I went into this book knowing next to nothing about it, only that it had a spunky female lead and that the man who recommended it to me spoke very, very highly of it. It lived up to it though, and I was surprised with all the twists and turns and there were times when I couldn't predict what would happen. I did enjoy the little ties between all the characters, the chance meetings and how they were all tied together even if they didn't know it at the tim"
3754,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,"I have some passion for YA, as they are called today, and this was a more than decent book for young people of any age. Sadly, in many aspects it falls rather flat. The plot is quite straightforward, and the conflicts and dramatic moments are never really resolved by the MC, they kind of put themselves back on kilter on their own, and that said, our girl Karigan never really gets to decide much. I fully believe that this book would have been better if the author didn't fall to the temptation of s"
3755,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,"I was actually initially warned off this book due to the apparent similarities to LotR. I didn't see it. What I did see was a strong similarity to the Heralds of Valdemar series, especially to the first series, Arrows of the Queen. That said , no one should write off this book simply because it strikes a cord with another series. They are similar. They are messengers who act as spies, military and whatever other functions the kingdom needs them to. The ""Greenies"" and the Heralds both have individu"
3756,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"I don’t know how I found this book. I’m not generally a fan of fantasy novels. But I like the idea of themso I keep trying. I usually lose patience with the lengthy world-building and confusion of too many foreign names that generally fill the first 100 pages. I must have used the right search terms, or found this via another novel I enjoyed, I suppose, because I did enjoy it. There are strong female characters, the young heroine in particular. Kerrigan has just been suspended from her private sc"
3757,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"Stealing a book summation, ffr: The book opens by introducing the Gray One, a mysterious character who creates a minute crack in the D'Yer Wall. The Wall has stood for a thousand years without sign of wear, and would have stood for thousands more years. Its purpose is to enclose Kanmorhan Vane, or Blackveil forest, and Mornhavon the Black. Karigan G'ladheon , a merchant's daughter, is cast out of her school in Selium by Dean Geyer following a duel which resulted in her besting a wealthy aristocrat"
3758,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,"This was an ok read for me, but not a huge hit for my taste. It felt extremely derivative to me, especially the first half of the book which felt like a mashup of Mercedes Lackey's Valdemar books and Lord of the Rings. From the introduction/foreward it seems like the author got a boost earlier in her career from Terry Goodkind and in the book there's a little shoutout to him as the character encounters the River Terrygood which made me chuckle a bit when I got to it. The plot falls into two halves"
3759,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"The last book I remember reading that was as long as this was Harry Potter and the Goblet Of Fire (back when it released) and that took me four days. In contrast, Green Rider (at 500 and something pages) took me a day and it felt like just a few hours. If I’m being completely honest, I’d never have picked up Green Rider if I’d seen it in a bookshop - at least not with the old cover(s). I guess it’s a good thing then that I didn’t see the cover when I chose this. Sometimes the best thing you can d"
3760,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,"I am so disappointed in this book. It's been popping up in my 'if you liked this, you'll like that' recommendations for years and I finally gave it a chance and it fell so flat. The premise is awesome. A young girl, Karigan (what an awesome name) takes over from a Green Rider - essentially a royal messenger - when he dies in front of her. Adventure and cross-country exploring ensues as she valiantly tries to give her message to the King and fulfill her destiny. Based on the story alone, this is"
3761,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"Oh, I liked this. I've been aching for a fantasy series where A) there is more than one woman, and B) the magical fantasy series *actually features some magic.* Honestly, it is perfectly incredible how many fantasy books fail to have any use of magic in their pages. Magic is deserted to some degree by the society in this tale, and only certain people use it -- but the characters we follow, including our heroine, are among those that do. Magic permeates the story, and I for one say: about TIME. I"

3763,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,The Good: The world itself is interesting. Britain has obviously put a lot of though into how her literary world works from it's inhabitants to it's landscape to it's politics and even the games played within it. The Green Riders are a particularly interesting group looked down upon by their fellow soldiers for being merely messengers when in reality they possess one of the few remaining sources of magic. I was particularly intrigued by the more seasoned riders including one who spends most of t
3764,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,"When I read that this book was compared to Tamora Pierce's novels I rejoiced! Though some folks compare them to Lackey's Valdemar series due to the mystical horses, the worlds are very different, and the way the magic works is very different. The Pierce comparison is far more astute. A well written adventure about a young woman facing challenges and growth, and learning about the magic that now surrounds her, this novel does a nice job of introducing several characters that I'm sure we'll see mor"

She runs away from her school after she is suspended and this is when the writer begins to delve into the heart of the story. As the main character is being introduced, it switches to the view of another, darker, and magical villain. The magic of the book is not explained well, but the author still attempts to explain how the villain uses his magic. She as"

So, off I went on this Wild Ride, but alas, there were serious stumbles. I am dismounting after this book. The good: The beginning was promising with the hints of magic, politics, and intrigue. I think The Horse is a great character, and the tropes were familiar but cozy. The writing was solid, for the most part. The bad: The second half of the book is where I started to get frustrated.

3767,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,"I really wanted this to be a 4-star book, but I just couldn't quite get there. Green Rider is pretty clearly a first novel, which isn't necessarily a bad thing (all authors have to start somewhere!). While I'll definitely check out Britain's later books to see how she matures as a writer, I can only judge this book for what it is and not what it could have been, thus the 3-star rating. First of all, the plot kept moving very quickly in this book, with enough pauses in the action to keep me from f"

It was OK enough that I did finish the whole book, and these days I am finding it much easier to abandon any book I really don't like, even if I paid for it. The main thing that made me not like this book was that there were too many ""saves"" of Karigan by outside forces/characters rather than her being a strong and clever person to get herself out of seemingly impossible situations. I was relieved, of course, that she was r"

I thought, ""maybe I need to step away and give it a try later."" It was easier the second time, not easy, but easier.

3777,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,"A very nostalgic read. I tried to keep in mind this book is about 20 years old when I compared the female main character to the current female main character tropes. It wouldn't surprise me if this series was one of the ""founding mothers"" of female POV. I really enjoyed this book thinking of it like that, watching and seeing how the female in fantasy has evolved. The plot is very classic as well.

The only thing it is missing is a map - which I must say is something that I sort of ""count on"" in fantasy literature so that was slightly disconcerting. I"

Not that it was a bad cover, but that it was not the type of book I would normally feel drawn to. I was wrong.

3785,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,"I think this book had lots of potential, but there was just too much to make it work. The tone was I think what kills the deal. It's rudimentary, so much that there's no real sense of danger. Nothing feels like it's lurking in the corner ready to attack, when I think that's what the author wanted. I was never worried about Karigan or anyone else. And even if something bad happened, the tone made it hard to care. The main plot also needs work.

It was so good to return to a more adult epic fantasy with magicians, I haven't read a book like this in so long. Plus I forgot how amazing Australia's epic fantasy writers are!! Definitely continuing this series ASAP."
3836,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,"This was another recommendation from Waterstones, and ended up being well worth my time. Trudi Canavan was an author I kept hearing of, but had never tried any of her work until now. I figured the best place to start was with her novels was Black Magician Trilogy. Sonea is a dwell from the city of Imardin, where the Magicians live, train their novices and practice theirs arts. We begin the novel with Sonea present at the purge; an event where the Magicians cleanse the city of undesirables. As the"
3837,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,"Sonea, a slum girl, had no idea she has magic until the day of the Purge where she accidentally hurt a magician. The magicians ‘s guild became interested to her, resulting to a long hard search along the slums, which in Sonea’s case, an exhausting run, hiding here and there with her friend Cery. In desperation, they even asked help from Thieves. But the Magicians are too determined to give up on her. Especially that, without proper training, Sonea’s power is uncontrollable and dangerous. The magi"
3838,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,5,"“It is said, in Imardin, that the wind has a soul, and that it wails through the narrow streets because it is grieved by what it finds there.” How I hadnt known about this book until now??? It was everything I looked for in a fantasy. Which is mainly magical school. :D No, but seriously, I love the trope of magical schools and this one was done brilliantly. The story captivated me literally from the first page and I was hooked until the end. The writing was phenomenal. Only thing that I would ch"
3842,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,2,"Sonea lives in the slums with her Aunt and Uncle and is no longer allowed to associate herself with her friends and their gang. However, during the annual Purge, she meets them again and gets mixed up in their stone-throwing hatred towards the Guild Magicians. When the deep, concealed magic she has within her is loosened, Sonea must hide herself because the Magicians are after her: no-one from the slums have ever showed magical potential and they are scared, but not as scared as Sonea. I had read"
3844,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,2,"I really can't understand the popularity of this book. It was almost bad for me. The main problem was the lack of character development, especially the heroine's. They were all paper-cuts, without depth or emotions. The heroine was a silly girl, wanting to escape the Magician's Guild, although she has great power, because ""the magicians are bad"". And the first half of the book details her attemps to escape them and theirs to capture her. They get close, she escapes, they get closer, she escapes"
3845,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,"The first half of this book was admittedly not a good read. The last half, however, was astounding. The only reason this book didn't get 5 stars from me is because of the beginning. There, now I've discouraged most of you into starting this... because who wants to suffer through a book just to get to a good part? We want the book to be good from the beginning, right? Wrong. Well, that should be your answer, at least in this case. Somehow the slow beginning really pushed the lifestyle Cery and So"
3848,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,1,"I wanted to like this, I really did, but the magicians were so weak and whiny that I gave up around 34% through. I skipped to 96% and read the end which filled me in nicely on what I had skipped, so I don't even feel like I missed anything. The only thing I liked at all in this book was Cery. It wasn't enough to keep my interest amid so many things that annoyed me, and I won't be recommending this one."
3851,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,"3.5 Surprisingly enjoyable, although the YA style showed in some of the voices - they were quite childish, especially in the end. The explanations were simplistic and the conflicts - relatively easily resolved. Unsurprisingly, I'm mostly interested in Dannyl."

3857,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,3.5 🌟 Interesting. I see myself continuing the series. Curious on how part 2 going to play out. This book had a lot of magicians rules. Backstabbing untrustworthy people. Thieves the rich the poor etc.

3860,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,"Some books are about beautiful writing, some about memorable characters and others are about plotting an intricate story line. This, for me, was a plot driven book, my interest sustained by the story, the writing a means to an end rather than an end in itself. It is a book of two halves with strong central characters, in the returning slum dwelling girl Sonea and the wise mage and teacher Rovthen. There is a degree of world building as Canavan sets out her stall with a city state with an internal c"
3862,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,"This is the first book in the Black Magician series. I have had this book on my shelf to read for quite awhile. It was a decent fantasy book, but the pacing is a bit slow and the plot is repetitive. I listened to this on audiobook and the audiobook was very well done. The narrator is pleasant to listen to and does character voices well. I would definitely recommend listening to this on audiobook. The magician’s of Imardin have gathered to do their yearly purge of undesirables from the Inner City."
3863,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,1,"There's so much wrong with this book it's not even funny. I'm surprised it got published and even more surprised I read it through the end. Imagine if The Hunger Games and Harry Potter had a child, add some bizarre mutation of bad writing and you'll get The Magician's Guild. All the characters are bland, their dialogues are repetitive and shallow, the attempt at world building falls flat, the pace is agonizingly slow and the plot is like someone trying to tell a joke starting with the punch line"
3864,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,5,"Okay, I'll go straight to the point. The Black Magician Trilogy is my favorite trilogy-ever. I've read it five, or six years ago, can't even remember exactly when, and I still love it all the same. The interesting thing about those books is how I came to buy them in the first place. I was in the bookshop, browsing, when I suddenly saw it on the shelf. I immediately liked the cover. White, with a mysterious magician... I thought that it was unusual, but interesting whatsoever. Then, I took this book"
3866,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,"3.5 stars. The Magicians' Guild doesn't quite get 4 stars from me because all of the running around and hiding the main character Sonea does drags on for too long. I think if we had gotten past this part a lot sooner and more would have happened I would have liked it enough to give it 4 stars. I wasn't real crazy about Sonea for a while, but she grew on me. I liked both Rothen and Dannyl a lot and I hope the next book gives more character development for both of those characters. Cery was ok, bu"
3867,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,1,"I always thought that the door to the publishing world was closely guarded, and that to be a successful novelist you had to be brilliant enough to shine through the sea of muck pouring through to the editor's desk. Trudi's characters are interesting enough to force me to buy the second (not the third) book in this trilogy, but only with the gritted teeth and angry soul with which a house wife watches the next day's As The World Turns, knowing that she could watch all year and she'd never know if"
3868,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,5,"YA fantasy 12+ I really enjoyed this series! It's fast paced, has an engaging story and an interesting world. Each year the magicians of Imardin gather together to purge the city streets of vagrants, urchins and miscreants. Masters of the disciplines of magic, they know that no one can oppose them. But their protective shield is not as impenetrable as they believe. The main character was really easy to identify with. It didn't take me long to feel and root for her. The story kept me sucked into thi"
3870,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,"I loved the idea even though it reminded me a bit few other books about magicians and thieves that I read recently. I can't really say that The Magician's Guild was very unique, but I enjoyed the idea anyway. Book's background is well-thought and the author put lots of effort on thinking about prehistory. Authors style was okay, but nothing marvellous and thrilling (I guess we all know that feeling when we could read a total nonsense, but it's written so well, that it's enjoyable anyway). Though"
3872,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,3.5 stars Decent fantasy novel. I found it suffered from a common flaw in first books of a series -- a bit too much set-up at the cost of plot. I did like the fact that Canavan just drops the reader into her world & leaves him/her to figure things out (with the assistance of the maps & glossary provided). I liked it enough to be curious about what will happen in the next books of the trilogy!
3875,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,"I didn't really need to read this, as it turns out. I'd already read the second volume, and there was basically nothing in this that wasn't described adequately there. I was surprised at how much of the book passed before the magicians found Sonea and took her to the school. Pretty slow, really, with more background than necessary. I liked Sonea and Cery and Rothen as characters but was kind of bored. The High Lord, who is central to the plot of book two, hardly appears in this."
3876,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,2,"The author tried, but IMO failed, to create a social class difference by writing too much about how and why Sonea hide herself from the Guild. Too much unnecessary writings and repetition of similar events in this book hindered the flow of the story. Also, the author neglected character development. Although the pace of the story picked up in the second half of the book, it could have been better if the first half was more compact."
3877,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,2,"2.25 stars....This book was such a disappointment. I went into it expecting to really enjoy it, but was overall so let down by the characters, cliches, simple plot and just overall how tedious it was...Although it did get a little better by the end and some moments had potential, but not enough to shine through, sadly....I'm not sure if I'll read the sequel, but it's very unlikely at the moment."
3878,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,"My full review of this trilogy will be posted on the last book, but I liked this. It drew me into the story, though I think there was perhaps a little too long spent in the same old rut in the slums. I got to caring about the characters that I was obviously meant to care about, and I hated the ones I was supposed to hate. Not groundbreaking, but enjoyable enough."
3879,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,1,"This book is a bestseller. Why? Here's the plot: wizards exist, and they're all noble and all belong to a wizard's guild. Then a poor girl is discovered to have magic, and the high born wizards have to convince her to trust them so they can teach her to control it before it destroys her and everything around her. Along the way, some people are jerks. There, now you don't need to read it."
3882,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,"Very engaging, strong plot and characters and an interesting world - just the kind of fantasy I like. I'm looking forward to the rest of the trilogy."

I originally read this book a couple of years ago when a friend lent it to me. That same friend has now gifted me the entire trilogy, so I figured there was no harm in rereading it and finding out whether I still love it as much as I did then. I do, kinda, but not quite in the same way. High fantasy is more of a guilty pleasure of mine than anything else. It has certain tropes and identifyi"

3893,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,"An easy read although a little disappointing. The premise - a society where extremes of poverty and wealth exist, and where prejudice ensures that no one from the slums is examined for magical potential and offered a place at the Magicians' Guild university - is interesting. A young woman, Sonea, accidentally discovers she has magic when she throws a stone at the magicians as they perform the periodic 'clearing' of slum people known as the Purge. They recognise her ability, because her anger dri"
3895,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,5,"I stumbled across this book series through my friend who is passionately obsessed with everything Canavan, so naturally, as a good friend I decided it was time to check it out. Okay, he said it was a fantasy with gay moments and I was instantly hooked. It's hard not to want to get your hands on a book like that. Good fantasy is exciting enough but good fantasy with gays? Oh, yes. Sonea is a young slum girl who lives in a world in which magic is real but limited to those belong to the Magician's G"

3897,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,2,"So after what feels like a small eternity, I am finally finished with this book. Finished with what has to be one of the dullest, slowest and most disappointing books I've read in a while. I don't even know where to begin with this review - my notes on this book are mostly just the same thing over and over again; how boring it is. How I've read 100, 200 and then almost all of it, and I am still waiting for things to actually start happening. ""The Magicians' Guild"" just dragged out so ridiculousl"
3898,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,2,"The first in the Black Magician trilogy, a coming-of-age tale focusing on a girl called Sonea, a commoner who’s power is so strong she is able to work rudimentary magic (something that hasn’t happened for hundreds of years, as magic must be unlocked.) The first novel follows her from the gutter, to a minor riot, to a cat-and-mouse game between herself and the magicians and then finally her inevitable capture. This book came out clinging to the coat-tails of Harry Potter, though offers none of th"
3899,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,2,"Canavan had a good idea that was ruined by the description on the back of the book and the fact that this is the first book in a trilogy. Lately, I've been ragging on the ""Start-of-a-series Syndrome"", in which the author is so preoccupied with SETTING UP their story that they forget to TELL their story. From the beginning (and the fact that this is Book One of three), you KNOW that Sonea is going to exhibit magic, then the Guild is going to want to find her - that's all on the back of the book. T"
3901,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,"It wasn't that bad. But not great either. The biggest problem for me was the slow beginning. Sonea's hide and seek from the Guild (at first, it seemed an interesting idea not to put her in the magic school right from the first encounter) took sooo much time and pointless struggle that it became boring. I also felt that the protagonist was frustratingly passive throughout the whole first half. She did nothing on her own intent and only followed instructions proposed by others. I couldn't even tel"
3902,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,5,"If you loved Brandon Sanderson’s Mistborn series, then you will absolutely love the Black Magician Trilogy. The Black Magician Trilogy, written by Trudi Canavan, is an utterly fantastic book trilogy that I would recommend to anyone with even the slightest interest in fiction. Unlike a lot of other book series, such as my own, this series is short and succinct, wrapping up with only three books (to be fair there is a prequel novel and sequel series, but I would prefer to think that those books do"

3906,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,1,"What a raging disappointment this book was! I expected badass magicians and fight sequences and emotion and, well, basically what I expected was a good book and what I got was a book that is mediocre at best. I can't even properly formulate an argument I'm so angry. Or bitter, at least. Do you know, it took until page 247 to even capture the girl? A girl from poverty living in the slums was able to outsmart an ENTIRE GUILD OF MAGICIANS for half the bloody book! If you want to read this, just ski"
3907,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,"3,5 stars A book very well written but which lacks a little something ... A little anger, a stone thrown and everyone discovers that Sonea is a magician, something that should be impossible because she is not a noble. If the Magicians' Guild is torn about her fate, they all agreed on the fact that she absolutely must be recovered. Tracked down in the maze of the capital, Sonea will have to quickly distinguish between friends and enemies ... The author's style is really nice, the world that he creat"
3908,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,1,"I really tried to like this book. I really did. I picked it up because I was in the mood for some fantasy escapism and willing to suspend disbelief. Unfortunately, this book is too poorly written to do the job. Cardboard characters, a flimsy plot (partly stolen from Harry Potter and the Dungeons and Dragons RPG games), a lack of mood and suspense, and very mediocre writing make this a disappointing read. It's the first part of a trilogy about a young slum girl, Sonea, who discovers she has magic"

I often thought there should be more action in this story or at least not be over 400 pages long most of the pages did feel like filler. I will read the series because I'm interested enough to find out the bits that were left hanging in this book. What i enjoyed most was the world the author has created, I do like to see a world created where the a"
3913,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,"Actual rating: 3.5 stars My main issue with this book is the lack of female characters (there is one?!?!) Also, i don't know if I'm being pedantic but ""the healing arts are the main discipline chosen by women"" annoyed me more than a little, why aren't the Warrior arts being dominated by women?! Also, the main female character constantly relied on men to help her, it annoyed me that she never seemed to make a decision for herself - like ever! The writing and the storyline were both phenomenal though."
3916,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,"A deceptively simple start to a great high fantasy trilogy - one of my favorites. It's not epic, so it lacks a world-wide sense of peril and urgency. Instead, this builds the world (at this point just a city) and characters and mainly sets the stage. It's a low-key start that might not appeal to everyone. Consider this an introduction and hurry on to enjoy the rest."

3929,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,5,I loved this book. Excellent story in a beautifully created world.
3931,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,"Certainly better than Priestess of the White, it was faster and more engaging. Add to that, Sonea wasn't nearly as frustrating as Auraya."
3933,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,"After Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter I found myself in a void of good fantasy books. Thus, I was skeptical whether Trudi Canavan’s first trilogy was able to fill my expectations. However, the first paragraphs instantly drew me into the story. Now, eight years and ten re-reads later, I’ve reached a point at which I can discuss the books’ strengths and weaknesses despite my love for them. Being a fan doesn’t mean to switch off my brains. The story Each year the King drives out beggars and vagran"

And the series is one of my favourite series of all time, up there with Trudi Canavan’s other series, Lord of the Rings , Memory, Sorrow and Thorn , Graceling Realm , Shadow of the Bear , Empire Trilogy , Deathstalker Saga , Deltora Quest , Jane Austens books, various historical fictions and last but definitely not least, Harry Potter . So yeah, whatever, you get the picture. To me, this series is pretty damn good. The Magicians Guild is a relatively short read, you can definitely r"

This poses a problem to the Magicians’ Guild and the ruling class, for no magicians can live outside of the Guild’s rule. This fast paced story follows Sonea’s journey from realising she has magic to evading the Guild to finally having to decide whether she wants to join them or not. There’s lots of action, danger and intrigue. But – having the story told from four different points of view instead of just Sonea’s sometimes s"
3940,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,"There was quite a lot to like about this book, once I realised that it was set in a society where the inequity gulf between rich and poor has become even worse than in our ""real world"" and that the protagonist was one of the poor people. The beginning was well plotted, with all sorts of philosophical and economic differences shown between people on both sides of the fence and at that point I have to admit I was expecting a much more complex book than it ended up being. A few chapters in it felt"
3941,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,2,"Actual Rating : 2.5 This is a very up and down for me book. It started out good, then quickly went down, then steadily made it's way up and then so on so forth. I don't know if it was the writing that made this one hard for me to get through or if it was the story itself. I'm honestly very torn about it. By the ending of it, I've (surprisingly) decided to pick up the second book and see if it is any better than the first one. It ends with an interesting cliff hanger and the consecutive books will h"
3942,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,2,"I kept wanting more from this book, for something to happen, for the stakes to rise, for there to be some REAL consequences to the conflicts, but none came. The story wasn't entirely bad, nor the writing, but I didn't feel emotionally connected to the main character or any of the conflict really. It was like casually observing a mildly interesting story that was set in a mildly interesting world. I liked that it jumped from different POVs. Had it stayed in Sonea's throughout the entire story, I"
3945,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,2,"Underwhelming.... You keep waiting for something interesting to happen and it does only at the end and transpires exactly as you would expect... The details are nicely done, is easy to read but it feels like all there is to the book is the tiny details. It's light reading and perhaps good for tentative first steps into magic/fantasy literature for a teenage girl, but not for a grown-up I think."
3946,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,2,"onedimensional characters, easily predictable storyline, infantile magic. But anyway; a kind of comfortable read. I like the theme and the setting. Seems harsh not to give it more than 2 stars, but it really isnt above mediocre. Still I think I might try reading the second book in the trilogy. Partly because Ive already bought it, and partly to see if I got surprises ahead."
3947,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,"This first book tells the story of Sonea, a young girl who discovers her talent for magic. This being unusual she is pursued by the powerful magician's guild, and asked to join. This book has all the typical fantasy tropes, but a solid and fast moving story. You will not find anything new here, but comfort in a solid fantasy series first entry."
3948,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,The characters were too shallow for me to truly care about their shenanigans. I wasn't sure if I should continue until the end but I'm glad I did. The plot definitely picked up in the last half but it still wasn't a great plot twist or particularly gripping.
3949,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,5,"An excellent book for young adults! I loved reading this story of Magicians living in a class-based society. Similar, in a way to the class-based society of ""A Game of Thrones"" - and offering teens to contemplate the structure of society, and social inequality - but without all the graphic violence and sexual themes! I also really loved that the protagonist of the book is a young female. It's so great to see more of this in literature, especially as this is a book I think boys would really enjoy"
3951,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,An imaginative world with magic at every corner. I read this 4-5 months so my opinion is somewhat diluted as a result. I'm sure it would have been a 4 stars had I read it all in a month. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy.
3952,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,"This was a book/series that first got me into this genre. To be honest it does start off a bit too slowly for my liking, but stick with it! It’s a series that only gets better and is a series I love to come back to time and again."
3955,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,5,"Still love this book so much that I flew through it. It was a tad slower than I remember, but I still enjoyed it a heck of a lot."
3958,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,"It was a slow read the first 200 pages, but then it became really good"
3959,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,"It is a lovely series with great magic, big intrigues and a strong female lead. I absolutely recommend reading these books."
3960,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,5,"Really enjoyed it might of been filled with some tropes but all the ones I love a magic school, someone with great power and a all powerful bad guy. It was great fun and well written The first part of the book was slower paced but picked up in the middle."
3961,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,"Not a masterpiece of the genre but still a fun read. The narrative is a bit linear, it needs more character development and there is very little world building so far; however there is a great deal of potential for growth and expansion within the story. The writing is smooth and there is a good flow throughout the book. The main protagonists are likeable and I think the book is promising as the first in the trilogy. It was an easy and enjoyable to read and I have no hesitation in moving straight"
3963,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,"CARE SPOILERS IN REVIEW When I started reading this book, I had very high hopes. I love reading about distant fantasy worlds filled with magic, intricate plots and complex characters. Even better if said world has an elaborate social structure hopefully somewhat reflective of problems in our own society. The Magician's Guild has all of these things, and none. The story takes place in a fantasy world, but you barely explore said world . The world feels small, and you never really get the feeling th"
3964,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,"I am very ambivalent about the first installment of this series. I will probably read the whole trilogy, but there were so many illogical points in this book, I very nearly gave up on it altogether. There is a decent foundation, an interesting world and a promising plot, but the execution, the main character and the pacing are sometimes so off it’s almost artistic. Canavan does have a gift for words but the plot does not hold up to the style, because the whole book, all 500+ pages are more of an"
3967,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,5,"I have really enjoyed this book! As a book intended for young adults I was quite surprised by this book and layer or tow of complexity. It has great characters, an intriguing plot and a simple but effective magic system, I am looking forward to reading some more! A full review review will be on my blog soon"
3968,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,Very good at the start and the end but the middle was quite slow
3969,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,5,I was recommended the The Black Magician trilogy by a friend whilst we were in school and finally got around to reading the first in the series Magicians’ Guild last year (and finally reviewed it today). It was a good recommendation as I have really enjoyed the series as a whole. This particular book is not the strongest in the trilogy but it still kept me thoroughly entertained and did not take me long to read. I was actually a little surprised to see all of the negative reviews on here as this
3970,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,2,"As a child of the slums, Sonea despises the magicians. How could she feel differently, when once a year they purge her neighborhood of its poorest (and therefore least desirable) members? Everything changes when Sonea discovers that she can do magic, making her one of the people she most despises. When the magicians discover her existence, they launch a massive manhunt to track her down before her untrained powers become too dangerous. With no place to turn, Sonea is forced to turn to The Thieve"
3971,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,"I wanted to love this book and, as it is, I rather enjoyed it. It was just good enough to make me read the next two. I recommend it, if only because the next two are actually quite good. The main complaint I have about this book is that it had the potential for more . It feels as though this is just the first book of a trilogy. Its sole purpose is to precede the other two books. The pacing is fine at first -- in the very first chapter, Sonea performs the bit of magic which sends the Guild looking"
3973,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,"I liked the books. I read all three of the trilogy in less than a week. It kept my interest. Not real intricate but I was looking for something light but not too simple and it fit the bill perfectly. It has interesting characters and likable ones; and the opposite - the evil ones. Some books let you see, in your mind, what is going on: the scenery, the feelings, etc. Her writing did that for me. I would definitely read something by her again."
3974,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,1,"""Sonea, we must talk to each other,"" he said gently. ""There is a power in you that, whether you want it or not, you must learn to control. If you do not, it will kill you."" Yeah, Sonea. You've seen what your fucking powers can do and how it can obliterate your surrounding but please go ahead and bite the damn hand that feeds you. I bought this book years ago by choice because cover looks cool and the premise sounded fun. Five chapters in, I realize its not my cup of tea. Years later, I have to r"

She has been brought up to hate the Magician’s Guild and everything they stand for but she may need their help to avoid destroying herself and the world around her. Once safely in the confines of the Guild she beings to learn that maybe not everything she has heard about them is true, but who should she trust and what dark secrets are being kept within the Gui"
3983,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,"When I got this book from a friend I hadn't heard anything of this book. But when I read the synopsis I was intrigued so I began reading and I really enjoyed it. Sonea is a young girl who discovers that she has magic inside her. In the first part I have the feeling she's a little bit helpless but in the second part she turns out to be a strong and intelligent character. What I really like about her is that she's so down to earth. She's very realistic, doesn't have fantasies and doesn't expect mor"
3984,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,1,"I'm not impressed. I'm actually disappointed. The Magicians' Guild is a story of magic and mystery. There is darkness and great evil, but there is a interesting tale and a manhunt here, a sort of adventure. It has so much potential, but it is all wasted. All of it. Well, mostly wasted. Don't get my words wrong, but the book could have been better and it isn't. It isn't good enough. It isn't good as it is supposed to be, and it isn't as good as it could had been. Not. Good. Enough. The main chara"
3985,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,"I rate this 3.5. Fantasy is one of favourite genres. I love being taken to another world. The Magicians' Guild, the first of The Black Magician trilogy, by Trudi Canavan, is a fantasy with the typical elements - magic, the good ones, the bad ones and the really bad ones, a conflict that makes things difficult for the protagonist, a minor love interest, attempt to create another world... The class difference in Kyralia is WIDE and vehement, and very clearly portrayed through the doubts Sonea has"
3989,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,"This book really took me back to old-school Mercedes Lackey. It features a determined orphan girl with special powers who must find her place and in the process changes everything. The college where much of the action takes place organizes students' area of study by color coding, Healers wear green and Mages perform the Truth spell. No mysterious spirit horses though, and the mechanics of the magic are more Name of the Wind than Arrows of the Queen. It has a bit more grit where required. Luckily"
3990,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,"Drawn to The Black Magician Trilogy by their simplistic but eye-catching covers and by the fact that I had yet to venture into the fantasy genre, I stumbled upon Trudi Canavan's gripping trilogy entirely by chance; I had no idea that, later on, Canavan would become one of my favourite authors. The Magician's Guild , the first book in the trilogy, centers around the character of Sonea as her world is turned upside down by the discovery that she harbors strong, magical powers. In a world where magi"

During my christmas shopping i saw this book and read the blurb, which was no better than any other blurb i have read. However i felt myself drawn to this book enough to purchase it, believing i would get bored after the first 10 pages, and thank god i did.

3993,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,"2.5ish?? I am no expert in analyzing prose nor technique. When i rate, large percentage is based on how I feel about the story and the characters. Okay, with that being said I was a little disappointed with this book. I was expecting more action I guess and what I got was 50% hide and seek, 10% ridiculous skepticism, 15% posturing, and all right maybe about 25% action. It almost bored me to tears. I liked the first quarter of the book but when I passed the halfway mark and they were still searchi"
3994,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,5,"This book was recommended to me by a friend who was completely obsessed with the series. I am friends with people who don't kid about their obessions. No joke, she went on about this book for 4 hours. Straight. I figured ""I had better start reading this book before she starts threatening me or something,"" so I picked up a copy at the library. Now I understand why she was so obsessed. The beginning I found cliche, and I really wanted to put the book down. Don't. It is definitely worth it. I got suck"
3995,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,5,The book is divided into two parts. Part one tells the story of Sonea from the slums (a dweller) they are purged from the city every year by Magicians. Magicians are the enemy and they are never seen to do anything good for the commoners. Sonea gets dragged to the purge and she throws a stone at the magical barrier what she doesn't realise is that she puts all her emotion into it and therefore breaks the barrier and has done magic. This is an accident. The adventure begins when she discovers tha
3997,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,"This book has been on my goodreads shelf since pretty much the beginning of time... so why on earth have I been wasting my time with every other poorly-constructed dystopian world instead of reading this? I have absolutely no excuse: I own a copy, it's won practically every award going, and all my reviewer friends have been constantly singing its praises. Perhaps I am way more influenced by title and cover than I like to admit - though there's nothing actually wrong with either, I still feel li"
3998,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,5,"This is one of the almost perfect books written for young adults. It is an exciting story that will keep you turning the pages, but it also makes you think about the world we live in. It is a Newbery and Printz honor book and winner of the National Book Award. In the House of the Scorpion, Nancy Farmer tells the story of Matt, the clone of 142-year-old El Patron, dictator of Opium, a country between the United States and Aztlan. In Opium, clones have one purpose, to extend the lives of those whos"
3999,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,3,"A really hit and miss book, with some terrific ideas and terrible plotting. The main character, Matt, is a clone of the world's biggest drug kingpin, the 140+ year-old El Patron. Matt lives in El Patron's sprawling estate and is hated by most of the residents there, aside from his care-taker Celia and El Patron himself, who is raising Matt for his own sinister reasons. Soon, these reasons are revealed and Matt's only hope is to escape. This felt like it should have been at least twice as long. The"
4000,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,"The House of the Scorpion is really unlike any YA/middle grade book I've ever read. It's extremely philosophical and thought-provoking, covering topics of the soul, identity, and human rights in a very intriguing way. It takes place in some distant future where there is a land between the U.S. and Mexico that grows poppies for opium. The main character Matt is a clone of the leader of the nation named El Patron. El Patron seems kind and generous, giving his clone an education and privileges that"

I have no idea why I've been avoiding The House of the Scorpion for so long. Just look at its accolades - National Book Award Winner, Printz Honoree, Newbery Honoree. It practically has my name written on it. But, is The House of the Scorpion worth such an overwhelming acclaim though? I'd say, its first 215 pages and the last 20 are (ebook edition). The first two thirds of the book are riveting. This story is not just"

4003,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,1,"I HATED IT, and hated it on so many levels I truly do not know where to begin. First of all, I will acknowledge one aspect of the story that I found positive. This is the story of Matt, a clone. Matt is raised in a shack on the opium plantation of drug lord, El Patron. He is El Patron's clone, grown for the purpose of being spare body parts for El Patron. In this world (the near future), clones are considered property, livestock. The embroyos are implanted in cows, so the people of this world hav"
4005,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,3,"Recommended to me by my teenaged son, the book had a promising start and an interesting middle, but it all kind of fell apart towards the end and finished with a very unsatisfying ending. I liked the ideas presented about prejudice and predetermination vs. self-determination, and about the relative values of evil. The book is chock-full of evil-doers, some of whom are despicable, some of whom are loved, and one, the most interesting character of them all, Tam Lin, who is a compelling mixture of"

It is a young adult book about, I kid you not, every social policy and -ism you can think of--drugs, slavery, cloning, classism, socialism, EVERYTHING 2. I read all 400 or something pages in a day 3. The story is really unique and I wasn't really sure what was going to happen Anyways, it is basically the story of the clone of the biggest drug lord in a country solely made up of drug farms. A few people on the book's goodreads page mentioned that the writing was not ama"
4007,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,"But underneath Matt felt a hollowness. He understood he was only a photograph of a human, and that meat he wasn’t really important. Photographs could lie forgotten in drawers for years. They could be thrown away. You know that moment just before you’ve entirely woken up, when you’re dreaming, but you’re conscious that you’re dreaming, so you’re hovering somewhere between sleep and wakefulness?

4008,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,5,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. See the RACK of medals of the cover of this book? A friend told me she felt this novel changed the face of science-fiction. High praise indeed. I didn't buy the hype, and still have issues with the extremely slow start of this novel. It has been sitting on my desk for almost two years (no lie) and I finally read it.

It's chockfull of great issues to be explored in class discussions and writing assignments. Best of all, it is a compelling story that will definitely engage even our more reluctant readers. In addition to that, I enjoyed it personally. Farmer creates a dystopian world that is believable due to the fact that it is based on so many of the issues we are dealing with to"
4011,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,"This book was very slow and boring at the beginning, but as I went on I started really enjoying it. I recommend it for people, but if you do decide to read it give it time before you decide you don't like it."
4013,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,5,"Initial reaction: I'm pretty much at a loss for words at this point in time because I didn't expect this story to grip me as much as it did. Following Matt's journey in the course of this book was one full of many ups and downs, tragedies as well as triumphs, and I honestly haven't come across many MG/YA dystopian novels that were as well done as this. Full review: Nancy Farmer's ""The House of the Scorpion"" was a story that took years for me to pick up since its original publication date. Seriousl"

I guess I kind of like reading anyone who really has the feel of a setting, and I think Nancy Farmer has that here. This was desolate and full of desert flowers, and just enough mystery and elusive environmental contamination to set the scene for a lovely dystopian world. This was a wonderful, scary, heartwarming, chilling, inspiring story. While I was reading this, I ke"
4015,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,5,"That was amazing. Why hadn’t I heard of this award winning book? The House of the Scorpion by Nancy Farmer absolutely captivated me. I read it in about a day and could not put it down. Essentially it’s a middle school to young adult book but the beauty of it is that it can be read on so many levels that anyone from about age 12 and up can get something out of this book. The book touches upon many themes: religion, politics, ethics, cloning, slavery, the drug trade, corruption and probably a few o"
4016,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,5,"First read this in 2004 when my daughters were in middle school. It’s an excellent young adult novel about a young man, Matt, who discovers he is ‘clone’ in a futuristic society somewhere between America and Mexico. How Matt—cloned to be the spare ‘parts’ for a wealthy elderly man—grows into adolescence and discovers the truth of his identity, learns who his friends and foes are, the rules of the system in which he lives and how to survive is an incredible story. It really helps you look at huma"

I also need to mention that the real rating for this book is 3.5 stars as it is better than the majority of the books I rated with 3 stars, but it does not quite reach 4-star rating. I never felt more strongly about having 0.5 star rating on Goodreads since I joined it.

I had forgotten how intensely and wonderfully creative this book was. I had forgotten the beauty of the language used in it. The mysteries of Matt's relationship with El Patron. The nickname he is called, mi vida - my life - which has so much more meaning than even he realizes. The subplots of this book are extensive and diverse. Scientific experiments, drug dealing, juvenile espionage, child imprisonment, and"

4023,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,"Going into this book, I was not all that excited because I normally don't read Sci-Fi books. When I started reading I was getting reeled in by the authors use of figurative language and suspense buildup. I was attached to certain characters and by the end of the book I felt like Tam Lin and I were old friends. This book is a great read for you if you enjoy reading about struggles, setbacks and rewards. House of the Scorpion has a little bit of all of those."

The original Matteo Alacran, also known as El Patron, was a power-hungry drug-dealer that created an evil empire filled with eejits, or people that have no will. Due to Matt being a clone, he is always treated differently – usually for the worse. He is trapped in the Alacran estate, a large mansion filled with people that have a personal distaste for him.

While this story is futuristic and science fiction it does deal with the century old questions of power, human relationships, and empathy for mankind. The setting takes place between Arizona and Northern Mexico. It prompted me to do a little research on the Ajo Mountains and salt mines as the author repeatedly referred to them. Matt, the protago"
4027,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,5,House of the Scorpion was a very good book in my opinion. I liked how even though Matt was a clone he still tried to live like anyone else would. When I read this book I felt a lot of sympathy for him because everyone had to think of him as a beast. I felt bad about the process that was done to make Matt. Later on Matt is treated better as the book goes on because people learn to accept Matt. I think the use of eejits is terrible. Its not fair to basically lose somebody just to get more work don

4032,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,2,"This book is exactly why many critics do not respect Young Adult Fiction as a genre. It won three different prestigious awards and the writing is barely passable. A work of literature this is not. The characters are flat, and while the story is somewhat fresh, the plotting is mostly predictable. The ending is neat and sappy. Instead of flashes of brilliant writing, we get flashes of clumsy writing and poor dialogue. I suspect it is award winning because it asks some interesting questions about i"

It definitely speaks to adolescent boys with its mixture of brainy science and adventure. It is also timely since it incorporates aspects of DNA and cloning into the plot.

Let me try my best though, to say what I thought about this incredible masterpiece. Yeah – very telling I know, but this one’s really a masterpiece. First the characters – I loved Matt’s character. I was with him the whole time reading the book – was rooting for this kid who’s been cloned from the most powerful man in this dysto"
4038,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,2,"I read this as a possible choice to get a friend who's trying out reading some YA books in Spanish as he learns more, especially since one of the guys from my YA Literature class read it for a project we had to do, and said it was one of the best books he'd ever read. Perhaps his summary (without the ending, of course) spoiled the most novel parts of the book for me - the particulars of the dystopian setting, Matt's identity and destiny - but I was actually disappointed upon finishing this, and"
4039,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,2,"2.5 out of 5 Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I'm quite disappointed. Although The House of the Scorpion raises some interesting, thought-provoking question about humanity, cloning, slavery, free will, individuality, agency, etc., the exploration of these topics lacks depth. Also, the plot is stretched out, and the writing is a bit repetitive, making this book a rather tedious read. Unfortunately, I believe The House of the Scorpion would be stronger without its last third, which seems"

4041,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,3,"For the first half of The House of the Scorpion I found myself riveted: there’s a lot of tension derived from the collision course of Matt’s sole purpose for existing and El Patron’s failing health, but after that conflict gets rather offhandedly resolved a little over half way through the book the story takes some kind of odd 1984 detour and rounds out with a deus ex machina turn of events and a “Huh?” from yours truly. If you’re reading a spoiler review then let’s assume you’ve read the book"
4042,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,3,"I enjoyed the fact that Nancy Farmer brought up some very pertinent issues through this novel—cloning, drugs, and finding a sense of belonging. Through Matt’s experience as a clone in Opium, a place where he is looked down upon by almost everyone, the reader identifies with his struggles and is rooting for him to find acceptance the whole way through the novel. The author’s setting of the book in a country based upon the drug industry allows a lot of room for discussion about the topic, as with t"
4043,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,5,"Before the story begins there was a list and brief description of each character and a family tree which was daunting, but the author masterfully introduced each of them and made them distinct and recognisable.

For the first few years of his life, he is sheltered and has little human contact except with his carer Celia. An unexpected visit from three children provokes"

It was one of the first books I remember reading that really made me think about the world. The idea of revisiting it as an adult made me nervous, but ultimately, I think it still holds up as a thought-provoking story, especially considering the intended audience. I think this book could lead to some interesting discussions about greed, humanity, politics, etc. in a junior high English class. Obviously, since the first time I read t"
4045,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,2,"Matt is a boy who was ""harvested"" as a clone. At first I did not like the book that much because it was very slow in some parts like when he is in the locked room for four months because of Rosa. When Matt met the original Matteo Alcran (Èl Patron), that is when I started to really like the book because Matt felt as if he was a real person with Èl Patron because all of the servants and the rest of the Alcran family had to respect him. That part really stood out to me because as long as Matt can"
4046,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,"In the beginning, I wasn't very excited to read this book. However, as I started to get further in the book, I realized that this book was very interesting and disturbing at the same time. This book made me feel angry at El Patrón and because of how Matt and the eejits were treated, sympathetic towards them as well as the orphans, and hopeful when Matt decided to take on the challenge of breaking down the Opium Empire. I recommend this book to Sci Fi lovers, and if you don't generally read this"
4047,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,"I'm slowly working my way through a stack of recommendation from one of the YA librarians where I work, and so far The House of the Schorpion is my favorite. The near-future world of depravity, deprivation and corruption Farmer has created is frighteningly real, and the characters are fully rounded and believable. Matt's slow coming-of-age is both languorous and tense, as he learns how to be who he is: first, a favored clone in the household of El Patrón and later, a full-fledged human being."
4048,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,3,"House of the scorpion is a decent book. I liked the description of the characters as well as the setting. Matt is a clone of el patron, a wealthy old man. By old I mean like 135+ years. Matt is treated poorly because he is not considered human. El patron teaches Matt how to run the drug empire. Through the story, we are taken through matt's life. He starts as a little kid and then we get introduced to his teen years.

In the beginning I was thinking ""Oh, I knew I wouldn't like this."" but then the author takes us through Matt's struggles and I was intrigued because I wanted to know what happened. I'm not really a science fiction type of person, but I kind of liked this book. I really enjoyed each characters development and how they matured or changed. I didn't like the ending. It was a little depressing."

It talked about a clone being born inside a cow. Like ???? But after, we decided to read this book and i'm glad... My first initial thought of this book was ""meh, its okay."" I wasn't a fan of how the storyline was being made, and the it confused me even more when the first page was about a cow, then the next three were about a boy, living with Celia,"

It is action packed and full of suspense. It always throws a twist or turn when you think you understand what’s happening. I think that is 5 star book, an example of what all books should be.

I’ve always meant to read this since it’s an award winning YA dystopia novel. I wasn’t disappointed after finally getting to it. It reads well and gives food for thought. I really liked how the book portrayed the moral development of the main character, who is a clone. The book is an easy choice for junior high kids because there is no language or sex, but it’s edgy enough to keep a reluctant reader’s interest. However,"
4063,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,I personal do not like dystopian fictions but this book was pretty good. Although I know this book is a sequel I thought where the author left me was very odd and because of it I may have to read next one because I can't stand the suspense which does work to the authors benefit. I really thought the change you see in Matt as a character was really thought out and well written by the author. I found the concept of El Patron creepy and I had a tough time staying focused sometimes and I would lose

Celia loves and cares for Matt teaching him the rights and wrongs of the world and what it contains. Matt later meets a special character named El Patron and discovers who he really is. Matt is told where he came from and his many questions are answered by the people around him. As Matt grows up a tragedy leads him to being his own person. Will he survive if everyone discovers what he really is?
4065,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,3,"I was not a fan of this one. It seemed boring and hard to follow. Way too many characters at once. I did enjoy the concept on how they made Maria and Matt very immature at a young age. As annoying as it was and how much I wanted to strangle both of them, it shows realism. Overall, not my cup tea."

The thing is, it didn't feel like too much happened in this book. It felt like an intro to the other book, a slow ass intro.

Its a surprisingly thought-provoking YA book which touches upon the sociological/ethical implications of drug trade, illegal immigration, communism, environmental pollution, cloning, etc. In a way, it reminded me of The Giver by Lois Lowry -- a book written for younger audiences which manages to also have a surprising level of depth and provide an interesting social commentary -- making fo"

I picked this book up at the Tucson Festival of Books a few years ago because I heard Farmer speak on a panel and the book sounded interested. What’s stuck with me these years later is that Farmer is of the mind that it’s an author’s duty to basically moralize and teach a lesson to their readers. I am not of this opinion and I remember Ilsa Bick, the author who I was there to see, saying the same thing. So going into SCORPION I expected it to be on the pre"

I enjoy a good dystopian novel, especially YA for some reason, and this one is very well done. The story is engaging, which kept me reading while I should have been doing other things.

It was an intriguing dystopian premise, which I normally love, but the plot was all over the place and the characters were one-dimensional and irritating. The dialogue was completely unrealistic and silly and there were several grammatical errors that drove me batty. Worst of all I was soooo bored for most of the book. Skip this!"
4103,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,"The novel The House of the Scorpion by Nancy Farmer I thought had a good story but got a little boring at parts. I felt that the book was pretty good up until he tries to run away from the farm. After that, I felt that rest of the book was rushed. The beginning really grabs the readers attention and makes you feel sympathy for Matt. I would recommend this book to most people who like sci-fi books."
4104,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,3,"Totally engrossing teen SF. Clones, drug dealing empires, forced labor camps, survivalism -- what more could a teenage boy want? The female characters are kind of boring and pretty stereotypical, but the intriguing premise and the fast-paced storytelling made it possible for me to overlook this flaw."
4105,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,3,"I was lured in by the cover. Unfortunately, the pacing was excruciatingly slow and I almost gave up on the book. I liked Matt and Maria though. I liked their character growth and their slow-budding romance. Lucky for me the excitement started halfway through and got me itching for more. Overall I liked the book and I will read the next installment."
4106,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,3,"This book I would say was OK. It was not to interesting but at the same time it was just below fantastic. Anyway, Matt is a clone born from a cow. Matt is not accepted into the world by most people except for El Patron and Maria. Matt later finds out he is not a clone for good but for evil. Read the book to find out what Matt is used for."
4107,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,5,"This was one of my favorite books in middle school, and it's no less amazing now that I reread it for my class. The world that El Patron controls, in which Matt lives, is frighteningly stifling yet exciting. An absorbing story while at the same time bringing up interesting issues surrounding cloning, power, and its effect on humanity's future and the definition of identity and humanity."
4108,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,5,"My students have said that it is a bit slow in parts but I have encouraged them to persevere and they're grateful. This is a compelling tale, but it's also a fascinating platform for exploring the implications of ideologies from Friedman style economics to communism. A wonderful Middle School book."
4109,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,"It is about clones which attracts me and my tuition teacher recommended it to me. I started to read the book and it seems interesting. Even it’s written some times ago, the story illustrated seems possible and it could be a potential future. May make me think about the future."
4110,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,Such an good story. It's interesting to think that Farmer wrote this before dystonia-books was a big thing and I really enjoyed it. I kind of feel bad for Matt - because he grow up just for one purpose. :(
4111,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,"This book literally takes you on the longest journey and its the end where the most happens, which i think people mistake for being a really slow book which it was not.So happy i read this because the characters were pretty amazing."
4112,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,"This book was totally awesome and different. I loved the way the story slowly revealed, I loved the Mexican setting, I loved all the plot twists and turns and I loved the main characters. Recommended."
4113,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,I thought the book was pretty good. I like the adventure i went on with Matt and his life.
4114,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,5,What an interesting book with so many unexpected twists and turns. I cannot wait to teach this book to my students! I am cooking some good plans....

4117,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,"I picked this book up blind at the recommendation of my son. The brief description I'd been given didn't provide much insight into what I should expect. Having recently read Bless Me, Ultima by Anaya, I was expecting something along similar lines. What I found was both strikingly different and oddly similar. Characters Our main character, Matt Alacran, is a clone (something I didn't know before reading, but it's introduced early on, so I'm not really spoiling anything by saying that). He's a clo"
4118,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,1,"""The House of the Scorpion"" is, without a doubt, the worst book I have ever read. Where do I even begin with this book? The plot of the story was terribly boring. The exposition of the story doesn't succeed in building character background, although there were PLENTY of opportunities to do so in the 37 chapters composing this book. I found myself confusing character traits with characters that had already DIED due to the lack of explanation. The climax- if you can call it that- is written in the"
4119,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,The House of the Scorpion was a great read. The funny part about this book is that I now remember that I started reading it sometime in middle school and I never understood the story behind it and eventually just gave up. It is a great feeling of accomplishment to finally finish something from long long ago and I get the story now!! I gave this book 4 stars because the character Matt changed so much during this book and I think what enticed me so much was seeing him struggle to find out who he w
4120,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,"This book is eye-opening and heart-wrenching all at the same time. This book has cloning advances in it which makes the characters act certain ways, if you are a clone you are most likely an eejit which is basically when they destroy your brain so you are 'stupid' but because of Matt being Matteo Alacran's, the most powerful drug lord in all of Opium, clone. When Matt is found and then realizes he is a clone he notices that the kids who found him now treated him like a beast, expect Maria. As Ma"
4121,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,3,"There’s corners everywhere around the world. We don’t notice them. But that’s where the truth hides, and sometimes you need to be the one to accept it and listen to the hidden secrets. In the book “The house of the scorpion”, I noticed a few similarities in “Speak”. Both books created the main protagonist being someone who was an outcast. Matt was marked by his difference in ways he doesn’t even suspect. Melinda was a girl who was an outcast because she always lived in the dark side, thinking sh"
4122,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,3,"I guess this is a 3.5, I just expected to like this book so much more than I did. The description sounded awesome, clones harvested from cows to provide body parts to a 140 year old drug lord? That sounds interesting and exciting and like it would deal with all kinds of ethical and medical problems. But it was more about the day to day life of Matt and El Patron's family than anything. And then later, its somehow about communism in a dystopian Mexico and child labor. Even the eejits were potenti"

4126,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,5,"I'll admit, I haven't been reading very often as of late. I only finished a single book last, which is strange considering my average is at least 3. I'm happy to say that The House of the Scorpion really got me into high gear when it comes to reading. I checked this book out on a Monday and had it done on Wednesday, then I checked out the sequel on Wednesday, and had it finished the next day. The House of the Scorpion is such an interesting book, and it doesn't follow the tropes of other young ad"
4127,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,5,"I would recommend this book to high school boys because it tells a darker story that boys this age would be more interested in. In the book the main character, Matt, is a clone of El Patrón. El Patron tries to use Matt for his organs so that El Patron can stay alive forever to love the lives his siblings never got the chance to live. Throughout the book El Patron shows his passion for Matt but soon turns on him and wants to kill him. The House of the Scorpion is a book that shows the themes pass"
4128,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,"I enjoyed The House of the Scorpion a lot! I liked how it went through each stage of life and had surprises throughout the story. I think that this book is most accurately age appropriate for kids 12 and up. It introduces the reality of drugs, cloning, and includes a romantic friendship. I like the overall message that even though El Patron was a drug lord, Matt came back and wanted to fix all of the damage that El Patron had made. It's also an important message to readers that there needs to b"
4129,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,3,The House of the Scorpion by Nancy Farmer dives deep into the genre of adventure and fear. The story starts out really slow with Matteo Alcrán stuck in a house with his caretaker Celia. Events happened and Matteo was transported to the big house where he was to live in a dungeon for about 80 pages of the book. After he gets out and earns his freedom he is treated not so nicely by the other people in the big house. Matteo eventually escapes to Mexico where he finds his freedom. This author does a
4130,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,"Admittedly, I thought this would be a 3-star book for me at first. While I understand that this is a young adult genre, I still felt like the first half was too heavy on the spoon-feeding. But the premise was fascinating and the characters–Matt, Maria, Celia, and Tam Lin–kept me going. Sure enough, the turn of events towards the second half pushed me over to the 4-star camp. This is a story, told from the perspective of a clone, with an irresistible heart and an ending that I loved. I just wish"
4131,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,5,"The novel, The House of The Scorpion, written by Nancy Farmer, is a utopia and dystopia science fiction book. The House of The Scorpion takes place in the not so distant future. There are two new countries in North America, the remaining are still just as different. These two countries are called Aztlan, formerly called Mexico about one hundred years ago, and the land of Opium. Opium and Aztlan are where the story takes place. Aztlan is a wealthy country that is full of rich culture and a safe h"
4132,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,"A dystopian novel that doesn’t read like a plagiarized version of The Hunger Games or The Giver. A unique storyline that is captivating from the first chapter. The characters are interesting, endearing, and even irritating in a good way. There is no foul language or are no sexual references. The author created a fast moving, clever novel that I could not put down. The author did so without resorting the cheap tactics of foul language and sex that authors with less talent and creativity often res"
4133,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,"The House of the Scorpion was not my favorite book. However, I liked the idea of the book. Matt was a clone of a guy named El Patron who is the ruler of the world they live in. There is a lot of characterization, and they have strengths and weaknesses. I thought Matt grew a lot as a character; he was well developed throughout the story. The plot tells a good story and would be a appropriate for a 5th to middle school age. The idea of vampires, clones, hovercraft, and the harvesting of organs is a"
4134,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,"3.6 stars. Personally, I haven’t read a lot of science fiction, so I don’t have very specific expectations. This book was kind of like a sci-fi novel about clones and drugs with a few of the qualities of a thriller spun in towards the end. Above all, it was pretty confusing, so, read it for yourself."
4135,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,"I had no idea how much I was going to like this book. It was recommended to me by someone who does not like to read - I figured it had to be a pretty good book for him to have read it. I love that we get to hear from Matt's point of view as he grows up, starting at 6 years old. It addresses problems of the drug trade, including slave labor, through the dystopian genre. It also talks about how people are dehumanized. A really excellent read."
4136,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,5,"A re-read for me! Love this book a lot. Gripping SF story about a clone of a drug lord. I couldn't put it down even though I'd read it before! Content notes: child abuse, animal abuse and death, human rights abuses, references to drugs and alcohol"
4137,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,3,"Read this because Cohen's class did and he talked about it nonstop. Glad I did, because the scene where Maria is forced to kiss Matt against her will is pretty rapey. We discussed that at length. I wonder if it was discussed in class at all."
4138,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,"I was really confused if I should give this book a 3 or 4 stars because as I started the first half of the book, I was reaaaaallllllyy thrilled and had mixed emotions towards the characters. I just hate what happened to tam lin although it is reasonable :-------((((("
4139,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,3,"Uhhhh...where was the story line? I feel like this book was just a whole bunch of info-dropping and no action. I know there's a second book, but I don't know if I want to read it because this was a first book??? Like honestly there wasn't much plot at aaaall."
4140,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,There's a reason it won so many awards.
4141,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,5,This was my favorite book growing up
4142,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,5,Futuristic story set in Mexico about a clone.....definitely unlike anything I've ever read! Very unique and done very well!
4143,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,5,loved the way it ended
4144,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,5,"Matteo Alacran is a clone. Livestock. Worthless. He is the clone of the overlord of Opium, a strip of land in between America and Mexico (now called Aztlan). A person so powerful he can break the law. A person who only is known to Matt as ""El Patron"". House of the Scorpion is good because of the setting, but it is amazing because of its characters and tension. It's also about my reading level, so that's nice as well."
4145,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,"I was terribly impressed by this when I first read it as a YSL at Balboa Branch Library! At this point in time, I'd have to reread it to remember the story."
4147,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,5,"This is the story of a boy who is a clone. Up to this point in history, all clones had been injected with a serum that makes them brain dead. But the man that had funded for his clone was powerful enough to make sure that his clone would live like any other person. Throughout the story Matt, the clone, learns about different types of people, people that are drunk with power, people that seem nice around other people but not around you, people that have the best intentions but end up leaving you."
4148,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,Good story. It reminded me of Southern Arizona with the setting and folklore. It felt like it could have been a young man’s story but for the futuristic sci fi. I guess that’s why it was so good. Real enough to believe it but also great fantasy fiction elements to keep it interesting.
4149,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,"Just finished this audiobook...interesting concept. I'm not sure if I would recommend the audio--the reader didn't quite get the different voices, which was kind of annoying when it came to Maria. Nonetheless, I really think the book touched upon some futurist but also current issues in the US."
4150,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,"I don't know where to begin with this book! It was fantastic! I suppose that I'll begin with the things I liked about it. Okay, so I really loved how unique this story was. I don't know how Nancy Farmer came up with the idea that a super rich (and evil) man harvested clones and then took their body parts to keep him alive. Then set this story in a corrupt, futuristic society or whatever it is... I mean, seriously. Absolutely brilliant! I loved Matt's character. He was so realistic with the good th"
4151,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,"Very interesting, science-based, futuristic YA novel that envisions a near future with clones. I liked the characters and the setting but like a lot of these planned sequel books, the ending was open ended. Worth a read if you like this genre."
4152,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,"As someone who gravitates towards scientific fiction, I found this book to be an easy read. Books such as this, that take place in a future where cloning is possible, capture my attention quickly. From a drug lord (El Patron) using clones to further his unnaturally long life, to the criticism clones face every day of their life, this is definitely an interesting read. My favorite character to analyze in this book is the main character, Matt. Matt is a clone created by El Patron who's sole purpos"
4153,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,I thought that this book was pretty good. When he was with Maria something interesting almost always happens. It kept you wanting to read more and a lot of the chapters ended with cliff hangers making me want to keep reading. This is good for people who want a idea for the future. It takes place in the future but makes it seem like the past.
4154,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,5,"This is the kind of book everyone should read in their life time. I love it so much I have so many stickers on almost every page. The author's world building skill is brilliant. I love Celia character so much. Everyone should have a Celia in their life! And don't get me started with Fidelito! He just brings joy to Matt's crazy life. He's so funny, I burst out laughing so many times because of him. It's worth a read."
4155,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,5,I loved this book. The plot of this book about a boy named Matteo who is a clone that this powerful drug dealer had made for so that he could live longer. Read more to find out. The genre is sci-fi.
4156,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,5,"Not Born but grown Matteo Alacran . Is a Clone of the most powerful man in Opium, El Patron. Matteo Alacran is not like any boy or clone though . Unlike most other clones matt is not dumb down he is a clone with a education. All This because of his Original Counterpart loves himself intern loves matt like his was will him. But clones are treated with no respect and Matt try to find himself and who he is if it is Negative or Positive. So to end this review I have to say that everyone should read"
4157,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,2,"Minor spoilers! I was so close to deciding not to finish this book. I did in the end, so I guess that's all that matters, but I have to say that I honestly didn't like The House of the Scorpion as much as everyone else did. I had read so many great reviews on the book but throughout reading it I was constantly thinking, ""Did we read the same book?"" I feel like we didn't. I will admit that the book had a lot of potential, I guess I can see why so many people liked it and why it won so many awards."

4159,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,"I have no idea why I've been avoiding The House of the Scorpion for so long. Just look at its accolades - National Book Award Winner, Printz Honoree, Newbery Honoree. It practically has my name written on it. I'd say the first two thirds of the book are riveting. This story is not just a clone story. Yes, it is horrifying in how it examines the (familiar) debate about a clone's humanity and soulless(ful)ness. Matt is a clone and is defined by people around him as livestock, a source of body part"

As a young child, Matteo lived in a farm house in Mexico, nestled next to a poppy field that spans as"
4164,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,5,"I definitely didn't expect to like this book so much. I was like ""this sounds fun and entertaining. Not a big deal."" Nope I was wrong. The amount of emotions I went through was ridiculous. I was happy, satisfied, angry, and sad (especially at the last part). The world building is spectacular and detailed unlike many YA novels lately-_- but one thing remains the same: the whiny bitchy girl romantic interest. I'll get to that later. Matt: my precious baby. He's seriously been hurt so much I'm fuck"

On the one hand Farmer brilliantly laces all sorts of ethics from social justice, to medical ethics, to economic justice without once being preachy. The characters she created were amazing and complex. There was a true sociopath in the novel, Tom, and a wide range of characters. If you're anything like me you'll love Tam Lin and Celia.

Of course, the endless chapters where Matt was just locked in a room with sand got a little boring, but whatever. I liked Maria, I hated Rosa, and I sympathized with"
4181,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,3,"I really liked the premise and the start of this book. I thought it was well paced, very entertaining and addressed some important social issues (prejudice, class consciousness, slavery). The writing was very good for the first 1/3-1/2, but then it got sloppy. I felt like after Matt met El Patron, things moved too quickly, the writing was much more expository rather than mysterious, and everything just got too convenient for me. When Matt attempts to escape just before El Patron dies, it was unbe"
4182,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,2,"The story... well, it wasn't so much a story as it was a giant character sketch. There were too many holes which sometimes were patched up with shoddy back story, and, frankly, it needed a better plot. This book was plain and boring. Matt Alacran, a boy who is the clone of El Patron, a powerful drug lord, grows up before our eyes. In the span of several years we witness the boy becoming a young teenager; however, we learn very little about Matt. This is disappointing because the story is partly t"

4186,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,3,I took about two weeks to read the book and it wasn't that great. I did like some parts while some felt like they were in an entirely different book. There were a lot of characters and some didn't really build on the story. Most of the lost boys had the same voice and I couldn't really tell who was who. I also didn't really enjoy the part in the orphanage because it was boring and repetitive. I was also kind of bored in the first two chapters. After Matt's arrival at the Alcarán mansion it got b
4187,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,5,"This is quite possibly my favorite science fiction type book of all time. I'm not sure I'd really classify it as sci-fi or young adult, although it is shelved that way. The characters are young people but the themes are universal. Setting is futuristic, post-apocalyptic maybe, or at least post modern. The book deals with cloning humans, something I've also written about with admittedly less grace. Although the topic makes this book science fiction, it read more like urban fantasy. The characters"
4188,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,"After hearing good things about this book from a friend, I decided to give it a try. Now, I'm not much for science fiction, so I was surprised that I enjoyed this book so much. This book is more dystopian than science fiction, which is probably why I loved it. Farmer paints a feasible and slightly disconcerting picture of North America a ways down the road from now. This novel actually was difficult to read for me in a few places--not for language or anything, but because of the subject matter."

Between glowing reviews on Goodreads and all the awards it’s received, I don’t know why I took so long getting around to reading The House of the Scorpion. The novel follows the tale of Matteo Alacran, a boy who was cloned from El Patron, drug lord and head of a country called Opium.

First, the good - the author has created a really interesting world, full of ideas and practices that young adults would enjoy discussing and pondering. Cloning, a country created for the purpose of drug production, illegal immigration, communism, and the basic good vs. bad. Most of the characters were so flat they could have been clones themselves, and I'm putting this with the stuff I liked because I think it was done intentionally, to make the aut"

The book contains slight romance so if your not into romance (even thought there is very little) then this book may not be the best for you. It contains action and suspense as well.

They weren't as enthralled as when I read The Hunger Games and Hatchet but they did stay interested. Part of the reason is that the book has some complex ideas and a lot of great imagery in the writing that they just didn't always get.

The book brings up some really interesting ideas about what it is to be human, cloning, slavery, but nothing really seems to be completely thought out or explained. Some of the characters are fairly well developed but others are very flat and one dimensional and others seem to really flip personalities. Maria for instance is a character that goes"

4210,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,"This was a very interesting book. Maybe it's because it's YA/Middle Grade from about 2002, which is long before YA was really very popular, or maybe it's because of the dystopian/Mexican setting, which was such a cool mixture (dystopians tend to be very middle-class-white-American-feeling).

4213,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,3,"This novel is an enjoyable read. I would class this as a sort of sci-fi / dystopian read as the world as we know it is mostly the same, except for the cloning issue. For me the most interesting theme that emerged in this read was that of 'judging' others - by appearances, labels they've been given or acquired, their abilities etc., and how do we become our own person, what do we see as worthwhile & valuable in life? We see in El Patron how powerful negative memories can be in shaping choices"

Sparhawk has a zero tolerance approach to BS which is immensely refreshing and enjoyabl"

I liked this first trilogy better than the second (Tamuli) but both are good if you're looking for something quick, light & entertaining. Sparhawk is a great character, a battered knight, but his horse Faran is my favorite. It's nice to see a horse as a character. More authors should do this."

The Elenium focuses on a Knight called Sparhawk and his travels to save his young and very beautiful queen, who is encased i"
4233,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"Solid fantasy novel. Interesting world, characters and plot. Something was missing for me though. I couldn't place my finger on what exactly, but it was not as good as Sandersons books for example. Especially the dialogues seemed a bot lacking in a way. The main character is a great and funny one anyway, so if you're on the lookout for a new series, and already read through most of the genre, this might still be a nice change while waiting for the next favorites."
4235,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"Stating this upfront. It's not genius writing. The characters are two dimensional and perfect. They look perfect (except for when they have a feature that turns them from perfect to unique), they act perfect, their motives are noble and honorable, except for the villains who twirl their mustaches and laugh at their maniacalness. Okay, maybe not quite that bad but it's close. Every cliche that could be hit seemed like it was. No it didn't wrap up the main conflict. There don't seem to be any subp"
4236,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"I remember this series very fondly, but I think I enjoyed it more as a teenager. It's still a good read, but the plot is a bit too ""go here; chase clue; repeat"". Subtlety is not Eddings' strong point. Like On Basilisk Station , the humor is a bit too on-the-nose, the protagonists are a bit too capable, and the author relishes showing antagonists getting their comeuppance. The story very much doesn't stand on its own (which has become a pet peeve of mine). And the prologue is a fictitious legend t"
4237,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,"This is either my 3rd or 4th reading. Admittedly, it has some of the flaws of most of Eddings' work: the characters are chuckleheads and the plot usually revolves around...well, I won't spoil it but you can probably figure it out. However, there are some marked improvements (and in the realm of general fantasy it is better than most). 1. Sparhawk is infinitely superior to Garion. 2. The bad guys are far more interesting than in the Belgariad. Azash is truly something to be feared. Kal Torak, by con"

The sound quality kind of sucked, but I've read the book in paper several times, so it wasn't a huge deal. This is a simple story, a fun romp, that doesn't take itself too seriously. It's an interesting world with a neat system of magic & a definite goal. The characters are pretty standard, but their dialog makes them more interesting. I love that Faran, Sparhawk's horse, plays such a great role. It definitely ends on a"
4239,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"I suspect that the high regard in which I held Edding's writing had more to do with the context of my life at the time that I initially discovered his work (starved for distraction) because... this, at least, really wasn't very good. And filled with disparaging and unnecessary references toward women. It is possible that this is just the very worst of his efforts, but... I think I'll have to stand by the past tense ""held,"" in my opening sentence, as far as that high regard is concerned."
4240,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"The dialog in this book is probably the best thing about it. Eddings has a WONDERFUL talent with snappy remarks and clever comebacks. I remember when I first read it, reading bits aloud to my sister. ""But ThPARhawk"" he lisped. ""You know how thatin thpoths when it geths wet!!"" Yeah, probably doesn't mean much to you, but trust me, it was hilarious. It's a true fantasy novel, with knights and magic and battles and the works. Definitely my favorite Eddings novel.

4242,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,"Reread this book for what may be the sixth or seventh time. It's a day read, potato chip craving that somehow moves beyond. This book has the elements I cherish most. It has plot, pacing, action, and character development. If you are a slow reader the book may lack urgency. Sparhawk is a three-dimensional character, not the best but far from the worst. You get to know the first few characters in the starter and the plot presents equally appealing dual conflicts. If you haven't read anything by Da"
4243,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"This is the beginning of a new edding series and I am not as hooked as I was with the prior series of his. Plot line is ok so far. Characters are brilliant. I love sparhawk and Kuriks constant bickering, like an old married couple. Just not as gripped by this as I was before with eddings. Still good just not great. I will perservere!"
4244,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,"4.5 ok, so it's kinda formulaic, but the characters and their dialogues are just so utterly charming, I wasn't immune. On to The Ruby Knight!"

He sets out on a highly political and violent quest to rout out who is behind her mysterious illness and thwart those people that would want to usurp her throne. I enjoyed this book. It wasn’t earth-shattering, but it was a fun read. It was also a fast-read. I made it through it’s 435 pages in 6 hours or so. What enjoyed the most would be some of the quotes. Eddings made s"
4249,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,2,"On the one hand, I want to give credit to Eddings for trying to write this. He went from family-friendly bestselling non-Tolkien epic fantasy author of all time (at the time) to, immediately, a dark and brutal semi-noir proto-grimdark story about church politics, drenched in sex (albeit off-screen) and blood and elder gods and incest and pederasty and fountains of blood and ethnic cleansing and blood. And when I was eight, I loved it, although given his massive decline in sales apparently a lot"
4250,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"The most I can say about this right now is: First, the story is not tied up at the end of this book. Not in any way. (I've read this before but forgot that fact.) I got to the end and actually went, ""Wait a minute. What???"" Second, do yourself a favor and don't listen to the audiobook. If you must listen you can speed the narrator up to a more human sound, but still I'd recommend avoiding it all together. It gets 3 stars because I remember liking it fairly well when I read it years ago. Listening t"
4251,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"4.5 stars . That ending is great! Eddings writes spectacular characters as always and finally the plot is thickening. Sparhawk is a really likeable character. Although there are still shades of Belgariad/Malloreon characters in all of the other characters, it might just be because I've missed them all."
4252,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,1,"Read this many years ago, and ended up skimming the second half. I could see why Eddings has such a poor reputation: the writing was boring and the characters were caricatures, with flat dialog and a generic Epic Fantasy Quest plot. I've never been tempted to read anything by Eddings since."
4253,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"Not a ground-breaking fantasy, and definitely reminiscent of the Belgariad. But it's good, nostolgic, David Eddings fun, so it gets a 4 in my book."
4254,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"I asked someone to buy me this book in grade seven, if memory serves. I had read and loved Eddings' other series The Belgariad by that point- Pawn of Prophecy was the first novel I ever read by myself, giving it a special, permanent place in my heart - and I was eager to read something else from the guy who, at the time, was my favorite fantasy writer (and the only one I knew, which would be why). I read maybe a third of The Diamond Throne before realizing I didn't care; and I stuffed it, disapp"
4255,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,2,"It's my own fault. I picked up The Diamond Throne because of my fond memories of reading The Belgariad as a teenager. In my own defense, I can only hope that Eddings' earlier work was better than his latter. Despite getting through four hundred pages of The Diamond Throne , I couldn't muster enough patience to get through the last few chapters. The characters are shallow, the plot circular, and the only notable themes are racism, religious tripe, and the type of avarice which you expect to find i"
4257,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"If nothing else, I can credit this book and the subsequent series with being the books that got me to really fall in love with reading. I always liked reading, but this was the book that opened the flood gates. It was given to me by a friend when I was in seventh grade and it's safe to say it changed my life. So whatever I may think of it now, it will always have a special place in my heart. That said, as an adult, it was pretty mediocre. Eddings has fun characters, but they're pretty one-note. T"

So, needless to say, this second round was a bit disapointing. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed it, just not like I thought I would. First of all, I think I remember the whole series, and I thought that a lot more happend in the first book. But that is okay, because at least I have something to look forward to. The story still has plenty of good plot, and is a gr"

This is a great sword-and-sorcery adventure tale, complete with the heroic knight, his handsome best-friend comrade-in-arms, an ethereal sorceress, and the lovely spellbound princess they're all trying to save. Plus, it's got a whole cast of interesting characters and a lot of snappy, entertaining dialog. The real shame about Eddings' books is that the great stuff from THIS book is th"
4263,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"c1990. Nice comfortable old fashioned/main stream swords and sorcery fantasy novel. The protagonist has the most memorable name of Sparrowhawk and the copy that I read had been well loved and frequently. Its the type of book that I can read in between heavier books and read with a smile. Good start to a great series. Publishers Weekly's review contained the words ""graceful, fluid style of storytelling"" which I feel is a 100% correct. FWFTB: sleeping, jewel, entombed, doomed, exile. FCN: Queen Eh"
4264,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,"I have read this book several times before, but not for about 25 years and I wondered if it had ‘stood the test of time’. The start of the book is a bit like Clint Eastwood riding into town at the start of a Spaghetti Western , in fact Sparhawk has a little of the ’Man with no name’ about him. The rest of the book is a fairly typical David Eddings fantasy, it is easy to read with an interesting group of main characters. There is always something happening, although at times it feels like it is tak"
4265,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"If you never read The Belgariad, this could be a great series. However, if you started following Eddings when he surged onto the scene with The Pawn of Prophecy, as I did, you will see that The Elenium is just more of what Eddings already did in The Belgariad and The Mallorean. It's as if he took all the character archetypes from those books and scrambled them up and re-presented them with new bodies and throws them back into the same old plot. Isolated, it's a good read; however, if you've read"
4266,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,1,"This book was one of those ones that reinforced in me the lesson to ""never judge a book by its cover"". It lured me in with its pretty purple cover and mention of Knights and Queens and crystal thrones and magic spells and ethereal fantasy names. Unfortunately, it turned out to be one of the worst fantasy books I've ever read. The one positive thing I can say about it is that it didn't cost me anything and I was quite happy to return it to the library."
4267,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"Easy, escapist fun. I first read Eddings in middle school and I still re-read his books when I want fantasy with a sense of humor, friendly banter amongst protagonists, heroes doing the Right Thing, and bad guys who do the Wrong Thing even though they often feel badly about it. Eddings' best series is The Belgariad, but I enjoy this one too--Sparhawk (and his horse) are grouchy and funny, and the female characters are strong and feisty."
4268,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"All possible cliches, tropes and archetypes of high fantasy are present in it and its practically a guide for the same. However the book lays a solid foundation to the trilogy with its engaging characters, amusing dialogues and provides a good pace. Its super fun read with characters that seem awfully similar yet offer a sliver of their own personality every now and then. Eddings narration rarely takes rest as the plot moves in a steady pace. All in all its a great start to the series!"
4269,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"Has similarities to Eddings' other stuff but this is definitely an adult series whereas the Belgariad and Mallorean were slightly more kiddie. Interesting world and I'm loving the organization and personalities of the knights but I can see that this may get a touch long, I was hoping the main task of this book would be completed and lead in to the larger overarching quest, but it seems it's going to be dragged out."
4270,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,First book of The Elenium. Just the sort of epic fantasy I have come to expect from Eddings. The focus of the characters in this book are religious knights similar to Paladins. Some good action in here along with some dry humor.
4271,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"As the first book of a series its great! Good characters, a noble hero and a truly despicable villain. Yes, its a ying-yang kinda thing. Looking forward to the next one in the series and that is the most important thing. It leaves you in suspense. No other word for it."
4272,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"I really enjoyed this. The style is very frank, a little archaic, and some of the words are fun. The storytelling is easygoing with humor interspersed, and it was an easy read for me. I'm gonna go hunt down the sequel now, because the story isn't complete without it. =P"

4274,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"A decent fantasy series by David Eddings that pales in comparison to his masterpiece, The Belgariad."
4275,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"A good, smooth, quiet fantasy. After the ""turbulent"" Butcher's Codex Alera and Clemens's The Banned and the Banished, Eddings is exactly what I needed."
4276,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,I felt like this book was an enjoyable introduction to the series. There were quite a few funny moments which I enjoyed and there were some pretty great characters.

In this story, the Pandion knight, Sir Sparhawk, returns to Elenia after a long exile, only to discover not only that his queen and ward, Ehlana, is gravely ill, being kept alive by a very costly spell, but also that the ambitions Primate Annias and the bastard son of Princess Arissa, Lycheas, are ruling Elenia in her stea"
4280,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"""Nature gives neither rewards nor punishment - only consequences."" Eddings excels at light-hearted, tongue-in-cheek, back and forth dialogue. An example of this repartee comes when Kalten offers an opinion to Sparhawk: ""I still think Vanion's trying to be too clever about this."" To which his friend replies: ""Maybe that's why he's the preceptor and we're only knights."" The Elenium is packed full of such exchanges. Another, for taste: ""I like talking with whores,"" Kalten said. ""They've got a nice, u"
4281,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"The Diamond Throne by David Eddings is the first of three in his Elenium series. Published in the 90s, I've read that this series has been heralded as a classic by many and was the author's claim to fame. I was looking for my next political fantasy book/series when I stumbled upon this series in a couple of recommended lists online. After reading a couple of forum posts, I've decided to give it a try. In many ways, The Diamond Throne seemed like a good ol' throwback classic in the fantasy genre"
4282,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,2,"An uninspired plot, page after page of irrelevant exposition, uninteresting characters - maybe this book isn't bad, but it isn't any good either. The author spends far too much time world-building, giving you so many names of races and countries that you won't remember more than a couple, then abruptly rushes into the main story - so quickly that there is no time to sympathize with the protagonist (or anyone else), or even get a vague idea of what he's like. The queen he's supposed to save is sim"
4283,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,3.5 This was a solid first book in this fantasy trilogy. It's definitely quite traditional in terms of the fantasy genre (specifically high fantasy) but it's still a very enjoyable and fun read. I enjoyed getting to know all of the characters and the writing is easy to get into. For me personally there was something missing but I can't really say what. I think the dialogue could have used some work at certain points and the writing was a little clunky at times. Overall this was a fun read and I
4284,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,1,"Looks like somebody wanted to write his own The Black Company (there is even a weird-and-powerful-little-girl-companion), but, well, failed. Good characters are all nice and sweet, like each other and always see eye to eye, and their conversations are quite saccharine, while bad guys look pathetic, pimply, and idiots, main character has finger in every pie, and most of the times somebody asks who did this (good thing) or who will do this, well, you know who."
4285,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,"Yes, many have said their are parallels between this series and the Belgariad, but to be honest, this is pure fantasy delight with some very funny dialogue between the main characters of the book. I got sucked in after just one chapter and ended up reading this in just over a fortnight, something I hadn't done in a while. I think if you enjoy fantasy, have a love for knights and castles, are enthralled by magic and wonder, then you will be transported by this story. I approach the second book wi"
4286,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,"For a long time I have wanted to try a story by David Eddings. After reading this one I wish I had not taken so long and cannot wait to read another. The story was fast paced and well written. While there were no real surprises, I still had a great time reading it. I kept finding myself laughing. The sarcastic wit instilled in the characters was perfect for my taste. I would highly recommend this story to all fans of fantasy, especially Terry Brooks and Piers Anthony. I think they will enjoy the"
4287,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"let me begin by saying that I really did like this book. The only issue that I really had with it was I felt there was a lot of conversation, and not a whole lot of action. That aside though, I eally did like the characters. Once I started reading, I was so invested that I just wanted to know what was going to happen next. :-)"
4288,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"This one was a good surprise, it started off boring and then the creativity kicked in midway; I especially loved the way Eddings described each character in detail, i almost felt like i knew them. The only downside was the way it ended and i have to go hunting for the next copy so i could get answers."
4289,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,"This books i absolutely fantastic it's a great bread for anyone who likes fantasy or action, there are 6 books in this series and if you are looking for an engaging detailed read this is the way to go, This book is also great if you like violence although it doesn't get to much of the violence until you get to book 3."
4290,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,2,"I hadn't realised that I'd started this before and given up! I didn't remember any of it, which I'm not sure is a good thing. It's ok, but no where near as good as the Belgariad. The characters are a bit flat, the world not particularly interesting, and the plot is mostly padding. I don't know, I'll probably try the rest of the series since it's easy reading but nit gripping."
4291,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,I'm unsure if this series is simply not as good as the Belgariad or the Malloreon or if I just got bored with the formula by this point. Maybe a little of both. Sparhawk is not the most likable lead...and none of the other characters are very memorable (even his squire wots-his-name). The troll gods were neat but not really anything new...quite the 'meh' series really.
4292,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,"While I have outgrown some of Edding's other series, this one (and the follow-up, the Tamuli) are ones I keep coming back to. The protagonist, Sparhawk, is perhaps the most interesting ""paladin"" I've come across and the story is fantastic enough without feeling entirely contrived. I'll keep re-reading this one every few years."
4293,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,2,Cardboard characters with dubious magic solutions. Normally I like wit and sarcasm but this came across as a pompous western wrapped in Arthurian legend. Should have put it down when I realized I hated the writing style around page 100.
4294,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,Excellent. I wished I had discovered this author before now. Storytelling that is the best I've read in a while. My regret is I wish I had bought the second book at the same time as I got the first and third. Strange how it is unavailable in the US.
4295,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,"It's been 10 + years since I have read this series by David Eddings. I only remembered a few characters and the general plot of it. Really excited to go back through this series. Book One, The Diamond Throne, was full of action, drama, comedy, and heartbreak."
4296,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"Good book, but frankly I didn't like Sparhawk. He struck me as arrogant, petty, and frankly not an inspiring hero. I finished this trilogy, but opted not to go through the follow up trilogy, the Tamuli."
4298,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"This series is a fun, light, occasionally laugh out loud funny fantasy series. Basically, if you've read David Eddings, you've pretty much read this. But it's an entertaining, light read."
4299,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,As Always I find David Eddings produces a book with depth.
4300,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,Sparhawk was such a fun character. He is what made this book so enjoyable!
4301,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,I thought is was a okay book I didn't love it but also I did not hate it. I would say to read it if you are into magic and knights and war. over all it was a pretty good book.

4305,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,Rereading for nostalgia at the end of a hectic year
4306,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,It's not literature. But it's fun. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and can't wait to get my hands on more.
4307,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,I felt the need to re-read this book series and I wasn't disappointed.
4308,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,One of my all-time favorite authors and book series.
4309,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,"A re-read for me, and it still holds up - a classic piece of fantasy writing which delivers to die hard sword and sorcery fans like myself."
4310,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,Fun fantasy novel with pretty pedestrian writing and dialogue. Very well built world and society is sometimes marred by flat and uninteresting conversations.
4311,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,That was fun.

4313,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,(I'm not sure when I first read this book... just that it was before my re-read in 2011.)
4314,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,This was a reread. I remember loving this book as a teen but tbh it didn't really stack up to my adult standards. It's okay and the story rolls along quite engagingly but his depictions of women are cringe-worthy and I found some of the language made me want to get out my editing pen. Fairly average.
4315,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"I believe this is the third time I read this book, the first being when I was eleven or twelve. I was horribly worried that my fond memories of this book and the story would be tainted; that it would not be half as wonderful as I remember. I am very happy to report that I had nothing to fear. The story is just as magical as the first time I read it, though time, age and distance has helped me understand the book in a slightly different light. For starters, the world is relatively unimaginative, se"

Thankfully, that was not the case at all. I felt like the Elenium series' pace is a little faster than the Belgariad and Malloreon's, which is a plus, and this series feels a little more mature than the other two did (probably because of the main character). Sparhawk is a knight b"
4321,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"David Eddings’ The Diamond Throne is the start to an incredible series that is very similar in some ways to The Belgariad and The Mallorean, also books by Eddings. Both are set in medieval worlds, and both have magic. Eddings has kept them different enough as to be both very interesting and fun to read. As always with his books, he has made the characters almost seem real, the dialogue, narration and thoughts all describe what could be a real person, Instead of skipping over the menial things th"
4322,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"I've read this novel at least six times now. As another reviewer remarks, Eddings' novels are like comfort food. Thus I enjoy re-reading the Belgariad / Malloreon books and this trilogy. I think some of David Eddings finest writing is to be found in the first Sparhawk trilogy. It could be argued that these books were precursors of the ""grimdark"" fantasy genre. While Sparhawk is not an anti-hero per se, he and his companions blur the lines between good and evil to some extent. The material in the"
4323,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"Fantastic book! Lots of fun and a great cure for a reading slump. Also, a fantastic intro into fantasy for anyone not that well acquainted with the genre. - Plot & Story: Very interesting story, but always very straight forward in terms of plot. Though it has some mysteries and twists those are largely predictable, but that does not take away from the enjoyment of the story! The end-goal is also very identifiable early on and it makes the entire story more engaging, since I am (at least) vag"
4324,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"Lovely lore+magic system, but the characters all feel rather flat and one-dimensional. The good guys are good, the bad guys are bad, and even the grey ones follow pretty stereotypical tropes. Goodness prevails throughout the entirety of the book — the villains are always somehow thwarted by our merry band of knights and their suspiciously deus-ex-machina-flavored good fortune (eg, ""Oh no we're in a foreign city and we need a means of escape without being seen by our enemies... wait! I have a cou"
4325,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"Don't get me wrong, this book was a good book, a solid book, a cornerstone of modern fantasy, however I can't class it among the best fantasy out there, the dialogue is often overly archaic and formal, and then suddenly switches to being the opposite. There are also more than a few names in there that challenge the tongue, and the eye, and unfortunately they do detract from the story at times, but that's just Edding's way, as you'll know if you read his earlier series. Despite these few niggling"
4326,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"I am re-reading this series for the third or fourth time. When one rereads Edding's books a lot, one notices that the female characters all sort of blend together and the male characters all sort of blend together. The stories are still entertaining but the characters are a bit to alike. Despite attempts to make the characters more individualized, he then keeps giving them dialogue that could have come from any of the characters, not just the one actually speaking. I still recommend this series"

I was definitely younger than nine years old... My brother liked it, so I had to read it. I remember loving it, though.

4328,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,"From the author of the Garion books comes a series that by my count is a tossup between which of the two series is the best. One of the refreshing things about this book and the two series it introduces is that the main character is not the fantasy norm of a young man out to discover the meaning of life during his trial to become a man. Instead the main protagonist in this work begins the book as a grizzled, middleaged knight returning from exile after having a disagreement with the king of his"
4330,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"Originally published on my blog here in January 2002. The Elenium, Eddings' third series, is his best fantasy writing to date. Its hero, the grim Sir Sparhawk, helps keep him from the sentimentality and archness which mars much of his later writing, and it contains some powerful ideas and a well-realised background. The story of this first part is concerned with church politics (medieval European style) in the kingdom of Elenia. Ambitious and corrupt Primate Annias has persuaded the weak king Aldr"
4331,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"In my opinion, a great book, but not quite phenomenal. The style of humor in this start to The Elenium is on one hand enjoyable and what one should expect from David Eddings but on the other hand seemed to lack variation in a way, too much of the same manner of humorous dialogue, kind of how I think Brian Jacques' Redwall books are fun to read but as some others see it, the writing and course of events became formulaic and such. I did find some of David Eddings' ideas very cool and interesting,"
4332,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"The Diamond Throne is the first book in the Elenium trilogy and the first book in a series of six featuring the same characters and world. I read this book a number of years ago and I really enjoyed it then. Being able to read it again was like meeting up with some dear old friends. At the same time… it’s been such a long time since I read the series that there were parts I’d entirely forgotten. It was great to be reading a book and saying, “I didn’t remember this happening…”.

He and his brotherhood, with the aid of a legendary sorceress, must find a cure for the queen while keeping her throne secure. As the plot unfolds, however, they discover a larger evil is threatening their world. Starts off slow, but improves once the action gets underfoot. Sections of back story drags at the momentum,"
4335,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"This is my first book by David Eddings, one of those authors I always considered but never tried as a kid. This is straight-up Middle Fantasy. It's not Sword and Sorcery, but it also lacks some of the sophistication and elegance of High Fantasy, in my opinion. This is something of a breath of fresh air after the modern trend of dark, foreboding and depressing fantasy. Still, the novel isn't without its share of faults. The author's hand is far too heavy, causing things to happen purely for the s"
4336,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,"David Eddings just can't fail, can he? To be honest, I hesitated to read this because I loved The Belgariad/Malloreon and that whole world there and the characters (especially Silk) and I just couldn't imagine anything but disappointment out of the Elenium because it seemed so different and.. grown up and serious of sorts. But MAN was I wrong! The style, the humour, the awesomeness... it's all there! I loved Kalten and Kurik, and Aslade reminded me so much of Molly Weasley ^^ And Sparhawk is jus"
4337,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"Book one of the Elenium and David Eddings attempt to escape the world of the Belgariad and the Mallorean. I remember back when this book was originally published being excited to see another David Eddings book as well as disappointed it was not another series about the world which made him famous. Today though, with a new perspective towards novels, I applaud him attempting and somewhat succeeding escaping the trap that many other authors such as Raymond E.

4339,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"It's been a while since I've read a good fantasy-adventure story. I came into this novel knowing very little about it, and ended up really enjoying myself. Not only did it establish the world very well, but it gave some very memorable characters and amusing moments to interrupt the serious tone. First I want to talk about the world-building, which is always an important part of any fantasy novel. I like that the reader is immersed into the world without too much heavy explanation. I gained unders"
4340,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,"This was a really good read. I've been wanting to get into Eddings' stuff for quite some time now and finally decided to begin with The Elenium. I think this first book was masterfully set up as a basis for the books that will follow. The premise is, of course, quite awesome, and I enjoyed the magic that Eddings created for his characters. I'll be looking forward to reading more of the series so that I may find out about more about the characters. I feel as though I only got a glimpse of many of"
4342,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"There's always a strange sense of anti-climax for me, whenever I read the Diamond Throne. Maybe it's because the first time I read the Elenium, I read the second book first and ruined a lot of the plot twists for myself. Maybe it's because, given the pains the prologue goes to in describing the Bhellion, it's a dead giveaway that this will be the one magical object than can cure Queen Ehlana. Or maybe it's because so much of the book is given over to world building. But it's really, really good"

4344,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,"Okay, so I loved this book, I am totally into the story, and glad that I bought the entire trilogy at once. I hate finishing a book and not having the next ready and waiting. There was not a whole lot of resolution at the end, in fact, it seems to me that this probably should have just been one really long book. I am pretty far into the second, and again I doubt there will be any resolution to most of what is going on. But, unlike the Song of Ice and Fire series (George R.R. Martin), I was not so"
4345,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,"It's so hard for me to rate this book! I've loved David Eddings' books since I was a kid who found them stashed away in a friends basement. I've read this series a few times, especially as a teen, so it's full of nostalgia for me. However, if I was reading it now, it would rate much lower. I love the characters and the story so much, and they just get better as the series goes on! Sephrenia and Aphreal are wonderful characters - the whole group is really. But the writing........ is not great. Ed"
4346,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"Although I loved the Belgariad trilogy as a kid and was really excited to read something by Eddings again, and although characters in The Diamond Throne are lovable and it will be rather unpleasant to leave them to their own devices, I decided not to continue reading the Elenium trilogy. The structure of the story is too frustrating for me; there's a problem and the protagonists must take a step to solve it. They take it and discover ""a follow-up problem"" and they must take a step to solve that."

4351,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"The Eddings's trademark wit and humor is easy to find in this series. It's a little darker than one might remember from series like the Belgariad or the Mallorean; The Elenium gets far deeper into really Byzantine politics and cloak-and-dagger plots. I started out on the Belgariad as a teenager and I think I was a little reluctant to try out any of David and Leigh's other works (outside of the Belgariad mythos). When I stumbled onto the Elenium in a used bookstore, though, I was far from disappoi"
4352,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,if you get beyond the familiarity of the writing or the strange sense you have met the characters before. This book can be indeed like a comforting blanket for those reasons. You know what you are going to get a band of heroes a quest in 3 books and finality and conclusion. Where Gods and mortals work together. I suspect that having a god that actually answers you in the here and now is something everyone would like. A physicality to faith that and being able to do magic. This first book sets up
4353,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"I have a soft spot for the series with using the trilogy omnibus on coach trips. This is a more adult rather than youth based series when compared to the Belgariad/mallorean quintologies. Resultantly it is a better book and series for it. While predictable, it is an ideal fantasy comfort read with better rounded characters, flushed out better compared to earlier books. The story and editing are good and it travels at a good pace, with just the occasional moment of excessive tweeness. If you enjoy"

4355,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,2,"I love the Pawn of Prophecy and the Belgariad series so much I had to give Mr. Eddings another chance with a different series. So sad, that it was a little too similar to the Belgariad, with the same characters and personalities, but with different names and roles. The new mythology of this world is interesting and different so I got through the story, but I couldn't stop my brain from constantly comparing to Rand, Belgarath and the rest of the crew. This is still well written and edited so I'll"
4356,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"An fun and entertaining novel, although not very remarkable. It's kind of your run-of-the-mill fantasy-adventure fare with knights, kingdoms, magic, sorceresses, and age-old relics of untold power (the book even starts out with a prologue that is scarily reminiscent of the forging of the One Ring from LOTR). While The Diamond Throne is fairly mainstream, there is a light-heartedness about it that is hard to dislike. The characterisation is probably the book's strongest aspect; the novel's hero,"
4357,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"While the Elenium series has all the faults of Eddings previous series, the one dimensional female characters who always fall in love with much older men, the travelogue style of storytelling, etc.; it also had two very interesting features for me. Fist, the protagonist was not a youth who has no idea of how important he is and through whose eyes we learn the world. Our hero is a grizzled veteran (although, of course he ends up with a teenage bride), which gives a fresh look at world building. Se"
4358,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,Remember the old adage - never judge a book by it's cover? Well I did and am glad for it. This was my first foray into fantasy fiction soon after I began my 5 year tenure at WeeBee (Waldenbooks). The cover art caught my eye and I ended up reading the entire story arch. I ready a lot of fantasy fiction since but this was the one that opened that door. Still have the hardcover in my archives. I still do a lot of my book shopping by this method (judging by the cover art to make first a first impres

The book introduces many characters and lands, and works to develop both, with varying degrees of success. By the end of this book, the evil plot is revealed and a plan to restore order and save the queen is determined, though no real headway is made yet. This is a quick read and a book that can easily be put down and picked back up again. However, that does mean that some may choose to leave it rather than finish"
4360,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"Classic fantasy at a fantastic pace. I read this originally as a pre-teen and it was one of my first introductions to the genre. I was hooked. I eagerly awaited the day when the next one would hit the shelves at my library and requested the next through the inter library loan system. Devoured each in the series and hungered for more. The book and the series are trope ridden and formulaic but the characters are engaging, dialogue is witty and the characters endearing. I've gone back and reexamine"

(The first one was passed around to so many friends it just fell apart.) It may not be the best written fantasy, and many people here on Goodreads have many comments that are not in favour with this book, but I love it.

4362,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"I have not read any of novels by David Eddings, so I looked forward to this. However, I was frankly somewhat disappointed: it was just okay, never reaching any higher level. The plot was rather basic adventure story with random stuff happening, the characters seemed a bit too cardboardy (there's the hero, the sidekick, the mysterious kid, and so on) and I never got the urge to keep on reading after finishing one or two chapters. Also, the mission the main characters undertake seems to be very ur"

After recently rereading all three, and The Tamuli as well , however, I've come to decide that this is the best of them all. Sparkawk makes for a much more enjoyable protagonist than Garion. The setting is much more interesting, and feels more fleshed-out. I also preferred that for most of the series the power level of the magic involved was somewhat less ridiculous. The series still has its faul"
4365,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"I have liked David Eddings for a long time. His stories will probably not change your life, however as sword and sorcery goes The Diamond Throne is a solid first part to the Elenium trilogy. The Hero Sir Sparhawk returns from an enforced exile to discover the new Queen has been poisoned, and the kingdom is rife with political intrigue. And so begins his quest to save the Queen and restore balance to the continent. An easy read with humour and sword fights a plenty. well worth a read. :) Now the on"

I had read several other books by the author when I was younger and was looking for a fun quick read so I opened up this book and was not disappointed. I enjoy Eddings' style. The the characters are complex enough to be interesting, and the story lines offer enough twists to keep the books engaging without being too con"

It's fun, the main characters are wonderful, the plot is intriguing. Lots of witty exchanges, close calls, and swordplay - of course. My only scruple, coming back to the series now that I'm weighed down by a bit of literature education, is the unnecessary use of adverbs. """"Annias, I hate you!"" Sparhawk shouted angrily."" would be a good example. If"
4368,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,"I read this trilogy in high school and all I remembered was loving it. Since I was somehow convinced that it was related to the Belgariad and the Mallorean I decided to read it again. It is in NO way connected, which was slightly disappointing, but it was every bit as good as I remembered. While the plot is less intricate in this series than in the Belgariad, I think that Eddings does an even better job with the characters (something I hadn't thought possible). I laughed my way through this stor"
4370,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"Well, this book is pretty bad. The story is simplistic, there isn't any sensible driving logic behind the individual steps, elaborate plans never fail etc. The characters don't have any sort of character, they just say or do stuff that needs to be said or done at a given point. I don't think the author did any background research on things like swordsmanship or medieval warfare. Regarding the descriptions and playing-out of individual scenes, on a scale from Teletubbies (1) to Song of Ice and Fi"
4371,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"I haven’t read this book in years, so I thought I’d give it a try to see how well it’s held up. The answer is, not entirely well. The plot moves fast, the dialogue is witty, and the characters likeable. Sparhawk's a great example of a paladin in literature. But the characters personalities all fade in service to the quipping dialogue. Even the taciturn knight cracks jokes. Perhaps the characters are too likeable. And perhaps most telling of all, everything just seems to come too easily. The chara"

4373,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"Bit disappointed. I came to love Eddings through the Belgariad. Unfortunately this serious, which I've recently reread, reads like a search-and-replace of the Belgariad. The same jokes and the same characteristics are trotted out. Sometimes a single individual in the Elenium series has traits of two or three characters from the Belgariad, but othertimes one name has just been substituted for another. Is it laziness on the part of the author, or merely lack of creativity? (I'm ignoring the option"
4374,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"Darker and grittier than the Belgariad and the Malloreon, the first installment of the Elenium is fast-paced and filled with action and tough but lovable characters that you'll find yourself attached to within pages. Sparhawk is probably one of the most well-loved heroes in fantasy fiction. His no-nonsense attitude and dry humour works extremely well with his easy-going friend, Kalten, and the other additions to their party. Their bond is probably one of the biggest highlights of the Elenium, as"
4375,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"David (& Leigh) Eddings is equal parts gateway drug and macaroni and cheese: it's basic fantasy, but so enjoyable, interesting if not astoundingly innovative, just fun, and it's just comfort food. I've re-read the Belgariad/Mallorean and the Elenium/Tamuli so many times since I originally devoured them in middle school. While I prefer the Belgariad, both series can just hit the spot. The Elenium/Tamuli involves more political and religious intrigue while also being more 'knightly' than the Be"
4376,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"This was a pretty easy read. The prologue at the start had me rolling my eyes with the typical long-winded retelling of an ancient legend like so many fantasy books seem to. It did start to get better with the introduction of the main characters, but I honestly never clicked with them. None of them had much going for them - all the goody goody type that seemed to get out of any problem without a scratch, and none of them developed one bit. I'll forgive the book this since it is the first in a se"
4377,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"Beware this review is influenced by sentimentality. David Eddings is comfort food. It's funny, interesting, and reasonably paced. I grew up on these books. They were read to me as a child and they were friends during those awkward teen years. Not to say these are bad books just that they're not so terrific you won't be able to live without reading them. WARNING: If you read too many Eddings books you will begin to see patterns in his archetypes and quests. I suggest if you do intend to read them"
4378,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"A great beginning to a fantasy trilogy.

4379,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"David Eddings is an absolute master of dialogue. Most authors have a hard time making their characters talk to one another without all the awkwardness and stilted conversation. He is hilarious, he does not take himself or his characters' predicaments seriously, and I have had a wonderful time reading this. The only reason this is not marked with all five stars, is because the conflict is not resolved in any way even all the way to the last page. I am lucky to have the whole Elenium series in one"
4380,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,2,"Long since donated, I read this more than 15 years ago. Both the Belgariad and the Malloreon series became absolutely a part of me. I read them, in order, straight through over the course of two weeks and when I came to the end I was devastated that it meant I had to bid the characters farewell. When I started the Elenium series I just wasn't grabbed by it in the same way. I think I enjoyed the others so much that nothing else would do, so I wasn't able to enjoy this and barely got a chapter int"
4381,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"Good, not as good as the Belgariad but it seems whichever series you read first you inevitably prefere. I feel that these characters just are quite as developed as Eddings characters in the Belgariad and the Mallorian. For starters when you first meet his group of knights they classify one as a talker and the other as the strong silent type. Ironically, the 'silent' one out talks the 'talker' four to one in all the following chapters. That and other things make me feel like Eddings just didn't '"

It's been a few years since I've read the series, but after catching a reference to it in one of the Kate Daniel's books I decided it was time for a re-read. Of course having my computer break while on fieldwork in Myanmar where I have limited funds and little access t"
4383,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"Sparhawk as an older battered knight works well as the lead character but the rest of the cast seem to be a little two dimentional, especially the knights from the other orders. The story as a whole is quite entertaining and in this first part of the trilogy manages to miss Eddings' infuriating habit of slamming a bit of Deus Ex Machina in whenever he writes himself into a corner as in his Deamers series. This book also manages to lose the smugness that Althalus has though the protagonist's overw"
4384,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"Not as good this time around. My tastes are changing. It was not as clean as I thought it was in my memory of reading it over 15 years ago. Would I hand it to my teens? Well, I did before re-reading it and now I wish I hadn't. Eddings is a very good story teller, but why does he need to reference to naked women so much? No real descriptions are included, but I just wonder why some of the details even needed to be included. It had no real bearing on the story line and it just made the characters s"
4385,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,"I love Sparhawk! Every time he’d open his big mouth, I’d smile. He was a wonderfully developed character, and I loved the way how he’d interact with the other cast. Needless to say, I had a lot of laughs over him. The story itself was long though. Like, VERY long, and I skimmed... perhaps a few chapters... You know, for the highlights and random, snappy, laugh-out-loud Sparhawk dialog. 8) But I must say that the story knows how to get exciting when it needs too. The plot was intense! The whole th"

My family had moved across the country and I spent several hours in the various bookstores in their town. This series caught my eye and I purchased all three of the books. As I reread this book twenty five (geez, I got old) years later I realize how juvenile the writing is and how formulaic the plot and characters are. But...these books are like instant mashed potatoes to me. I know there's better things to devour,"
4387,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,I am a huge fan of David Eddings and the worlds that he creates. I feel that his books are very easy to read and his characters very endearing. I find myself caught up in the plight of the main character as they struggle to find a remedy to the problem that confronts them. Some criticism could be made that the main character of Sparhawk is not human enough and lacks normal character flaws. This however does not detract from the enjoyment I received from reading this book or any of Eddings works.
4388,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,2,"Moody opening. Get quest. Travel. Banter. Travel. Fight scene. Travel. Banter. Travel. Plot point/twist/revelation. Travel. Banter. Travel. Fight scene. Repeat. I loved these books when I first read them in my teens. Rereading them in my 20s, the bones of the formula that produced them became so pronounced that I couldn't help but see them jutting up through the meat of the novel. Sparhawk and Strider are cool. The mood of the opening is compelling. Some neat stuff happens here and there. It's jus"
4390,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,"I really think this is the book where the Eddings do their best work. It's similar, of course, to the other novels, but Sparhawk himself is a different sort of character, at least as the protagonist: one would more likely find him in a supporting role. That makes this, and the entire Elenium up to, perhaps the last few chapters, work very well indeed. I have a deep affection for Garion, but if you like to start with the best, read the Diamond Throne first."
4391,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,"I just re-read this book after saving it on my bookshelf for 15 years or so. It was intense when I first read it and I really got into the story and the fantasy world. Couldn't wait for the 2nd book in the series. Re-reading it was great fun, and I enjoyed it. Didn't have the same edge it had the first time, though. I did enjoy the characters, though. Sparhawk the Knight is a very tough customer. Worth a second read. And now onto the Ruby Knight."
4392,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,2,"Uh, I started this one before my seizure, and frankly, I can't remember what is going on. Plus there is a lot of crudeness in it. I will see if I feel like finishing it after Eldest. Only one painful book at a time... I remember now why I never finished this series. I just don't like the main character, and that just kills a book for me... If you want to read David Eddings, go with the Belgariad. Garion is a much better main character."
4393,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"Mmm, re-reading an old favorite. I've never been a huge fan of the first two books in the Elenium--there's not enough ensemble!--but it's a nice set-up for this world and so much gets put into motion in this book. And it kinda is a nice spin on some fantasy tropes, like that the protagonist is fairly experienced. There's a lot he doesn't know, of course, but he's not as young and naive as the traditional epic fantasy hero."
4394,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"If your looking for high brow intellectual stuff don't look here. This is a very good boys own yarn. I love Dickens, etc yet it was the likes of Mr eddings who sparked that passion for reading when I was a teenager. I lost him along the way but thought I would read what happened after I stopped reading. You can see similarities to the characters in the Belgariad but so what - it's a good story and you can lose yourself in it for a while. I'm glad I have found a bit of my boyhood again."
4395,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,1,"Neighbor...I am confused. I loved other books by Eddings (The Belgariad and The Malloreon series in particular), but this was dreadful. I don't understand all the 4 and 5 stars for this book. The book is almost entirely exposition. Characters repeat things over and over again, for no reason. One will come up with the most obvious idea and the rest will think he is a genius...it drove me up the wall. I already bought the second book, so will probably read it...but I am NOT looking forward to it."
4396,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"This was the first hardcore fantasy novel that I'd read in years and years that didn't start with ""Harry Potter and the~"". It took a while for me to get into it, but once I did, the story really flew by and I need to get my hands on the other two of the trilogy so that I can get an epic fantasy under my belt again. For a re-introduction into the fantasy world (or an introduction for a newbie), this book (series) would be a great place to begin."
4397,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,1,This is a kind of book you can pick if it is raining and you have nothing else to read and your tv is broken. There are absolutely no emotions in it. Just rather limited dialogs and one fully predictable plot. Reading his book reminded me of a cruse. You enjoy it at the very beginning but soon being contained on a ship with very limited choices gets boring if not frustrating. This was my first book of Eddings and I was hoping for more. Much more. Had to force myself to finish it.
4398,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,"David Eddings is one of my all time fav authors! His characters are so well written, the stories so entertaining, they keep you glued to the pages of his books. I can remember still be up at 3:00am reading his books and laughing myself silly at parts. If you like gripping books with humour, characters that don't always take themselves too seriously (though when the going gets tough they kick ass!) and happy endings you HAVE to read all of books in the two series David Eddings wrote!!!"
4399,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,"The content was, as ever, terrific. However, do not read this in the Kindle version: some idiot has ruined the layout by an incredibly huge amount of typos. There are several hundred full stops missing, which actually alters the meaning of some sentences. I had read the book in paperback some years ago, which is how I know (although some of the errors were so blatant, it was hard to miss them)."
4400,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,"I was glad to get all of the books in this series as a Christmas present, because I at the moment I finished one book I had to start the next one. And I recommend to all of you who still havent read these: buy them all before starting to read, or you will regret it the moment you finish one book and realize you dont have the next one yet. These books can make anyone fall in love with fantasy."
4401,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"Rereading this after college was a trip. Women are all irrational but deserve their pedestals; men are all either burly warriors or effeminate pederasts; sex workers all love their jobs. I didn't really pick up on those things when I read it at at 13. That said, Eddings' joy in his stories and characters is manifest, he was quite conscious of his own limits--""I am here to teach a generation or two how to read""--and he still made me laugh until I cried."
4402,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,"This is pure popcorn fantasy. It's plot-driven, bursting with action, lighthearted, humorous at times, filled with lots of characters that have little substance to any of them, and carries a sarcastic edge to it that almost seems to mock the fantasy genre. It requires nothing from the reader but that you sit back and enjoy the show. If you accept it for what it is at face-value, it's actually quite enjoyable."
4403,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"This is a well-written fantasy book. It is engaging and humorous. The only reason I didn't rate it higher was because there were a few annoying points where the characters were all just a bit too slow-witted. I know it was a tactic used to give information but I personally found that it made for some inconsistencies in character personalities, and it was just plain annoying. Despite this, I'm looking forward to reading the next book in the series."
4404,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"This is my first reread of this book since i originally read it some twenty odd years ago. I remember having some fond memories of the series, but i find it hard to believe that now. The so called knights of the church were very happy to wade into a battle and kill/murder. They were also not very pious. Some parts were good, but this is very much a product of its time, and making use of a fan base from the Belgariad books."
4405,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"I read The Elenium in my late teens, and in the following decade re-read it at least another eight or nine times. Even though I've never been big on fantasy, this story was just the right amount of funny, exciting and epic. It doesn't take itself too seriously, but still has a few interesting sociological and theological tidbits inserted into the plot. Add in a white-haired renegade knight with a ""deep, resonant voice"", and I was sold. The Elenium was a very amusing, light read."
4406,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,2,"Not nearly as exciting or interesting as the Belgariad (which wasn't terribly consistent in its own right), this is one of those high fantasy books burdened with the same tired cliches of evil coming from ""The East"" and only a handful of farsighted warriors bothering to take action. Add some tiresome political subplots and a romance with very disturbing implications, and you have an underwhelming first entry in David Eddings most overrated series."
4407,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"First in The Elenium series. This series is a prequel to his earlier Tamuli series and fills in a lot of information that was referred to in the later books. However, many of the plotlines have already been given away in the earlier-published but later-occurring books. It's starting off as a good series, and I'd recommend you read this series first before moving on to The Tamuli - there's more suspense that way."
4408,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,2,"After completing the Malloreon, David Eddings decided to create a new fantasy setting, with a new cast of characters, and write a new fantasy series with the exact same plot we've already seen twice before. The writing is still bland, the plot is still hackneyed, and now, the characters are no longer particularly charming, although they all neatly correspond to characters from the Belgariad and Malloreon. Avoid."
4409,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,It has been a few years since I read this book-Ive now read it three times and I still think its great. Any book that makes you believe you are there in the fantasy world in your mind is a great book. The story flows very well and the story is very good. It makes you want to buy the next of the trilogy to see what will happen next. Read it and you won't be disappointed especially if you like fantasy stories.
4410,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"Ah, my favourite Eddings series begins here. Sparhawk, you legend of stoic manhood. How you inspired me in my teen years! For that I offer you my never-ending 'spect. BTW, Edge of Sanity have two concept albums which always make me think of this series, for some reason. Crimson and Crimson 2. And, the US book art is awful! My mother got me the last book in the series while traveling and it was this garish comic book looking cover. Whereas the Aussie covers were beautiful painted things."
4411,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,"I first read this book back in the 90s sometime, and loved it. The main thing I love about David Eddings is his sense of humor. There's this wonderfully dry wit throughout all of his books. This was the first book of his that I read. I have since read just about everything he's written. His books aren't always short, but they are always very readable."
4412,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"I forgot this book doesn't really finish. Now I have to find the time to read the next one but it was refreshing to read it again after so many years. I still love Sparhawk the character, but I had forgotten all about a few of the others. If you enjoy heroic fantasy, you will enjoy this book. Read the series, they are all enjoyable."
4414,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,"Could be one of my all-time favourites! (I will only know for sure when all my time has passed, lol!) The story is really nice, I always love medieval-like worlds and stories about knights, but I really fell in love (sort of) with the words: the characters talk in a bit archaic and formal way, they're sarcastic and make silly jokes all the time. I love the sense of humor in this book!"
4415,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,"Great, Great, Great read! The use of the English language in this book and the series is very good. So well written and the story is brilliant. The Ruby Knight was my favourite out of the three but the first was just as good. With humour mixed with peril, and the struggle to overcome pure evil, this is a great tale that you won't be able to put down."
4416,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"I haven't read this series in a while and hot summer weather made it seem the perfect time. The Elenium is nowhere nearly as good as Eddings other work, but is (as someone pointed out) comfort reading. The wit and clever repartee is present as always. The first book did seem to drag more in this series than in his other. That caused me to knock off one point on the rating scale."
4417,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,"No matter where I have gone (including deploying overseas) and what I have done in my life, David Eddings' books have gone with me and have seen me through all sorts of times. The characters are alive and well in my mind and in my heart, and I revisit them regularly in the well-thumbed pages of my sets. I think I am on my 4th copies now...lol"
4418,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"There are a lot of similarities between Eddings' The Belgariad and this. This feels more ""adult"" somehow, but I didn't enjoy the characters as much as I did with The Belgariad. The familiarity of Eddings work was nice and I blitzed through this book because of his style and the story itself. Sparhawk is a good character and I look forward to his continuing adventures. Off to book two!"
4419,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,"Sparhawk is great character! I would love to see this is an movie (my opinion Vin Diesel would rock the part). The book is filled with plots, twists, friends, enemies and frenemies. The Queen has been poisoned and the hero must search out a cure. By the end of book one we have found HOPE of a cure, but still not the cure. LOVE it!"
4420,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"It makes much more sense then I remember it making when I was a girl. I understand the politics about it a lot more. I do think Eddings is more than a little heavy handed with his descriptions of the races, and if you look to closely you realize that the narrative relies far to much on some seriously unlikely chances. But I still enjoyed it and will probably finish the trilogy."
4421,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,I've lost track of how many times I've reread this book. I love Sparhawk with a passion that is disturbing and find the older protagonist so much more fun to read than Edding's earlier series. As much as I like the characters in the Elenium the plotting never stop making me laugh (maybe it was the gods! lol)
4422,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"I read this book 20+ years ago, and LOVED IT! Listening to it again was . . . uneventful. It is a good story, but I can't find what it was that made me crazy for the books so long ago. Different chapter and likes in my life then vs. now. That being said - I do recommend this for a good epic adventure (Lord of the Rings-esque) read. Well worth the time spent."
4423,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"I got sidetracked from my goal of catching up on all my library books by a gift from a friend--hardcover versions of the Elenium and the Tamuli series(es) by David Eddings. So I indulged myself this weekend with a reread of Diamond Throne. It's still fun, still classic Eddings (read: gender issues, oh my), and I still adore all the knightly banter."
4424,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,"A Queen in distress, a kingdom under threat, a whole load of political intrigue and then enter a knight in shining armour. In this book, Eddings has created a medieval setting in a fantasy world. It is completely gripping and I couldn't put it down even though I have read it before. Perfect holiday / honeymoon reading"
4425,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,2,"the book was okay.and i mean okay. i have few kind words for Eddings this time. given in previous success with the belgariad, he got to comfortable that he refused to take risks with another style or storyline. elenium is carbon copy of belgariad. all he did was change characters' names and bang_ the elenium. i recommend the book as a second option."
4426,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"Read this as a teenager and loved returning to David Eddings' world. Politics, gods, swords and magic oh my! I enjoyed it a lots less as an adult, the pace was a bit ambling as was their journey. However it's a great high fantasy world and I am looking forward to visiting again in the rest of the Elenium."
4427,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,2,"The beginning of a new series set in a different world, but still feeling familiar and not in a good way. The characters and plot just feels like a remix of the last series and the lame jibes continue to annoy. The good thing is that the writing is more mature and the characters are a little better developed in this series."
4428,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,"This was one of my favourite series as a teenagers. It is funny, intriguing and full of adventure. There are not one but two rogue characters who are both charming and wonderful. I am not sure how it holds up to an adult reading but I as a young adult book it works. The story held up by the cast which is delightful."
4429,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,"The Diamond Throne is well-written but is let down by a meandering, plodding plot that doesn't go anywhere. I felt like I was being taken from city to city, meeting similar people and being told the same story over and over. Pro's: Sparhawk is a great character Wonderful intricate world-building Nice fight scenes Cons: Very slow Few good female characters Not a tonne of excitement"

4432,A Game of Thrones,George R.R. Martin,1,"There are plenty of fantasy authors who claim to be doing something different with the genre. Ironically, they often write the most predictable books of all, as evidenced by Goodkind and Paolini . Though I'm not sure why they protest so much--predictability is hardly a death sentence in genre fantasy. The archetypal story of a hero, a villain, a profound love, and a world to be saved never seems to get old--it's a great story when it's told well. At the best, it's exciting, exotic, and builds to a"

The strength of Martin’s writing shines through in these pages. Each chapter is well-crafted. You know exactly how to picture the setting and you feel the desires and discontent of each chapter’s (POV) character.

It starts at five stars and can only go up from there. There is nothing negative to say about this book. Well, it is way too long I guess. But, it's beautiful. There's really nothing I can write about it that you haven't read before, right? The bigger question is why the heck am I just now reading it? Sansa kind of annoys me. Boy, the TV show is great, huh?

This is described as epic fantasy firmly grounded in historical realism, which means the reader should be able to identify an outline of the period(s), the peoples, and the sociopolitical milieu upon whose ruins the edifice of the invented world of GoT is erected. Luckily, this is not difficult to find out, even though most readers, if my impressi"
4473,A Game of Thrones,George R.R. Martin,4,"A Game of Thrones is really good. You may not think so after reading the rest of this review, but yes, I enjoyed this book. I liken it to Tolstoy's Anna Karenina in that it's a sweeping epic mostly focused on the movers and shakers while keeping the timeline linear by shifting the focus back and forth between characters and groups of characters, specifically families. Also, it's a big honkin' huge book, just like those Russian classics. Honestly, A Game of Thrones could have been made into two o"

But after watching the first episode of the TV series, I decided to give A Game of Thrones a shot--thinking maybe I'd just read the books instead of watch the shows. Unfortunately, the amount of characters was too confusing, making it hard to connect with any of them, so I gave up and watched the first season. After it blew me away, I returned to the book. With the characters and places fresh in my mind and easy to visualize, the book became eas"

I want to love this book so much because I am absolutely OBSESSED with the show and every single character. I couldn't remember why I've never been able to get through this book, so I picked it up again after season 7 (because that huge wait until season 8 is NOT cool).

4538,A Game of Thrones,George R.R. Martin,5,"WrensReads Review: My. Goodness. I, sadly, have watched the shows before reading the books…but, I am kind of happy that I went against this unwritten code of mine. There are a lot of names to remember. Like really, a lot. The show helped in a way of giving me faces with names so I can remember the relations between families and people and who did what. So, there is a benefit in watching the show before reading the books. Martin is a brilliant writer. He writes in the mind of children, boy and girl a"
4539,A Game of Thrones,George R.R. Martin,5,"I loved this book. There was action right from the beginning! I'd already watched the TV series, which was brilliant, but reading the book made me appreciate the job the directors did on the show. The casting was spot on, in my opinion. The book does have an edge over the tv show as it goes more into what the characters are thinking. Because of that, I had more sympathy for Tyrion than I did in the show. My favourite character was Arya, I just loved how tough and smart she was. I'm really lookin"
4540,A Game of Thrones,George R.R. Martin,5,"Well, that was quite the experience. I'm not entirely sure how I was ever able to put this book down before. I suppose I've adapted to reading enormous high fantasy series, so reading this was a lot more pleasant this time around. I'm not entirely sure what to say in terms of a review. It's an absolutely fantastic first novel in a series. It's wildly entertaining and everything is laid out beautifully. Everything was built up so gradually that by the time we got to a full-fledged war how and why"

Even though this book was so long and dense, the writing and intricacy of the plot is just so captivating! So many lines in here gave me chills. The characters are so complex, some so devious and goddam evil and some I just want to squeeze and protect from those evil characters! Although some chapters were slow and it took me almost a month to read, this book was an amazing read and I'm so so glad I finally read it because I comp"

It will take a while to read, but it's totally worth it, along with the rest of the series. Well written with such diverse characters that jump from the page. Constantly keeps you guessing. So compelling, so captivating, a true fantasy fiction to get completely lost in. The only thing that I did not like was : two characters that I really liked died...."

Still, with everyone goo-goo eyeing this series in TV and printed form, I just HAD to read it to catch up with the masses, didn't I? So read it I did, enjoying some things more than I figured before diving in, while a few things met expectations. First, I'm impressed by how well George R.R. Martin writes. In no way does he take the high road of difficult"

I felt some parts did drag on, but that might be because I took an entire month to read it. Overall, it went by fast and if I didn't have to read other books at the same time, I probably could have read this in a fairly short amount of time. There is so much drama and a lot of twists! There isn't a lot of action until towards the end, but I still think it keeps a nice pace to it. It's told from multiple character perspe"

When I first picked up the book, I remember the prologue being a bit disconcerting due to starting with non-major characters narrating -- but come to find out GRRM does that with each book, so okay fine. After finishing this, I have to agree with the people who call hi"

I didn’t think I’d get it, but I find it hard to remember now why I thought that way. I know that one thing holding me back was some random comment from a random, now forgotten person, that led me to believe I would hate Martin’s politics, and that they’d play themselves out in a distracting way, but that never manifested for me. Beyond that I can’t recall why I thought I would hate the book. Perhaps it was because many o"

4549,A Game of Thrones,George R.R. Martin,5,"“When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground.” An intriguing plot with grave political tension! World building doesn't overwhelm the plot! This is the best fantasy book I've ever read and probably the best fantasy series I would ever read. Not LOTR! Not even Harry Potter!"
4550,A Game of Thrones,George R.R. Martin,4,This piece of work is UNBELIEVABLE! Despite the length of it it had me captivated from beginning to end. I especially love how the point of view shifts in each chapter and also George R. R. Martin's writing style :) I will go more into depth with this in my January wrap up ;)

Okay, I've pondered and realized there is very little I can add to the fanboy/fangirl gush that doesn't exist already for this book and the series overall.

The dialogue is great, I’m falling in love with the characters, this world is really fascinating, and...OMG, what just happened!!!!!!! OMG, no way, I did NOT see that coming. Holy crap! OMG! No!

I will be going over well trodden ground. Instead, I have decided to tell you why you should pick this book up and read it now. Plot It is far too involved to provide a quick synopsis. Suffice to say there are many characters who are engaged in political intrigue, designs on the throne, ancient and preternatural rumblings and some pretty awesome dire wolves. My Thoughts This book"

I have to confess I (re)watched the show many times before reading the book. Because of that, this was very predictable, since season 1 is almost identical to this (I know this changes later on). That's probably why it took me so long to finish it. But, on the other hand, I like having seen the show first, because I already know the characters so well. I've seen some people who haven't watched the"

Either you will join the crazy hyped up fandom or you will get stabbed down by it. Luckily I was one of those who really enjoyed this book. It was an excellent book, fantastic even. Will my life continue to gyrate around this series? Probably... “... a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone, if it is to keep its edge.” Martin is a born storyteller.

They set forth at daybreak to see a man beheaded, twenty in all, and Bran rode among them, nervous with excitement."" The first sentence is flat, boring exposition.

This is without a doubt an excellent book. Given that I like good epic fantasy and good high fantasy that probably isn't a surprise to anyone who's read many of my reviews in the past.

If you've watched the tv show, the book follows the first series faithfully. Each chapter is told from a different character's perspective and I liked that very much as it didn't get boring and the chapters are short enough to read fairly quickly. This first book sets the scene for the rest of the series. I'm going straight to book 2 now, which is unusual for me as I usually like a break between books to read somethi"

From the beginning, I fell in love with the world of this series. It's so complicated, with different houses and particular weather for all parts of the country.

I watched the first season again after reading the book, it was nice seeing it being brought to life on the screen. With that said there was some differences. Differences that kept the book new and fresh, and kept me invested. Out of all the POV’s my favorite was Jon’s. Maybe because he’s my favorite from the show. I also liked seeing what was going on at King’s Landing. Certain parts that w"
4577,A Game of Thrones,George R.R. Martin,5,I really started reading the book very later after the got season 6. so i am really worried that i may be won't like the book but surprisingly game of thrones became the best and the most interesting book yet for me. Martin really captures the characters and mastered the storytelling better than the tv series. Even if i know what is going to happen (because of tv series) the story is still the gripping thrilling. This is really a great work of epic .

4580,A Game of Thrones,George R.R. Martin,2,"I've not read any high fantasy in a long, long time, but I decided to pick this up purely because so many people on my flist were raving about the series. I can definitely see why it's a best-seller. It's long, with solid prose and a plot which is complex, but not overly so; the pacing is good, and the action is mostly organic, not engineered. Martin's characterisation is probably his best point. He has a vast array of characters, and switches POV between seven or eight different characters thro"

There is no middle ground.” In the mythical lands of Westeros, seven noble houses fight for the control of the throne. A sincere friend, a deceived king, a greedy queen, a wronged bastard, an irate brother, a helpless sister and a wise dwarf. It was a vast, epic read.

The characters and their world really got me sucked into the story, but I'm glad I watched the tv series first, so I already had a bit of background on everything.

But in 1991, he was inspired by a sudden, all too vivid image which sparked his imagination, and eventually marked his triumphant return. ”I started with a vision of a scene where some wolf pups are discovered being born with a dead mother in the snow.

Lately, I appear to have been bitten by the epic fantasy bug, because I can’t seem to get enough of it.

Like condom-less sex. ________________ I'll hand this to George R.R. Martin: he writes a story that's as compulsively readable as Twilight . Really the only differences between the two are: 1) Martin's writing is better than an eighth grader's (unlike Stephenie Meyer's) and 2) Meyer knows how to end a book (unlike George R.R. Martin).

It was a slow reread, I read one chapter a day, but it helped so much. Loved it even more than the first time! And I will reread it again at some point.

There were weeks where I didn't pick it up, read a different book or two, but then there days where I couldn't put it down and spent every free second reading about the wonderful characters in this story. Yet, no matter how long it took me to read this, ever minute I did spend reading it was worth it. It is an epicly fantastic fantasy story. There truly is a reason why A Song of Ice and Fire is so popular. Part of me wants to move on to book"
4624,A Game of Thrones,George R.R. Martin,5,"What more can I say? This is how you write a fantasy world, this is how you write diverse and complex characters, this is how you write great plots and twists. All this with a good writing, sometimes poetic, sometimes ironic. Everything has a meaning, every detail is well-placed. You just have to let yourself get carried away by the words, even with fear when you wonder if one of your favorite characters will make it alive. A truly epic read!"

Not sure when I’m going to be picking it up but it will be in the next few months."

The imagination and the creativity of the author is commendable. I loved the slight twist of common words which we use everyday which the author has used in the book (""Ser"" for sir, ""name day"" for birthday, ""Maester"" for master and such others) to give it a medieval touch. The book has a wide array of characters and each of the character stays unless he"

What I didn't expect however, was that it would only take 100 pages to prove itself more than worthy to be placed among my all time favourites.

If someone had told me to read it a while back, I probably would have passed. But I watched the first episode of the show and I was hooked. My only problem was that huge cast of characters. Those men in armor all looked alike to me. I then decided that I had to read the book. Wow! Epic! I am at a loss of words to describe this book. I will say that once I finished Game of Thrones, I ordered th"

The few consensual sex scenes that are offered are written in such disgustingly trite and sexist language that I actually said things like gross and ew out loud.

I’d heard wonderful things about the series, yet I held off on reading it. I’m not one for traditional fantasy.

I've only seen about 3 episodes of the TV show (season 1), so going in to this I had a slight idea of who the characters were but still...there are A LOT of names in this, a lot of houses, a lot of words.

4654,A Game of Thrones,George R.R. Martin,5,BOOM. It's every bit as interesting as the tv series and I hope the rest of the book series is just as thrilling as this one. This is the kind of book that blows your mind away by the writing and the characters and the flow of it all and how all of these stories join together to create this magnificent world. Mr. Martin is a genius. I now see why everyone is calling him the 'J. R. R. Tolkien of the US' and I can undoubtedly tell that he does justice to his nickname and holds true to it. It takes

I have read it a couple of times over the years and every time it grips me, so that I don't want to put it down. From the arrival of the direwolves to the shocking ending, I was hooked.

A bit like Harry Potter, but darker in tone (and of course, Will Stanton predates Harry Potter by decades). A shame that Hollywood's treatment of this classic book was so epically bad. It should be noted that while technically this is book two in the series, the saga really begins here, with Over Sea, Under Stone being a prequel of sorts. Reread: 2013 I first read this book when I"

The second book in the series of the same name, apparently the first book, Over Sea, Under Stone , was written for a younger audience and provides more of a prequel than a beginning point. This book tells the tale of Will Stanton, who on his eleventh birthday learns that he is an Old One, a member of a group with magical powers who represent the Light, opposed to the members of the Dark. Cooper uses colorfu"

I read it countless times as a wee thing, of course, but it was also my book on a horrible flight home from Oxford after Trinity Term, and what I read the week I retired my first guide dog, and what I read in tiny pieces in the month after I lost my eye. Looking at that list is one of those foreheadslap moments where you notice that narrative refrain i"
4662,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"I suspect that the books of this sequence are among the most beautiful I've read. I get that feeling especially with this book. The tone here has changed already from the Blyton-esque kids-on-a-great-adventure of the first book, and the character is different accordingly. It's almost a bildungsroman, for all that we only see less than a month of an eleven year old boy's life. One of the main things I love about this sequence, particularly from this book on, is the characterisation. Where Simon, J"

I saw the trailer for the upcoming movie—and more importantly, I saw Darcy's furious reaction to the trailer for the upcoming movie, and I realized that I didn't remember these books well enough to be properly furious myself. I read the first two in the series, in the wrong order, when I was much younger, but didn't recall being particularly engaged by them, which was why I never continued. I figured that, rereading them as an adult, I'd see the error of my ways. Sadly, I didn't. I still"

As usual, I loved The Dark is Rising; the quiet moments of enchantment, the beautiful writing, the warmth of the family relationships and the reality of the bickering, protective group of siblings. There’s more adult, complicated stuff as well as simple squabbling among siblings: the whole relationship between Merrim"

Very English; magical realm beyond the mundane; contemporary (more or less) to the time of writing; YA that should appeal to adults, but it doesn't have the--dare I use this word?--magic. William, the eleven year old protagonist, is too passive. He floats through the book's big crises more as observer than an actor. Great things happen around him, but the reader does not feel that William i"
4668,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,"2.5 stars. I really thought I was going to like this more than I did. It was well-written and the premise of a story was interesting. I just never really got into the story and found myself waiting for something exceptional to happen. Unfortunately, it didn't.

4670,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,"I loved this book very much in my early teens. Unfortunately it was a disappointing re-read. The imagery is still very beautiful, but I now find the worldbuilding unsatisfying. It suffers from the unquestioning existence of Good and Evil labels. The Good are good because they are born that way. Merriman, the protagonist's teacher, places great emphasis on the burden of being for the Light, which I now find disturbing, not noble: their burden is that they have to be misunderstood by the ordinary p"

Honestly, the book was entertaining. But I still didn't like it for multiple reasons: The beginning was really hard to follow. Susan Cooper needs to make it less work for the reader to try and figure out what's going on. The plot was good; the classic battle between the darkness and the light. But Will Stanton didn't have to make any sacrifices; seri"
4672,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"12/15/16: More of my Christmas reading. This time, I'm struck as I never was as a teen how very bleak Cooper's universe of Light and Dark is. The Old Ones, for all they come from human families (presumably, if Will Stanton is representative) are not even a little bit human, and Light and Dark clash in ways that care nothing for individual men and women. Their battle isn't for the sake of human salvation, it's for things and forces far, far beyond human concerns. This becomes most evident in Silv"

I had forgotten a great deal of it, like the fact that it takes place between the Winter Solstice and Twelfth Night. I remembered that it was Will's 11th birthday, but not the significance of the date/s. It has been really interesting to read it now, with a community, and see how many people were influenced by this book and series. I can also see how it has influenced modern middle grade fantasies."

High marks for the fabulous writing (see excerpt below) and for the vivid setting (I felt I was there, during the Christmas season, in Hunterscombe, England). The plot is fairly gripping -- especially the scene in the church on Christmas Day, after everyone left, and the scene in Will's home, when a VERY unwelcome guest was invited to come in, and the scenes of the bone-biting deep-freeze that struck.

4677,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,"I’m trying to think of how many other books’ sequels are more notable than the books themselves. The Dark is Rising is the second book in the sequence, yet it was the one that got adapted into an apparently awful film, and it was the one that gave its title to the entire series. I suppose I can see why. Of the first two books, it more stereotypically conforms to the monomyth and has that “epic” quality one desires in “epic fantasy”. Over Sea, Under Stone is firmly a juvenile adventure, whereas t"
4678,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,"This is the second book in the Dark Is Rising series. Unlike Over Sea, Under Stone, this book is much more supernatural/magical. In fact, the jump from the first book to the second almost feels like a jump to a different series, except for the continuity of themes and some characters. Like the first book, this one is very well-written and passes the audiobook test, which in my experience tends to expose sloppy writing. This book, like the first, was brilliantly read by Alex Jennings. As for the"

Each wave of men in turn grew peaceful as it grew to know and love the land, so that the Light flourished again."" It doesn't quite work, I think: there's the issue of colonialism, which was arguably wave after wave of the Dark"

The entire sequence is terrific, but this is the book I always come back to - often at Christmas, when the book is set. Will Stanton's 11-year-old jump from straightforward boyhood into a world of mysticism and magic is brilliantly described, and the story moves at a perfect pace. What can I say?"

Given its midwinter setting, it's a book I often re-read at Christmas, though I hadn't done so for a few years; the last time I tried was in 2010, when it snowed heavily the weekend before Christmas and the snow didn't melt until almost New Year, and somehow having actual snow outside and bitter cold instead of the normal damp mild greyness of December made it seem far too bleak and real , and I had"

4684,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,These things are so enjoyable I'm considering hoovering up one a day before I start back at work next week. Really loved the clarity of the images Cooper paints. The carved doors in the snow. The burning log across the old lane. The palm fronds packaging the carnival mask from Jamaica. My only complaint is the persistent Potter-bashing I see in other reviews. It's as if people are angry that this series hasn't gotten the same crazed treatment and/or think that they are somehow 'better' than Potter
4685,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,"I read this many years ago, and liked it. When the movie came out (not a very good movie), I wondered what my 43-year-old self would think of my hazy memory of what my 14-year-old self had thought. Turns out my 14-year-old self wasn't much of a critic. The Dark is Rising was quite disappointing, making it all the more surprising that it won awards and stuff. I guess I can kind of see why--the writing is at least meant to seem deep. The fact that it has a literary style of any kind is a novelty,"

In contrast to the first, we are plunged into out and out fantasy from pretty much the start of the book. The setting is a few days before Christmas, and it is nearly Will Stanton's eleventh birthday. Will would like nothing better than a white Christmas, but it is a case of 'be careful, you might get what you wish for' because a whiteout occurs which paralyses most of England, and is actually a"
4688,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,"Relatively dark, this second story is shorter than the first book in the series and a completely different story. As in the first, I loved the narrator's voices for the characters. I know that these books are aimed at middle grade readers but the children's abilities to solve problems come a little too easily. I'm still willing to see what the third story brings."

Here in the second book we have a main character that doesn't really do anything---he's around when things happen but that isn't nearly the same thing. When you start a story off by having a character learn he must find certain objects, you figure the searching will be an exciting, complicated part of the plot. In this book he is either lead to each p"

I thought the first book (Over Sea, Under Stone) was not bad at all. Interesting concept. Decent plot. But this second book had the most banal characters, an undeveloped plot, and essentially no character development for the protagonist, Will. My primary issue with this book is that Cooper took a great concept (Arthurian myth) and failed to turn it into"
4691,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,"The first 50 pages or so did a good job of sucking me in. Cooper knows her English folklore well, and there's an unsettled, dream-like quality to her writing that I find appealing. But once the plot kicks into gear, the book devolves into a Manichean ""Light vs. Dark"" fantasy with a subtle but ever-present reactionary streak. The Light is almost always associated with Englishness, whereas the Dark is coded as foreign, brought into England from the big, scary Outside. The betrayal at the center of"
4692,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,"The Dark Is Rising was entertaining, but I was a bit disappointed in it. My main issue is that everything just happens to the main character, Will Stanton. He doesn't get a chance to actively make any choices or take any actions independently. Everyone just throws all the solutions to him, including giving him a book to read that infuses his mind with all the answers to his questions. It would have been more satisfying for him to work a little bit to be the hero."
4693,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,"This is a lovely seasonal read. Don't know how I missed it growing up, I blame parents! I particularly like the fact that I finished reading on a key date."
4694,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"Ask any Minnesotan - most will whisper that first winter snowfall is magical as it veils the world in glittering white stillness. Six months later that changes, but hey, it's a dazzling start to the winter marathon. Christmas is special too, as families feast around lighted trees nestled in warm houses. Susan Cooper not only captures the childhood magic of the first snow, Christmas, caroling, and more, but the magical alternate world Will Stanton falls into as he discovers that he is the last of"
4695,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"The second is the series and one that I enjoyed as much as the first although it could be argued that the writing is so much richer that I found myself questioning whether someone totally different had written it. Will, the seventh son of a seventh son, has found that he has a role to play in the great war between the Darkness of the Light and set around a time of renewal and light Cooper is clear that she is celebrating the times before Christianity and giving a more than subtle nod, again, to"
4696,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,"Vague, wordy, and devoid of detail. A typical hero’s journey, with not much to compel the reader forward. And not many important characters actually have names. So who’s ready for a vague plot summary!? ☺ Yay! WARNING: Severe sarcasm ahead! You’re a seemingly normal boy who hits puberty, and suddenly you discover that you’ve been special all along. Yay! You never knew this, but turns out you’re the only person in the entire universe who can save us all, by going on this big quest, or else the world"
4697,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"Reread for the umpteenth time. I first read this when I was around 15 or 16, and have reread it many, many times in the 15 years since. Often as the sort of slow-paced Christmastime reread that I pursued now, starting on Midwinter Eve and ending on Twelfth Night. There's a special sort of magic to reading slowly, savouring the seasonal magic of this book on the days that things happen in it. I always love rereading The Dark Is Rising. It captures a certain sort of magic better than anything else"
4698,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"It took me a while to get round to reading this. Which I don't mind too much: reading these books is like coming home, in a way. I'll touch on that more when I review The Grey King and Silver on the Tree, I think. Anyway, again, this is a bit of an on-the-spot overview of how I felt reading this book just this time. My longer review, which really covers how I've felt about the book over the course of many rereads, is here . The second book of the series is probably the most familiar, to me. I didn"
4699,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"On the eve of Will Stanton’s eleventh birthday, his dad jokes ‘We should have some special kind of ceremony. A tribal rite.’ What follows is exactly that, as Will (seventh son of a seventh son) is initiated into the fellowship of Old Ones — magical servants of the forces of Light who are locked in an eternal battle with the Dark. The book itself feels both magical and highly ceremonial — like an extended initiation rite — as Will’s quest to bring together the six signs of power required to quell"
4700,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,"Upon rereading as an adult, I'm finding this book (and series) difficult to categorize. Although on one level I enjoy the lyrical writing, the English mythology, and the fascinating world-building--I find the incongruities distracting. No wonder I didn't care much for this series as a young teen. The book itself doesn't quite know what it has to say. The battle of Light and Dark, of good against evil, is central to good fiction, and especially to epic fantasy. The major problem I found with this"
4701,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"One of my favourite Christmas/winter/solstice books - I read it every year! Now it is a toss-up to move to Brian Doyle's superb Angel Square, Terry Pratchett's Hogfather - Dickens' Christmas books come last though I might add Derek McCormick's charming Christmas Days as well! December 14/14 There is something so wonderfully rewarding in this fantasy that links the darkness of the winter days with the Dark rising against the Light - and, of course, in good fairy tale fashion, the Light triumphs bu"
4702,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"A book which I can never be unbiased about. It's just always spoken to me, ever since I heard the radio play at the impressionable age of eight or nine or so. Funny to think I did pass it over in the library, once, aged about thirteen -- it was in an edition on its own, and I didn't want to read it like that, because I'd figured out there was an earlier book, and I hate reading things out of order. This is where the series starts to mature a little. It's still pretty much Dark vs. Light rather th"

It is his mission to search for the six magical signs that will be needed for the world-shaking battle between the evil forces of the Dark and the Light, chronicled in this and the other four books in Cooper's The Dark is Rising series.

4704,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"This one is just magical. Much of the writing comes close to poetry in this title. I will insist that the writing is of higher quality than J K Rowling, as much as I love Harry Potter. This is the best of the series. Will comes into his powers and discovers he is the last of the Old Ones. He has to find the five signs and save them from the Dark. The series is based on English folktales of Arthur and Merlin. I think the reason why this never came close to Harry Potter in popularity is that Will"
4705,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"The second book in the sequence shifts gear to epic and prose to mythic. Will Stanton discovers he's the last of the Old Ones on his 11th birthday. He must gain command of his powers and quest for the Signs of the Light before the Dark puts them beyond reach. Mentored by Merriman Lyons and supported by the Circle of Old Ones around the world, can he grow up fast enough to keep the Dark from rising?

4706,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,"There was a lot more going on in this book than in ""Over Sea, Under Stone,"" and with this book the series is beginning to feel mythical and epic. An enjoyable and quick read, but there wasn't anything here that surprised me. An eleven-year-old boy is journeying around and finding little mythic trinkets in Legend Of Zelda fashion, and it's all happening in a few days right around Christmas. I would've loved this as a kid, but now it all feels old hat. But, I enjoyed it enough that I will continue"
4707,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"One of my childhood favorites, though the plot and characters still resonate with me after all these years. It has a moral complexity that adult novels all to often lack. No matter how many times I read it, it still keeps me up past my bedtime with its mood of quiet menace."
4708,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"I've read this one a number of times over the years, but today's re-read was really inspiring. This is the true stand-out of Cooper's fiction, a work equally effective for adults and for children. I think that in the ways she weaves English folk tales, poetry, and the fantastic, THE DARK IS RISING is one of the finest works of genre fiction. Moreover, the book is filled with deeper truths about sacrifice, good, evil, and the way our deepest commitments can threaten our humanity. Eat Cooper's sho"
4709,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,"A very enjoyable fantasy novel. Although written for children, it is more than good enough to be enjoyed by adults. It's not exactly character driven, and the main protagonist never really does anything, but rather has things done to him. But the plot has plenty of interesting twists and turns and I was never bored while reading."
4710,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"This is a book I read for the first time as a child. It had a profound impression then. So much so that the first snow we have the kids and I curl up to read it aloud. The setting and characters are vibrant, the magic and intensity in the tale cause a familiar shiver as an adult. Definitely a family favorite."
4712,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"2017 Review I usually want to read this book (if not the whole series) about once a year. There are very few books that I read as a child and still continue to read today as an adult. This book is one of them. There's something very magical about the story and the locations (England and Wales). My desire to travel to England and Wales can be traced directly to this series. Will Stanton is an average 10 year old, the youngest in a family of nine. The day before his birthday, strange things seem to"
4713,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,"Published 8 years after Over Sea, Under Stone , Vol 2 shows that the writer grew enormously in her craft. I hesitate to shelve this as a ""children's"" book, even though the protagonist is just turned 11. Gone are the Drew family; the scene shifts entirely from Famous-Five-wannabe summer adventure for kiddies to a rather serious YA fantasy of good vs. evil, Light vs. Dark. Though the symbol of the Light is a circle quartered by a cross, it is explicitly stated not to be the Cross of Christ, but muc"
4714,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,"I have been informed by reliable witnesses of unimpeachable character that The Dark Is Rising is a timeless classic of young person's literature. So, of course, it was necessary for me to read it. I regret that I found it so late in life. I think, had I been 9 or 10 or 11 (like the main character), I would have loved it. Unfortunately, I now find myself reading it from an adult's eyes with an adult's expectations for narrative and story. It's a standard fantasy coming-of-age quest story. Young bo"
4715,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,Novel Review for The Dark is Rising What would you do if you were suddenly forced to face a powerful force the day before your eleventh birthday? The plot of the story contains twists and loops of adventure and bits of mystery. The characters are portrayed in third person point of view and are described throughout context. The story takes place in multiple areas of time and space. The Dark is Rising by Susan Cooper is an interesting novel that follows a boy named Will Stanton and his journey to
4716,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"There are many books I enjoy, there are few I cherish. I cherish this book -- I cherish the entire series (except for the first, Over Sea, Under Stone , which just doesn't seem to fit ), but this one has a special place in my heart. The Dark Is Rising would be classified today as ""Young Adult Fiction."" When I first read it at the tender age of eleven, it was considered ""Children's Fiction,"" and it was the first ""Children's Fiction"" book I read that treated the audience like adults. It was a book of"
4717,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"Susan Cooper's 1973 novel is pretty much the last word in the Second Golden Age of British Fantasy. It's one of those books that just can't be denied, rather like a force of nature. And it's not hard to pinpoint why: there's a legacy to Cooper's work that runs pretty deep, not just in the ancient British mythology she invokes (like so many of her peers) but in the actual structure of her story. The inexorable (one of her favorite words) approach of ""the Dark is rising"" owes a lot to ""the wolves"
4718,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,"It's Christmas time, and it's also Will Stanton's eleventh birthday. His birthday present is discovering that he is an Old One, some sort of immortal magical being embroiled in the age-old battle between the Light and the Dark. His duty now as the Sign-Seeker is to seek the Signs! Signs of POWER! Here, have a rhyming prophecy for good measure. Basically half the book is exposition, and I know that this book probably inspired a lot of later fantasy, but holy Jesus Christ, the worldbuilding seems s"
4719,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,"Why is it that some books are deemed timeless and others are not? Is it because they're simply outstanding or a little weird and 'ahead of their time'. You just know in a century there will still be new fans to Pride & Prejudice or The Lord of the Rings every day. I wish I could say The Dark is Rising falls within the same category, but I cannot. The Dark is Rising is not a bad book by any means. It's exciting at times and has most of the ingredients for a great fantasy story. The Old Ones an"
4720,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,"Gorgeous, haunting, enchanting. I don't know how to praise this book as it deserves without sliding into the realm of gushing sentimentality, but it really is a delight. The plot is not flawless, but it is intriguing, and probably was not as cliche in the 60s when it was published as it now seems, given the overwhelming quantities (not quality) of fantastical-bildungsroman-type YA fiction churned out these days. The shimmering prose, though, sets this work apart from the likes of Harry Potter an"
4721,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,Read over the period 20 December 2017 (Midwinter's Eve) to 5 January 2018 (Twelfth Night) in accordance with the time period of the story. A frequent re-read - my favourite of the five books in the Dark is Rising sequence.
4722,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"Before there was Harry Potter and J.K. Rowling, there was ""The Dark Is Rising"" sequence and Susan Cooper. Thanks to a special from Amazon, I read this book again (for at least the third time) and remembered again how wonderful this series is. This book, for which the sequence is named, is in fact the second in the series. It was a Newbery Honor book. The fourth in the series (""The Grey King"") won the Newbery Award for the year it was published. Not too shabby for a 5-book series. The first book"
4723,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,"So I am working my way through the Dark Is Rising sequence at present, and now is the turn of The Dark Is Rising itself. I am struck, struck, struck by the ferocious nature of Cooper's prose throughout these books; a prose which is both eloquent and vicious and raging against the dying of the light and the darkness of the worlds. The Dark Is Rising is Will Stanton's story, and in a way it is his story that he was destined to always have and to always be at the heart of. There are echoes in this"
4724,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,1,"Got to page 49. Couldn't go any further. Where the book isn't boring or confusing, it's maddening. Page 4, an 11 year old boy uses the word 'Hark' to his older brother and ISN'T mercilessly ridiculed for it. What 11 year old boy uses that word seriously and not in jest? Really? Page 32-33, we and our young, yet ancient vocabularied protagonist encounter two doors. They are FULLY described for almost a full page EXCEPT for the fact that they are double doors in one doorway. Kind of an important d"
4725,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,We have probably all heard that The Dark is Rising by Susan Cooper is being released as a movie in October. This prompted me to dig out this series of books from the basement and re-read the first book. I last read this book when I was somewhere around 11 years of age. After that reading I thought the world of this book. The book is well-written and very descriptive. It's every child's dream to get swept into an adventure like Will is and to find out you are part of an ancient race that lives to
4726,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,"This book became a precious favorite of mine when I first encountered it in middle school. I was about the age of the protagonist, young Will, and kept wishing some special destiny of my own would be revealed at a certain age. This is a tale of the ageless battle between Light and Dark, and Will Stanton's gradual discovery of his own role in that fight, as he wakes to his identity as the last Old One to be born and embarks on a quest to acquire six Signs that will fend off the Dark. Fantasy elem"
4727,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"There are some books that shape us, and for me this is one of them. I still have my original copy, the broken binding and stained pages a testament to how often I read it. The way Susan Cooper draws her battle lines – Dark and Light, Good and Evil – is very stark, but almost everything else about this book is subtle and real, and the writing is superb. Scenes and pictures from this book have gone so deep that it almost feels as if I lived them myself: the rooks, the Signs, the beauty and terror"

He has come in to supernatural powers that will aid him in collecting the signs of power, and fighting back the agents of The Dark; for"

This is the second book of a ""sequence"" written by Susan Cooper, though it's not necessary to have read the first to understand the second. I enjoyed the story, especially because it took place in more or less contemporary times (often this kind of fantasy fiction is set in a. the future, b. the far distant past, or c. a completely unidentifiable but definitely not contemporary time. But I found the imagery a bit confusing or unclear. I als"
4731,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,"When our librarian and I were discussing the Percy Jackson books, she recommended this one to me. I had heard of the movie (which got awful reviews), but not this book. In a polar opposite reaction to the Percy Jackson set, I found myself caught up in the WRITING more than the characters or plot. Cooper's writing style is mesmerizing, woven into a style which reminded me of Poe in points. The only reason I gave the book 3 stars is that, again unlike Riorden, the characters were more old-fashioned"
4732,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"A book about Good (not really knowing what it is doing) Vs a quintessential (and almost predictable) Evil. With British myth and folklore thrown in. Herne the Hunter, the Wild Hunt, Yule, Christmas, Twelfth Night and the Hunting of the Wren. This tale is as British as it can get, and since I refused to watch the film, then I have no adaptation to compare it to, not that I should. This is Goodreads. Not sure what else I have to say really. But since I love British myth, folklore and the ritual year"

The book has a whole white/good, dark/bad theme but I still think Susan Cooper could have come up with a different term. When LOTR is probably the most influential fantasy book of the current age, you need to not have characters that are so derivative. I kind of forgive George RR Martin for copying the name of Frodo's father for Khal Drogo. Kind"

It's well-written; Cooper's command of the language is complete. But the whole quest felt like a big macguffin chase. There's no ""why"" other than, ""so the dark doesn't win."" There's no attempt to explain where all this comes from, or why these things were hidden in the first place. Just a tre"

I don't know why I never re-read it, but it's been on my shelf forever, and I always looked at it warmly, and in fact often said aloud, ""Oh, I LOVE that book"" but passed it by. Maybe I remembered how very scary it is- and oh, it is. The writing is brilliant, absolutely top-notch. There's not an extra word, and the words that are there are wrestled into new, glittering shapes both malevolent and benignant. The characters are similarly familiar"

I didn't read the first book but I didn't have any trouble picking up from the first page. It had slight suspense, mystery, magic, adventure, and intrigue. It also captured the middle grade attitude/life style perfectly. Great job."
4743,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"This was probably my 12th time to read ""The Dark Is Rising"" during the Christmas season. A classic of children's fantasy. It incorporates themes of Arthurian legend and British mythology, but remains solidly grounded in the life of an eleven-year-old boy. I have read this book annually at Christmas-time for many years."

I very clearly remember being disappointed when I first read this book that I would never be able to read it again for the first time.

4750,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"Even though this is technically #2 in the series, I'm always going to think of it as the first book. I like the story of Simon, Jane, and Barney, but in my brain it's a companion to and expansion on the main story of Will (and later Bran). I love these books so much. This one in particular always feels quaint and out-of-time to me, because it seems vaguely modern, (not obviously history-locked like Narnia) but at the same time is old enough to lack all the technological trappings of life that I'"
4751,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"An incredibly tense, ominous and compelling read. ‘The Dark Is Rising’ follows the rebirth of an eleven year old boy called Will, who on his eleventh birthday is awoken to the fight between the light and the dark, and the responsibilities that he must fulfill. He finds himself in a liminal time that balances on the edge of being overwhelmed by evil forces- who are often closer to Will than he realizes. To me, the fact that those responsible for protecting against the dark have such normal roles"
4752,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,"Confusing. Random. Bizarre. These are some of the words that come to mind after reading this book. It's a shame because the story is beautifully written. It just doesn't make any sense. The story follows Will, and English boy from the 20th century as he comes into his magical (?) powers. There really isn't much of a plot here. Just a bunch of disjointed events that flit between Will's village and family life, and his ""out of time"" experiences, some of which are decipherable, but many of which jus"

This time around I probably read it a bit slower, too, because for the first two-thirds of the book I was pacing my reading for the Twitter readalong ( #TheDarkIsReading ), tho"

With the aid of Merriman Lyon, Will undergoes magical adventures while searching for six objects that will help him defeat the powers of the Dark.

I remember the feel of first and second and subsequent readings of this as intensely as ever, and am still as delighted by the confidence of phrase and ease with which grand and old concepts and visions are described with perfect clarity, and the way that really rather mixed-up timelines come together with absolute grace and common sense.

I thought the language used was lyrically beautiful and the descriptive passages were just a delight.

4758,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"I can't believe it took me over two months to read this book. I am a little ashamed, seeing how it is a children's book after all, and I am a full-grown adult. But I will say this in my defense and to Susan Cooper's credit. This book was very thick. Not in the same sense that one of the J.K. Rowling/George R.R.Martin/J.R.R.Tolkien (or another of the impressive busy and important middle initial parade lot) tomes is thick. Instead, Dark is Rising is just beautiful and meaty for such a short novel."
4759,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,"Like many books of the era, this is just too slow for me to read as an adult. Surprisingly, it's aged fairly well (since it mentions no technology to date it). I'm not sure how I missed this as a child but I suspect I went from Robin of Sherwood on TV to The Mists of Avalon/Belgariad without picking up any children's fantasy in between. There's very little character development and no real reason for anything to be happening beyond light = good, dark = bad. Later fantasy seems to place more emph"
4760,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"This is a long way from being the first time of reading. I have a lovely edition of all four books bought for me as a child (Thanks mum) and they have been regularly re-read with joy. This one I often read as a standalone, rather than as part of the sequence - though it works both ways. Anyway I was inspired to read it over Christmas by #thedarkisreading over on Twitter. No regrets. One friend has commented that on re-reading it didn't live up to their childhood memories but for me it still does"
4761,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"I just want to say that I really like the way the main character was treated. He was allowed to be a kid. He was allowed to make mistakes that didn't ruin everything. They had consequences but it was acknowledged that he had made them because he didn't know and not out of malice. And when he acted like a kid: when he wanted to be only with his family, when he was about to cry; it was not seen as him being weak at all."
4762,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,"A compelling, frightening and magical world, interwoven with our own and made from our folk and fairytales. It's winter, snow crisp on the ground when you wake up into a different world than when you went to sleep. I love the rhyme at the beginning of the book, which you can follow through the story and the real places that are visited in the story. I read this as a kid years ago and on rereading it just a few years ago, it had all the same magic as before."
4763,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"Susan Cooper’s second book in this series builds on the strengths she showed in Over Sea, Under Stone: crisp, literate writing and a love of Mythic Britain. But she really doubles down on the Mythic Britain angle and adds a technique that I love and have used in my own work: the sudden transformation of the mundane into the surreal. Even cozy family scenes can turn on a dime into unsettling horror, while still staying suitable for young readers. She threads a very thin needle there quite skillfu"
4764,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,"Well, that was very little like the first one in the sequence, but it was good. It's much more mystic and fantastic - with Old Ones, the The Dark, Herne, and lots of other bits of myth from British history. Will on his 11th birthday finds out he's one of the Old Ones, and has much to accomplish to protect his world from the Dark. It's spooky, a bit scary, and worth the reading. Children's lit that doesn't doesn't talk down to children."
4765,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,"Our 11-15 year old group read the classic ""The Dark Is Rising"" by Susan Cooper. Most of us were disappointed as we had really expected to love it. Some commented that there was too much description, and others that the time jumping was confusion. This may be our lowest scoring book - hoping for much better next month! We rated it: 3 / 3 / 3 / 5.5 / 6 / 7 / 2 / 3 / 6"
4766,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,"This book is a bit denser and more confusing, which perhaps was inevitable as Cooper introduces the actual meat (er, magic) of the series. It definitely took more effort to get through than Over Sea, Under Stone but it was good in its own way. I'm glad Merriman was in this one as a tie-in, or it would have felt too disconnected from the first book."
4767,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,"pulled me out of a slump. loved the writing, so atmospheric and just beautiful! highly recommend if you're looking for something easy going and a little bit dark! great characters. great plot. will hopefully continue with the rest of the series."
4768,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"The twitter group read-a-long gave me the kick in the pants to pick this up and I'm very glad I did. I started reading on Mid-Winter's Eve, which is when the book begins, but I couldn't quite keep the pace until the Twelfth Night. It's eerie and snowy and the battle of Light and Dark carries on. Will Stanton wakes up to a quest that is his as he turns eleven. I'm really enjoying the read-a-long as it is fun spending time with this book with other people too."
4769,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"This book is one of the touchstones of my year. Every Christmas, after the gifts are opened, after dinner is eaten, after my family have all gone home or to bed, I light the candles in their angel candle holders and I read this book by golden candlelight. And every year it's perfect."
4770,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,An excellent re-reading over Christmas.
4772,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,"Last book I read in 2017, I first read this in the 80’s as a kid, and loved the whole series. Re read for first time since then as part of Twitter read a long. I tried to read the book with the time line of Christmas in the book but finished it ahead of twelfth night. I think it’s much darker reading it as an adult than when I read it aged 10/11 or maybe i understand more. Considering rereading the rest of the series and then might do same for the Greenknowle books."
4773,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,Third re-reading of one of my favourites. Read as part of the Dark is Reading readalong. Lovely to read at this time of year.
4774,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,"As a youth, I really enjoyed this book and its prequel (Over Sea, Under Stone). For some reason, I didn't pick up the other books in the series though. Upon re-reading, it doesn't hold up as well for me. I had zero recollection of anything that happened in this book (aside from a faint remembrance of the Christmas party scene at the manor house). So, it felt like I was reading this book for the first time. I found Will Stanton to be a bit irritating. It was hard for me to reconcile that he could"

4776,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"I'm reviewing some of my favorite wintertide comfort books for the holidays.... The Dark is Rising by Susan Cooper was one of my childhood pleasures in reading fantasy. It was dark, horrific, enthralling and otherworldly. Also, very English, which is what Christmas time should be, in my heart of hearts. What's most interesting about the The Dark is Rising is that as I've re-read it as an adult, the glory of what Cooper accomplished here grows. It is fundamentally a fantasy novel about a boy who d"

This happened with Over Sea, Under Stone as well, but in the opposite direction. 39-year-old curmudgeony Pierce wants to give this 3.5 stars rounded up to four, but 13-year-old Pierce thought this was his favorite in the series, and would surely have given it all five stars had goodreads existed back then, but Al Gore hadn't brought the internet to the masses yet.

By the next day, when he turns eleven, it has become clear to Will that the animals know what he is only about to realize: that he is not an ordinary child, but an Old One, with the important destiny of finding and bringing together the six signs that will vanquish the Dark. As the days pass from his birthday, through Christmas, and on to Twelfth Night, Will experiences the usual Christmas festivities of hi"

4786,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,"I think I first read this series in fifth grade. Unlike most books from my early life, I've reread them several times, and own the series. It's a really great blending of some general Celtic myth with bits of Arthurian as well. It's a really amazing series. In this book, Will Stanton has a birthday and his whole life changes. The youngest of several children suddenly finds out he has a legacy to live up to. He is one of the Old Ones, guardians of mortal men from the powers of the Dark. His world"
4787,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,"Well, the book struck out boldly in attempting to do a lot of things, but I don't think it quite ever did them. Too much was amorphous and vague. Too often seemed like a poor version of other great books whose feeling she was trying to imitate. Also, too many characters introduced in one book--couldn't handle the fact that all but one character was new, and the family had like 8 kids. On a larger note, I just don't know if this book fits in with the whole christian mythology type scheme that so m"
4788,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"I first read the entire sequence of The Dark Is Rising in the hot sunny conditions of a summer holiday in southern Italy - appropriate maybe for the first in the series, Over Sea, Under Stone but not so much for the second. The Dark Is Rising takes place in Susan Cooper's native Buckinghamshire, up into the Chilterns and down along the Thames during the darkest of dark times: Midwinter's Eve through to Twelfth Night.

4789,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"I reread this on audiobook in January 2017. My initial review from 2008 was glowing; I called it one of the richest books I’ve ever read when it comes to history, mythology, and cosmological good vs. evil concepts, and I was madder than a wet hen that some of the other books in the series didn't live up to it. After nine years of reading, I would mitigate the glowing terms slightly, but I would give a lot more credit to the other books in the series. I think my enjoyment of The Dark is Rising wa"

On his eleventh birthday he is told that he isn't an ordinary human but the last of the Old Ones, born on earth to prevent the forces of evil from seizing power.

4792,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,"Here it is: a well-written children's book that incorporates Arthurian and Celtic mythology without resorting to cliches or dumbing down the ideas for children. Excellent plotting, pacing, and setup for future stories. While it was very different in tone from the first book in this series (which was more of a mystery), it dealt with the same themes of the fight between light and darkness in the world. I really liked the fantastic elements throughout this book, and since it looks like the subsequ"
4793,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"This book is everything that people say it is and lives up to its reputation beautifully. A fast, fast-paced read, it manages to never feel rushed as it takes you through the twelve days that mark young William's ascension to what amounts to minor god-hood. And because this is a British novel from the early 70's, Will is neither obnoxious nor overly precious, and so his transition feels believable, including the parts of him that wish to stay normal. The cast of characters is larger but compelli"
4794,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"As a child, I never got past the first book in this series, which I seriously regret! A wonderful and rich history is woven into this story with well-developed characters, beautiful settings and just enough adventure to keep the pages turning."
4795,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,"This book made it clear that the good/evil theme in much fantasy is just about making someone else evil, without explanation, and then spending the rest of the book to show why the writer was correct. It's pretty lame thinking and lazy writing. The good are good because they are us, and so we identify with them. The evil are them, and so we don't. It's not a real exploration of the theme and how it works. This is troubling because when people don't face some outside WWII-ish villain, or the easy"
4796,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,"I don't know what it was, but I did not like this book. At all. The writing was strange; everything happens very fast and there's very little explanation given for a lot of the things that go on. Will, the protagonist, seems to obtain knowledge from seemingly nowhere. Everything moves at a very brisk pace (almost alarmingly so) and while I wouldn't say I was lost, it was definitely difficult finding even ground. The time-travel aspect of it all felt out of place, and Will seemed to do so with ve"
4797,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,"Pretty decent boy-wizard story but i preferred the previous book Over Sea, Under Stone which had less magic but more adventure. This suffers from the usual Chosen One problem, too much predestination which undermines the tension of the story. Also its a bit video-gamey. The plot involves collecting magical items and at one point something happens which i can only describe as Leveling Up, it took all my self restraint not to shout 'Level 2' Achievement Unlocked: Uncompelling! The other problem i h"
4799,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,"I liked this book, but I had a few issues with it. Her use of adverbs after dialogue tags was driving me crazy, but eliminating those is a more recent convention, I think (this book is 45 years old). Also, I really liked having an 11-year-old protagonist, but he didn't do enough. In fact, sometimes he screwed things up and had to be rescued. And the whole light/dark imagery became trite at times. The coolest thing about it was the whole mystery of it. We didn't really know what was going on--we"
4800,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,"Although this is the second book in the series, it essentially revamps the character and story and could be considered a good starting point. My eleven year old son, who is fully versed in all of the pretenders to Harry potter's throne, found the first book, Under Sea Under Stone, completely uninteresting and didn't read more than a few pages. But I dropped 'The Dark is Rising' on his nightstand and anxiously await his verdict. Where the first book constantly hints at magic and mythology but nev"
4801,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,"Forget the movie, which was total garbage, and buy this book for any child, especially young boys, who love adventure, and magic, and mystery. This is, hands down, one of my favorite series from childhood. Cooper has the very very rare knack of writing for young people without either writing down to them or treating them like adults who have been shrunk in the wash. Based in roughly modern day England, this book is wholesome and good without being saccharine, and is a ""coming of age story"" in the"

4803,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,"This is the second book in the Dark is Rising series of books. What's a bit odd about it is that the only character in this book that was in the first book, Over Sea, Under Stone , is that of Merriman Lyon and he was secondary. I did not enjoy this book as much as I did the first one. I fell in love with Simon, Jane, and Barnabas Drew and they had nothing to do with this story.

I could pick this apart as a cynical grownup, but I'm going to remember back to my 11 or 12 year old self, reading about Will Stanton for the first time, not exactly sure what was going on, unfamiliar with some of the legends and mytholog"
4805,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,"Highly recommended children's/YAs fantasy adventure set in Buckinghamshire and steeped in the mythology of the British Isles. It is somewhat dated now but since it deals with universal themes - the importance of family, of accepting responsibility for ones actions, how ones actions can have unforeseen and tragic consequences, loyalty, love, self sacrifice - it is still a very good and relevant read. It is also nice to read aloud if you are a parent. ""The Dark is Rising"" is the second novel in a s"
4806,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,"There is just something about great juvenile fiction that strikes an emotional chord with me that adult fiction often does not. I wonder if it recaptures some of the mystery and strong emotions of childhood that we often lose or discount as adults? I’m not sure, but Susan Cooper has this magic. Throughout Over Sea, Under Stone and more so in this the second book in The Dark is Rising series, I feel eerily gripped by the powerful struggle between the Dark and the Light.

I bought her a copy of this book, and while we were staying in a small youth hostel in Cornwall, we were getting ready to sleep one evening, chatting up the other guest, a young schooteacher on holiday.

4809,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,"I read most of this series in middle school but I remember very little of it. I've been surprised by all the correlations between The Dark is Rising and other popular fantasy series I've been reading lately. Will Stanton comes into his magical abilities on his 11th birthday ( Harry Potter ) and the Stanton family of nine children with a set of twins bares a strong resemblance to the Weasley family. Also, Will is the ""sign seeker"" and Harry plays seeker on the house quidditch team. There is even a"

Lewis, and others of this particular genre that when I came across this series, I was excited and interested. I love Celtic themes and stories and looked forward to reading the Dark is Rising Sequence. My problem with this book is the vagueness. I appreciate authors who allow my imagination to run free a little and to fill in the blanks. This was not that. I had to actually stop what I was reading a"
4811,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,I'm really terrible at reading series in sequence. That's why I like books that stand alone even if they build on an larger story sequence. The Dark is Rising (and the series of the same name) is an excellent sample of a book that stands strongly on its own and contributes to an entertaining series. Will Stanton gets a warning just before his 11th birthday (which happens to fall on Midwinter's day) that he must help defeat the Dark as he is the last of the Old Ones. Over the next many days he mu

I led them in discussing the story and we enjoyed looking at it closely and considering the Celtic mythology. At the end of it, though, I realized that it was a disappointing book because the main character, Will, isn't in charge of his fate. He's called the Sign Seeker, yet he doesn't really seek any of the signs. He doesn't even make any choices, even when he has to choose whether to give the signs to the bad guys or save"

How heavily it ties in with the season during which it is set. There are some great moments. I can see how reading it as a child or young teenager could be a really fun and exciting experience. But I have to say, reading as an adult, I found the story a little weak. Will comes by his powers a little too easily. He just knows what to do at the right moment and does it. Most of the charac"

4815,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,"I guess I felt that there was no struggle involved in this. In that way, Over Sea, Under Stone was a better book, because the children really had to fight their way to the end goal. In The Dark is Rising, I felt that absolutely everything was handed to Will. There was no self-enlightenment, no moment of ""Wow, I never would have believed I could do this."" Why should I feel anything but envy for a character who was destined to have this adventure from birth and never for one moment had to work har"

I think there was also just to many characters introduced at once, I kept forgetting who was who. This book could go on and on describing the details of a twig for pages at a time, and at other times there would be so little detail that i had trouble imagining/understanding what the heck they where talking about.

The premise was good, and she took classes from J.R.R.Tolkien when he was still teaching, but the generalities and abstracts just bored me to tears. I would find myself drifting off, trying to imagine what ""The Dark"" or ""The Light"" or ""The Stag"" or ""The Hunter"" looked like, and the narrative flow would be gone. Definitely not enough concrete description to hold onto. I kept falling asleep while reading this book. A bad sign indeed for me, a fantasy fan. Def"

But Merriman was back, so surely they would be, and Will Stanton holds his own as a major character.

4822,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"Overall I'd say I prefer stories about heroes who become, rather than who are chosen. But if it the author is relying on fate, how better than to use time travelers and incorporate all the myths of the British Isles? The compressed time period of the winter holidays works well.

4824,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"The only regret I have about this book is the best kind of regret: that I didn't read it sooner. Cooper writes in a way that captures perfectly the mysticism, poetry, and longing of Arthurian lore. Additionally, she wasn't afraid to craft a sense of dread. I do love a good foreboding. It's as in a good piece of music: it builds and builds and you want it to end right away and yet the tension is so intriguing, and when it finally resolves it is thrilling.

I never read it as a child, and as an adult, the biggest issue I have with it (and it's a huge issue) is there's no tension and no conflict. Everything is destined to occur, and there's no deviation from that. The main character doesn't make any choices, he just does what he is meant to do and more often even others in the book do things instead while the main character watches.

It had magic and adventures and stuff happening and fighting the evil dark etc. I really liked that there was clear and present danger from an enemy that was interesting.

4831,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,"The whole series is a dark magical journey just at the edge of what children can handle. I loved these books as a young adult (I think that means kid), and reread them recently. They don't work as well as an adult. Madeline L'Engle falls completely flat for me as an adult--C.S. Lewis is still magic, and Susan Cooper is somewhere in between. I highly recommend these books to people under 15. If you read these as an adult, they just seem like a children's version of every other fantasy novel. Of co"
4832,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,"So, the movie, the Seeker, totally mangled this series of five books, stripped them of all the folklore and Arthurian history, and turned the menace of the dark into a joke with a piss-poor actor. Skip it and read the books instead. The movie was mostly based on this book, which leaves out some very cool adventures and characters in the last three. Will discovers that he isn't just a middle boy in a large English family, but a wizard-type who must use his power to gather a series of symbols toge"
4834,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,"I listened to this, and maybe I would have liked it better if I'd read it instead. For some reason, my attention kept drifting as I was listening and I didn't ever get fully invested in the story or the characters. It's a series I've wanted to read for a while, but I'm going to stop with this second book for now, and if I decide to continue at some point, I will probably read rather than listen and see if that makes a difference."
4835,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"Probably my candidate for the childhood book that left its deepest mark on me, more than Narnia, more than Tolkien. Susan Cooper's writing may perhaps be best described as restrained, which is why I had so many fears for the movie (and was rightly worried, turns out) but she breathes elegance and wonder and so much meaning into every line of her work that I'm constantly amazed by it. It's so...clean, and powerful, and she manages to evoke giant explosions despite using such a light hand."
4836,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,"Not a bad story, just doesn't hold up well against some obvious comparisons. The ""learning"" phase of this story seems abrupt, and the central protagonist seems more otherworldly than relatable. The absence of character growing into a champion caused this to fall a bit flat for me. I hope my opinion improves with the rest of the series."
4837,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"Superb series of five books, this is #2, and is by far the best in the series: seriously creepy, fast-moving, and loads of fun, as young Will comes of age on his 11th birthday and enters into a magical world. Cooper's depiction of our world and the mystical one colliding and interweaving is wondrous. One of my favorite series to re-read."
4838,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,"This book is seriously creepy! In fact if the main character wasn't an eleven year old boy I would never have believed that this is a young adult book! I really liked it, the descriptions and scenery were steeped with exquisit details, and the uber creepiness of the whole thing kept me very involved until the very end! Great book!"
4839,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"Wow, it looks like I may have never rated any of the books in this series, even though I loved them all, and I read them obsessively. Strange. I did read them a few years before I joined goodreads, though. This one is my favorite in the series. 4 1/2 stars. My least favorite in the the series (the last one) is probably either a 3 or a 3 1/2."
4840,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,"In perfect honesty, I didn't finish this book. I know some of you love it. I know it's won awards. I liked it well enough, but it was the least-gripping read I've picked up in a long while. The other books in my did-not-finish shelf are there because I found them objectionable. This books isn't objectionable at all. Just... meh."
4841,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"I've always liked scary books. When I read (and reread) this one (best at midwinter), instead of thinking ""ooh, this book is scary"", I'm filled with a real sense of dread. Beyond being a fascinating story, it makes the reader consider deep questions about the meaning of good and evil, and how difficult it can be to recognize which is which."
4842,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,1,"I wanted to love this sooooo much but alas I didn't. Too many portals and magic that didn't make sense (I know it shouldn't have to, but it should). To be fair I wouldn't have liked this as a kid which is maybe who I didn't like it now. My nieces might though."
4843,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,"A children's series, but still enjoyable to read as an adult. The epic battle between the Light and Dark is decided by which side can acquire certain ancient artifacts - a grail, a harp, elemental signs, a crystal sword."
4844,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,The discussion of this whole series in Among Others has made me want to reread it. So now they're on the list.
4845,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"I've read this book about 5 times over the years... My most recent read was in response to the Seeker movie... So my copy went to my friend LisaMarie who loved the movie, but had never even heard of the books."
4847,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,"Not as fun as the first book in the series. I never felt much for Will, and I don't have a good feel for the magical world he's introduced to. Did a lot of skimming in the later pages. Still, I'll probably read the next book in the series."
4848,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,I'm always surprised that more people have not heard of this series. Susan Cooper is a masterful writer and these books are some of the great unsung works of fantasy. Fabulous stuff. Can't recommend these highly enough.
4849,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,"Fantasy which re-animates my local myths, such as Herne the Hunter, but loses a point for omitting Uffington... where St George slew the dragon and Alfred the Great defeated the Vikings and Kate Bush went Cloudbusting... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRHA9W..."
4850,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"I loved this book as much as I did when I first read it as a teenager. The characterization and elements of fantasy are excellent. I love snow imagery, and this book has a great deal of it. I'm looking forward to re-reading the rest of this series."
4851,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"My favourite children's author. I must have read this when I was about nine or ten. This is the best of the series, in my opinion. Also the one I read first. The Grey King was my other favourite. All set in Britain and involving a sort of pagan conflict between Light and Dark. Scary too."
4852,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"This is one of my all-time favs. I read this as an adult, but love the way Cooper weaves grail lore, Manicheaism, and English pagan knowledge into a story of boy who discovers he has a special destiny on the eve of his 11th birthday. Top notch read."
4853,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"I like all the books in this series--but The Dark is Rising was the best. Cooper's writing approaches poetry as she describes Will's education as an Old One. Her combination of history, myth and weather is spectacular."
4854,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,"I originally read this in junior high after my favorite librarian of all time, Mrs. Larson, recommended it, and I picked it up again recently to see if it would make a good gift for one of my nieces or nephews. I was enveloped in the magic of Cooper's story-telling. I was captivated."
4855,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,Wow! I liked this book even more the second time around. The coolest thing was the time travel since the Old Ones can go back and forth in time. I liked Will Stanton's character. I just wish he had helpers of his own age rather than only the adults. 4 solid stars.
4856,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,"Unique concepts - but boring read. The fact that the character thinks clinically like an adult and suffers heavily from the ""Superman"" syndrome makes him extremely unsympathetic for me. I read the book after the movie, which I liked a lot - but was disappointed. Sorry."
4857,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,read aloud with the 9 year old.

4861,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"One of the great fantasy series ever. Notice I didn't say ""for children"". This series is for everyone, with unforgettable characters (including faithful Gurgi!). What really makes this series is Taran's journey from a hot-headed, stubborn youth to a man fit to be king of Prydain. The most moving scenes of the series are in ""Taran Wanderer"", when Taran learns that to be a hero with a sword in your hand is no more worthy than to be a blacksmith, weaver or potter.

The first three books were charming. I loved the combination of high epic characters and characters designed to mock high epic. The fair folk were particularly entertaining when compared to Tolkien-style epic. You could write a book on Eilonwyn's role as an adventure heroine. She's enormously complex and layered in a collection of characters that aspires to two dimensions. As the ser"

But the journey inside the land of Prydain was certainly a long one. It began with The Book of Three, where Taran was still a teenage boy, eager to see the world, to become a hero, with his prideful attitude. Along the way, in The Black Cauldron, The Castle of Llyr, Taran Wanderer, with all the journeys and events, Taran grew up to become a man, kind, compassionate,"

On behalf of all Prydain fans I'd like to ask: Where's our live-action movie version of this? All we have is one very cute (but let's face it, also dated and somewhat inaccurate) Disney animation film!

It's a nice mix of Arthurian legend; Welsh legend, vocabulary, and locale; and Tolkien-type fantasy.

It had a huge influence on my love of fantasy fiction. Now, re-reading it as an adult, I can see that it's not flawless, but nonetheless it's still a great adventure with wonderful characters.

They began a lifelong affection for fantasy novels, specifically fantasy series. It's natural to utter the name Tolkein while discussing these books due to numerous parallels between Middle Earth and The Realm of Prydain, not to mention both author's utilization the multi-volume format.

They tell a wonderful fantasy story, much younger than The Lord of the Rings to which some try to compare it. While I can't say that I find it anywhere near as good as that epic, it is a worthy nominee to the crown of best Youth and YA fantasy. Adults can and I would think that if they are fantasy fans, will enjoy it also. The books are loosely based in Welsh mythology but they don't strain to stay with it and tell a story that's fu"

4878,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"The Chronicles of Prydain is really a great fantasy series. While J.R.R. Tolkien (the creator of The Hobbit and its sequel, The Lord of the Rings trilogy) may have started the High Fantasy genre, the Prydain series author, Lloyd Alexander was just as much a visionary as Tolkien himself once was. The Prydain story is an epic tale that focuses on the adventures of an assistant pig-keeper named Taran who dreams of becoming a great warrior and hero.

It's sad -- I wanted to like them more. But they just continually felt... Clunky and derivative. The characters were mostly one-dimensional (Gurgi and Fflewder Fflam, in particular, always spoke in repetitive turns of phrase, making them feel like Mad Libs more than people). Alexander skipped over so many details that it felt like he either wasn't paying attention or hadn't"
4883,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,"Lloyd Alexander's Chronicles of Prydain are beloved childhood books for me. I can probably blame on them my early obsession with all things Welsh and my emphatic preference for pre-Malory Arthuriana. And also, probably, my immense fondness for crafting-based training montages (see L.E. Modesitt's entire Recluse series.)

I always feel this series starts somewhat weakly, written for a younger audience without the depth that other authors (C.S. Lewis) lend to their children's books. However, every time I come back to the books I find that I love them all. As the series progresses the books and the characters mature. Though many of the images are familiar from other works (it was, in part, based on Welsh mythology) they lose none of their significance for being repetiti"
4907,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,3,"I'm not a fantasy person. I have a working knowledge of fantasy tropes and stories and works, and I've seen LOTR and I love fairy tales, but I don't really enjoy reading fantasy all too much, and this series is an example of why. There's not enough structure here, too much roaming around whining about what will become of us? I love the part about the cauldron and the Horned King, and some of the side characters, but the lead here is so boring and dumb that I really don't remember much else about"
4908,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,3,"When I was a kid, for a time Lloyd Alexander was tied with Dickens as my favourite author. He’s best known for this series, The Chronicles of Prydain, which is a children’s high-fantasy, epic-quest, boys’ adventure kind of thing. In retrospect, that sounds really dull. I say meh to boys’ adventures; and high fantasy seems ill-suited to children’s stories, because the world-building ends up too slight and sanitary. Anyway, even when I was a kid, I preferred a different Alexander series: the Westm"
4909,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,"I read these for the first time in fifth grade, reread them about 7 years ago, and one per night this past week. I really like these, and though they are kids' books, it is fun sometimes to take a break from Nibley, Heidegger, anf Foucault, and delve into some good clean fun. I think that of all books non-religious, this set really shaped who I am. I really wanted to be like Taran in this book when I was young, and wanted to gain the same wisdom and strength that he did, since I started out as h"
4910,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,"My library recently acquired Lloyd Alexander's papers, and after attending a lecture about him, I have wanted to reread these favorites from my childhood. Ah, these did not disappoint! This is classic fantasy, similar to Lord of the Rings at times, and as an adult I enjoyed Alexander's messages about the type of people we need to be. This edition included some short stories set in Prydain, which provided good background information for the series."
4911,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"I remember reading these books many years ago and quite enjoying them, though most of the detail of the story had escaped me. On re-reading, I again enjoyed them a great deal, and not, I think, for reasons of nostalgia; they are simply well-written and tell an enjoyable tale, recalling to mind the similarly excellent Earthsea books that are ""for children"" but not quite. Glad I picked up this collection to give them another go."
4912,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,"I read each of these books individually, but it's easily one of the best fantasy series in existence geared towards children. It should have the same amount of recognition as the classic Chronicles of Narnia by C. S. Lewis. In regards to plot elements, many similarities can be found between these novels and Tolkien's The Lord of the Ring . However, there are striking differences and this is an excellent gateway to the fantasy genre for a younger crowd."
4913,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,"I read almost this entire series as a kid (I didn't want to finish the last book and have the series be over), and I loved it. I read it as an adult and loved it still the same. Taran Wanderer is my favorite, but as a set this is deserving of 4 stars. A must-read for kids!"
4914,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,"My grade 4 teacher, Mr. Baltgailis read a few chapters of these books to us everyday after lunch. He made the characters come alive and this series left a great impression on me. Twenty years after, I spent quite a bit of time hunting through used book stores searching for this set, which I finally found. Same edition as what he read to us - very nostalgic! I haven't yet found the time to sit down and reread the series, but looking forward to getting to it again soon. :)"
4915,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"This, alongside, the Chronicles of Narnia, was my gateway drug into fantasy and medieval studies. I was seven. It was the greatest thrill of my young life to delve deeply into Taran's adventures. To this day, 31 years later, I remember exactly where I was, exactly what I was wearing, exactly what I was snacking on, and exactly how I felt, when I was reading each of these books. I wore my first set out."
4916,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"This is a series from my childhood which I find unforgettable, and one I regularly re-read with my children. I find it to be a classic tale of friendship, adventure, and learning how to be there for your friends when they need you; perfect for young ears and hearts, even today. So thank you Sir Lloyd Alexander for your tales which continue to enchant me today just like when I was a wee chit of a lad and which I share with my lads and lass. Happy reading everyone!"
4917,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"I like the Narnia books, but these books really take the place in my heart some people reserve for Lewis' work. Taran, Gurgi, Eilonwy, Gwydion. . .they're like old friends, and they've stood up to many readings and many years. The Black Cauldron is my personal favorite, but each of them is great in its own way. In the end, the uniting theme is how even Assistant Pig-Keepers can, with hard work and good friends, grow into true men."
4918,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,"This series boasts a Newberry Award and a Newberry Honor! Young Taran, Assistant Pig-Keeper of Caer Dallben, finds himself swept into an ever-accelerating current of danger and excitement. This fast-paced yet well-written story encourages strong character, built through choice-and-consequence, while highlighting the cost of violence, conceit, and cowardice. A hero’s journey adults can also appreciate!"
4919,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"This was one of my favorite series as a young reader and Lloyd Alexander is one of my favorite YAL authors. I just finished rereading ""The Black Cauldron"" today and loved it! The books are full of adventure and curious characters. They also explore what it really means to be a hero and the true nature of honor. These books have deep moral/philosophical lessons, while being entertaining, too. I didn't want to set ""The Black Cauldron"" down. I'm going to continue rereading the series :)"
4920,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"I loved these books when I was a kid. They're a sweeping fantasy tale of good v. evil rooted in myth, and also a funny, affectionate coming of age story. I was afraid they wouldn't hold up when I returned to them a few years ago, but they were still wonderful. Princess Eilonwy is one of the best girl-best-friends characters ever - and she gets the best witty lines. The movie The Black Cauldron was very loosely based on these books (very loosely)."
4921,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"I originally picked these up because I was curious where the inspiration for Disney's The Black Cauldron came from. Boy are these books SO much better than what they did with the film! Yet another fantasy series that takes the normal tropes of scrappy young boy turned hero to a much more real and relatable level. Taran is such a wonderful protagonist, full of real flaws and all the sort of feelings everyone has when they are young and want to do great things. A must read for any fantasy lover!"
4922,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,"I first read this series in school and still enjoy reading it again and again. It is easy to like the characters and care about what happens to them, something not often found in stories written for the pre-teen age group. The main character Taran learns that it is not as important where you start out in life, it is how you go forward on your journey that counts. Fun to read to young children because they REALLY enjoy saying ""Hen Wen is an ORACULAR pig!"""
4923,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"Perhaps the greatest fantasy series for the child/YA crowd ever. Harry Potter has nothing on Prydain. A coherent, contained, universe. Interesting characters following a long Bildungsroman arc. A solidly feminist female character. High fantasy mixes with fairytale storytelling in the best quasi-British fantasy world this side of Tolkein."
4924,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"I read this series for the first time in Junior High and then read them again while in college. This was the first SERIES I had ever read. I believe the first time I read them, I read the entire series in less than 30 days. I can't say i learned a whole lot from the books although they were pretty entertaining. The typical Good versus Evil and all..."
4925,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"It's been a long time since I read these, middle school actually, but it was my first real intro to Fantasy, and I still remember how excited I was as I was enveloped by these stories. I've been hesitant ever since to re-read them for fear of losing the magical feelings I still so vividly remember from my childhood."
4926,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,"The ending was too Tolkien-ish and a little sad but it was a fabulous series overall. The Black Cauldron is my favorite out of all of them, and Taran Wanderer was good in terms of character development but as a story not as interesting as the others. I really loved The Castle of Llyr although it was more of a girl’s story. I can see why this series is a classic."
4927,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"This series was formative for me as a writer and as a human being! :) Taran and his friends got me through my childhood, and the mystical Welsh setting inspired me decades later to set one of my own novels in Wales. In short, every kid should read the Prydain books before they leave middle school. It's a classic."
4928,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,These are a great fantasy set. I loved these books so much I named my first born son after the main character Taran. So many people only know about the movie the Black Cauldron that Disney did which is LOOSELY based on the first and second books combined. If you have kids these are a must read 2 have Newberry awards--one an honor the other the award winner.
4929,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"I just retread this series for the third or fourth time, I absolutely love them. Fans of the Chronicles of Narnia, The Hobbit, and Harry Potter must stop what they are doing and grab these books. You will be drawn in from the first meeting of Taran, the assistant pig keeper, as he plunges into adventures he is anything but ready for."
4930,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"My dad read this to me as a kid and I loved the stories. When the box set was re-released my wife and I purchased it and read it during long car trips. It's written for young adults, but we enjoyed reading it. A great coming of age story, overcoming challenges, interpersonal relationships, and good vs. evil."
4931,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"These books, alongside The Hobbit, changed the way I saw the world when I was younger. It made me want to travel through woods and forests in search of adventure and action. These books made me who I am. Easily read by children, but should be read by everyone of all ages. One of the few series' that are truly ageless. More should be written this well. Read it."
4932,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,"Excellent YA series (much better than Narnia). Has a great children's story with heroic characters doing heroic things, but there are a lot of dilemmas that the younger reader might miss. I especially liked ""The Black Cauldron"" and "" Taran Wanderer ."""
4933,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,3,"I struggle a bit with how to rate these older children's books. The style is quite a bit different then now. Instead of the stories that appeal to all ages (so that they sell more books), these are actually more geared for kids. Not as much filler and not very subtle characters or plot. That having been said. I really liked this whole set. But it didn't make me stay up at night reading it."
4934,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,This was one of my first books that actually captured my imagination. It was the first time a book that my Grandma loved that was a JF book actually got me excited. I could not even get myself to read Chronicles of Narnia. But I could read The Chronicles of Prydain. I felt that I could truly identify with the young pig farmer who is the hero of the series.
4935,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,"1 The Book of Three 2 The Black Cauldron 3 The Castle of Llyr 4 Taran Wanderer 5 The High King I read all five books in High School, they are lots of fun. I love Eilonwy and the way she speaks it's great."
4936,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"It's a very charming fantasy series with a great sense of humor, likable characters, and culminates in a painful coming-of-age story for main character Taran the Assistant Pig-Keeper. It's also heavily based on Welsh mythology, folklore, and naming conventions. I'd recommend it to anyone, of any age."
4937,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"Oh, I just love these books. The Castle of Llyr is probably the very first fantasy novel I ever read, and what a fun one it was! I like to think of these books as Tolkein for kids. They have all the components of an epic fantasy, complete with the Campbellian hero's journey, and honestly, how can you pass up a set whose hero is known as Taran, Assistant Pig-Keeper? I just love it."
4938,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,These are an excellent choice for reading aloud. The characters each have a very particular voice and the story is fantastical yet believable. A hero is nothing more than a searcher who must make some critical decisions. Making those decisions requires some heart and soul and making mistakes requires some humanity.
4939,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,I read these books for the first time when I was in sixth grade. I remember waiting to get the next one from the library after I had finished the previous seemed like forever. This series was in part responsible for my love of fantasy novels. I personally think that they are wonderful books for people of any age (in fact I just bought them to read again 10 years later!).
4940,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"Before Harry Potter and Hermione, there were Taran and Eilonwy. Alexander's series was my Harry Potter--one of those fantasy series that helped make me a lifelong reader. Now, I am revisiting the series with my own kids. Like much lasting young adult fantasy, it is essentially a myth/quest narrative in which the hero and heroine come of age."
4941,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,"The 2nd and 3rd books are most fanciful and engaging. 1st has its fancy. The rest, and sometimes the first three, were often too practical for my taste. I actually do enjoy this series, but for a high fantasy, I am surprised by how practically minded it is. Beautiful wisdom nuggets scattered delightfully through."
4942,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"This was my gateway drug into the world of fantasy fiction. Yes, it belongs on the MG shelf, but if you weren't fortunate enough to read this in middle school, you should definitely read this now. Fantastic stuff. (Also, highly recommended for those precocious young readers who are not quite ready for Harry Potter yet)."
4943,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,"A delightful series. In truth, this is one long fairy tale, which is long enough that the main character Taran is really quite developed in the end. The target age is probably 7-11, but if (like me) you genuinely enjoy reading books which are innocent and delightful, then you may like this series."
4944,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"My Mom read this series to me when I was quite young, and I loved it. I enjoyed the books just as much when I re-read them a few years later. Lloyd Alexander will always be one of my favorite authors."
4945,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,"Oustanding young adult fantasy which holds up over time. I re-read the series a few years ago, without expecting much, and discovered a new layer of humor and adult concerns which had, unsurprisingly, bypassed me as a child. Highly recommended."
4946,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"I have read these books a couple times over the years. Taran wanderer is my favorite one but they are all good and well written. Written for younger readers, but still a fun and enjoyable read for older readers as well."
4947,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"These are the first books my husband and I read together. We're reading them aloud again and I'd forgotten how much I love them. The story is good, the characters are memorable, and there are little nuggets of truth and things to learn. Love these books!"
4948,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"I read this series in fifth grade. I loved it more than Narnia and Lord of the Rings. Years later, I realized it is very grounded in Celtic lore. I haven't reread it, because I know as an adult I won't feel the same sense of wonder, and I want it to remain in my imagination the way it is."
4949,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,3,"These books had a beloved role in my childhood. I especially loved the drama of the black cauldron. Even for one of Lloyd's typical heroes, I find Teran annoying, and dislike how in the end, Eilonway dimmed her shine--literally--to stay with him."
4950,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"This series of books has the same feel as The lord of the rings series, but personally I liked these much better."
4951,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"Travel to the magical land of Prydain where you'll meet an assistant pig keeper, a furry, hungry creature, a lying bard, and a girl who has a magical bauble. Then you'll meet the bad guys who have a black cauldron that creates armies of the living dead. Freaky!"
4952,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"Inspired by the classic book of Welsh mythology, The Mabinogion , this series follows the adventures of Taran, assistant pig keeper, in his quest to find his destiny. Full of adventure, humor, and wisdom, I consider this series one of my ""5 fantasy series every child/teen should know!"""
4953,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,"One of my favorite fantasy series. Always gives me a sense of the possible. Characters are an interesting mix. Humor lightens everything in this world of bravery, friendship and tests of character. Hints of many legends and stories are woven into a tapestry specific to Alexander and Prydain."
4954,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,"This is YA before the genre was coined, and so stands out for its sheer subtle hero themes - the young boy hungering to be a true hero, and his path to self-discovery. There is no clear ladder that goes to being a leader, and this book stays true to that."
4955,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"What a great set of books! These books have excellent characters, adventure and great development. Together the comrades have to go through trials that allow them to learn and grow, to become confident in who they are and grow ever thankful for the simple things."
4956,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,My favorite series when I was a kid I liked it better than the Lord of the Rings and far better than the Chronicles of Narnia. I fell in love with the characters and was genuinely sad when I finished the last book and couldn't live in their world any longer... sigh
4957,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,It doesn't get much better than the Black Cauldron books! I think I especially like that each book isn't a repeat of the one before. Each takes it's own place. And you can't read just one of them. You've got to do the whole thing.
4958,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,"Dad read these to me as a kid, saw them in the library and thought I would give them a second read and enjoyed it almost as much as the first time through. I already can't wait until Desmond is old enough for me to read them to him!"
4959,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"My favorite fantasy books growing up; I re-read them as an adult and still loved them. It was a ton of fun to recently read the Mabinogi, the old Welsh epic tales, and see how much they'd influenced the Chronicles of Prydain."
4960,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"I was already starting to steer toward fantasy as my genre of choice, but this entire series cemented that desire. It is a great introduction into fantasy for young readers, and I highly encourage them being immersed in its wonderful story."
4961,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,"Fun, childish, light hearted often, becoming more serious over the course of the series. Many of the descriptions felt overly repetitive and eventually one could predict how Alexander would describe most any character or situation. Especially recommended to younger fantasy readers."
4962,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,I read the series with my boys and we all thoroughly enjoyed them. I liked that the characters were well developed and made appearances throughout all of the books. Recommended for your young readers!
4963,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"One of the most worthwhile, edifying series for kids there is."
4964,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,"I loved these as a kid. No idea what they are about anymore, but pretty sure I still have this exact set on my shelves. Will save for my kids, eventually!"
4965,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,My review can be found by clicking here
4966,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,So fun for family reading time as long as you can get the Welsh and British accents down! A must read for any fan of ancient folklore from the British Isles.
4968,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"This was one of the only pure fantasy books I read in high school, but it was captivating and very enjoyable. I couldn't put this series down."
4969,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,How did I never hear of these tales before now? Based on Welsh myth and quite well written.
4970,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,3,"I think I would like this series more if I was a young teen, but nonetheless I still enjoyed them and recommend them."
4971,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,My mom read this series aloud to me and my siblings when I was in elementary school. I loved it.
4972,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,One of my favorites as a kid. Read the series several times.
4973,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,Review coming soon!
4974,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,I recently re-read these. They are fantastic books...all of them.
4975,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,As a child I read and reread these books. Books two and five more than twenty times. :-) I still read them.
4976,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"I loved this fantasy series! The main character, Taran, has a lot of faults but really tries hard. There's a lot of humor in it, too. A good series for young people."
4977,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,I loved this series. Really great character development for Taran and a true series of good vs. evil. I think it was the fourth book that was my favorite (it's been some time since I read them).
4978,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,Great series based on welsh and celtic myth and folklore.
4979,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,The High King was my all-time favorite book as a child.
4980,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,I blazed through these. They are so fun. I love that they are based on Welsh mythology it gives them a timelessness.
4981,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,A series I still remember fondly from when I read it as a kid.
4982,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,"Good series. I remembered some of it from when I read it long ago. The ending made me a little sad, as a lot of fantasy series like this do."
4983,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,I can definitely see why it's a classic after all these years. Lots of good messages carved into the fantasy story. Really good for kids.
4984,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,"I loved this Y.A. fantasy series. Coming of age, etc. Good vs. evil. Great characters. 5 books in the series."
4985,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"This is another wonderful series from my childhood that I never tired of re-reading. I no longer have copies of these books, but will probably buy them again soon to re-read again."
4986,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,I absolutely LOVED these books as a kid! I can't wait to reread them.
4987,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"the first of this series is ""the book of three"". this is a fantasy with good working to overcome evil and so much more."
4988,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,Even better than I remembered. Great bedtime reading material (to kids).
4989,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,Much better than the movie! Loved it!
4990,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,I love these books! A great series to read out loud to your children. They teach very valuable lessons and are fun and interesting. Love love love!
4991,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,"All the books in one set. Nice youth read I enjoyed it and recommend it. Good intro for the right young person to ""heroic fantasy""."
4992,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"I frickin' loved these books when I was in fourth grade. I don't really remember anything about them. There was a pig, maybe? But DAMN they were good."
4993,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,"Loved this series as a tween, should really reread it as an adult. Too bad Disney made such a terrible cartoon out of it."
4994,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"I love these books to much to talk about them, but this girl manages pretty well."
4995,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,An engaging and thoughtful series of adventures.
4996,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"God, I loved these books so much!"

4999,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,I love this series...
5000,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,"Definitely want to re-read these, but remember loving them when I was younger"
5001,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,this series was my introduction to reading fantasy novels. extremely well written and enjoyablr to read even as an adult today. love love love it!!!
5002,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,I loved this whole series. Definitely a must read for 10 year olds and up!
5003,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,Lloyd Alexander wrote these tales for adolescents but I just read them for the first time a few years ago. The Prydian Chronicles is a very enjoyable collection of fantasy tales.
5004,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"A rereading of a classic childhood series of fantasy stories based on Welch mythology, it offers the same themes as most such stories, but in an enjoyable way."
5005,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,"7/10 This series was an easy, charming read. Deus ex machina played too large of a role in a couple of the books, but did not ruin the story."
5006,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,Because the chronicles of Pyrdain are awesome.
5007,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,This is one of my FAVORITE young adult book series. I've read it again and again.
5008,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,A great series I read when I was 10 in the vacuum that followed reading CS Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia. It was a very welcome find.
5009,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,After Lord of the Rings these were my favorite.
5011,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"A coming of age story full of heroism, sacrifice, and adventure, based on Welsh mythology."
5012,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"Out of all the fantasy books I have read, this series is still my favorite. Very well written and a great adventure."
5013,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"Okay, it's for young adults, but it's so great!"
5014,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,This set: The Book of Three; The Black Cauldron; The Castle of Illyr; Taran Wanderer; The High King; is a great adventure of magic and mystery. Great fantasy for children and adults
5015,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,One of my three favorite series of fiction Books
5016,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,"Give yourself a treat and read this series. I had forgotten how much fun it is. Until I had to read it again, so that I was ready to read it to the latest generation in the family."
5017,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,My favorite series as an elementary school kid. Introduced these to my son with great effect.
5018,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,LOVED these throughout my childhood!
5019,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,"Literary snobs are not allowed to scoff. Not only is this a very fun read with lots of humor, but it's also research. I'm writing a fantasty story, therefore I should be reading them."
5020,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"Loved this series as a kid, it's such a classic adventure/quest story."
5021,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,"Honestly, I don't remember much about these books, beyond the fact that I enjoyed them immensely. And that Gurgi and the cat and the bard are three of the coolest characters ever."
5022,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,Very much enjoyed reading this series to my five year old.
5023,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,currently reading... for the 17th time.
5024,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,Classic fantasy--read these out loud to my daughter when she was younger and we both loved them tremendously.
5025,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,I liked it better than Narnia. Outstanding series.
5026,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,One of the greats. Really. Is it reflective of Tolkien? Yes. Do I care? Not at all.
5027,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,My favorite books from Jr. High
5028,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,I loved reading this series when I was a kid. LOTR style!
5029,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,I loved these books in 5th or 6th grade and it's been a joy to listen to the audiobooks again with my kids. Alexander delivers action-packed adventure tales based on Welsh legends.
5030,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,3,I did not actually have the boxed set. I had the SFBC omnibus edition. Good stuff. The first few felt a bit teen-oriented. I enjoyed the last book the most.
5031,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,Aah!!! Gurgi!!!Still brings a lump to my throat; over twenty years later.
5032,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,3,Reasonably good fantasy although fairly childish despite its placement on the adult side of the library.
5033,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,I loved these books!
5034,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,Before there was Harry Potter and JK Rowling there was Taran and Lloyd Alexander. Alexander was one of my favorite authors as a kid and it's fun to go back and re-read his works.
5035,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,This book is a great read!
5036,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,Excellent series. Should be read by everyone.
5037,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"One of favorite fantasy series, a cousin to C.S. Lewis' Narnia series."
5038,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,Some of my favorite children's lit. characters.
5039,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,The Book of Three- started 9/10 finished 9/24/17
5040,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,A favorite from childhood. Still a good read.
5041,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"Very fun. There is a Disney movie that tries to put all the books in one but it's kind of scarey and not so great at telling the story. The girl in this book is AWESOME, the boy is ok."
5042,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,"This was one of my earliest introductions to YA fantasy back in 5th grade, and I remember enjoying every book in the series quite a lot. Don't remember any details now, unfortunately."
5043,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,"Book 1 - 3 Stars, Read 5/28/13 Book 2 - 3 Stars, Read 5/31/13 Book 3 - 4 Stars, Read 6/2/13 Book 4 - 4 Stars, Read 6/4/13 Book 5 - 4 Stars, Read 6/5/13"
5045,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"NO SPOILERS I read this series when I was about 12 years old. My school librarian was pissed that I wasn't reading enough. It was a chore for me. I wasn't interested in anything my teachers gave me. Around that time, I had been playing Link's Awakening on my gameboy, and I was really into it. So I just told her, ""Give me something to read like this Zelda game."" Once I explained to her what that game was, she handed me ""The Book of Three."" After two or three chapters, I was hooked. I think I might"
5046,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,"God this takes me back! This was the very first Fantasy series I ever read and I think it has been around 18 years since I read it but so many memories of reading this book come to mind upon writing this review. So, a little backstory. I was about 12 years old when I read this series and back in those days our teacher used to assign us book reports. The book reports were pretty basic. Every month we had to pick a book, read it and then give a short presentation to the class. Well, I think I pick"
5047,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"Revisited these for the first time since high school. They're like a perfectly rich, unfrosted chocolate cake: traditional and hit the spot. If you're a fan of Welsh or British history, fantasy, or the Hero's Journey I don't see how you wouldn't like them. Fun Fact: I have finally realized that the creature Gurgi is what a talking dog would actually be."
5048,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,"Absolutely charming and delightful. I wish I had read this when I was a child. Over the course of the 5 books, Taran starts as a child and grows into a man. The subject matter starts pretty innocently and gets darker and darker, raising the stakes with each book. Harry Potter did the same thing."
5049,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,The Chronicles of Prydain is a wondeful series full of fantasy and andveture. These books are about a young boy named Trana who enbarks on a dangerous adventure in order to save the lands of Prydain from the evil queen Achren and the war-lord Arawn. Along the way he meets many allies such as Gurgi who help him along his journey to save Prydain. This book is best for reader craving adventure and suspense in every book. It is also for readers interested in fictional senarios and kingdoms. I loved
5050,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,These are the books that made me a fan of reading and fantasy.
5052,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,This is probably one of the greatest fantasy series ever written. The character development and plots were absolutely fantastic. We got to see Taran grow up and deal with heartbreak and realise what it truly means to be a hero. I cannot recommend this series enough.
5053,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"The Chronicles of Prydain was one of the epic fantasy series I read growing up. Alongside Narnia and, a little later, Lord of the Rings. Unlike the other two series, Taran of Caer Dallben goes looking for adventure. His eagerness to prove himself gets him into trouble with others more often than not. Some lessons Taran learns are far harder than others and by the end of each book, he becomes harder to associate with the child at the beginning of the Book of Three. Unlike the Disney film, the vil"
5054,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,"Re-reading whatever I can get my hands on lately, I knew that this was going to be an enjoyable romp into my past. I can't remember when I first read this series, but I have clear memories of looking for everything by Alexander after I finished the series. I wish the sexism and extreme dearth of good female characters - 3 wise witches, 1 headstrong princess, 1 bad witchqueen eventually turned good and one oracular pig do not make nearly enough in the way of females when the entire series is over"
5055,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"A great far ranging, far traveling adventure! This series of books by Lloyd Alexander are such a treasure. I recall trips to the library, most likely middle school at the beginning, when I borrowed the large hardcover versions. The story never gets old for me, even though I know the stories by heart. Now I just need to convince my oldest daughter to try out the series. I may need an Exchanter's help to make that happen! I recommend this book to anyone who likes a grand adventure!"
5056,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,"Did you ever see ""The Black Cauldron"" old Disney animated movie?? Well these are the books that was based on. A couple years ago I read these 5 books for the first time. Wonderful stories about trusting yourself and your abilities. Being patient. Accepting yourself for what you are and being content with that, and being a true friend. Don't watch the movie again--it really is bad, read the books instead! Re-read the nooks this summer trying to get my 10 year old into them. He hasn't read them ye"
5057,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,3,"""I love 'cried' as a dialog tag,"" cried Mr. Alexander as he read yet another page of his book, ""I just can't get enough of it. The next book I write I will use it even more than once or twice per page."" Other than that the extreme repetitive use of 'cried', a casual reader such as myself would have enjoyed the book maybe a little more. Umm, it is like when someone... Well, you know, it's like when someone repeatedly uses the word 'like' or 'ummmm'. Once you hear it, you can't stop focusing on it"
5058,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"I devoured these books when I was young. Quality fantasy reading for like middle school age, give or take a grade. To be honest, thinking back on the series, it remindes me a lot of Weis/Hickman Dragonlance Chronicles trilogy (Dragons of: Autumn Twilight, Winter Night, & Spring Dawning) but for a much younger audience and with a Welsh influence."
5059,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"This book series has always been one of my favorites. The characters are engaging and complex. The plot is strong and hooked me from beginning to end. It’s got such a beautifully written epic hero’s tale and honestly, I put it up there with the Chronicles of Narnia and Lord of the Rings as some of my favorites of all time."
5060,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"I haven't read these in about fourteen years but when I did I thought they were fantastic. I don't know if I would feel that way today so I'm scared to revisit them, but as it stands right now, they're still amongst my favourites."
5061,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,"Great Series A great set of fantasy books intended for younger audiences, but readable by all ages. Watching the main characters grow almost makes you feel a part of the story, especially watching Taran mature with each book. Highly recommend."
5062,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,"***Warning**** Mention of rape and discussion of such follows. I gave this book four stars so obviously I did enjoy it. There are actually many, many enjoyable elements to this book and I promise to get to them in a moment... I found myself so COMPLETELY annoyed with Daughter of the Forest though I really enjoyed the book. We are treated to the terrible acts committed against Sorcha and it's rather graphic at moments. Yet when it comes to consensual, loving sex - nothing. Fade to black the moment"
5063,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,"First let me give a shout out to the rapists and dog killer/abusers in the book with a gif below. Now let's crack on with a short review 😊 So Sorcha was not born the seventh son. She was born a daughter with 6 older brothers. Finbar, Liam, Cormack, Conor, Padriac and Diarmid. These brothers take care of Sorcha and I forgot to mention she's a healer! Well, one day their father brings home the evil sorceress that is to be the wicked stepmother! Yeah, she puts an ole curse on the brothers and such."
5064,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"Reviewed by: Rabid Reads 4.5 stars Everything I could tell you about Daughter of the Forest by Juliet Marillier can be summed up in a single paragraph from the story itself: If I were telling this tale, and it were not my own, I would give it a neat, satisfying ending . . . In such stories, there are no loose ends. There are no unraveled edges and crooked threads. Daughters do not give their hearts to the enemy. The wicked do not simply disappear, taking with them the satisfaction of vengeance. Yo"
5065,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"I want to call this book a combination of Kushiel's Dart and Assassin's Apprentice . But in reality, Daughter of the Forest is a category all its own. A gorgeous mix of historical fiction and fantasy, an insightful hero’s journey with a dash of romance. It’s been some time since I’ve had the pleasure of reading a book so deserving of five stars. Sorcha, daughter of the forest, tells her own tale in this book about an ancient Celtic/British feud and the magical undertones that influence it. She is"
5066,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"I love Ireland and love retellings, so this was all sorts of enchanting. Sorcha is the seventh daughter of a seventh son and has 6 older brothers. A few of them communicate mentally and there are hints of fae and magic woven throughout the druidic Irish setting. It's a long story, but basically young Sorcha's brothers are turned into swans and she has to remain silent for years as she spins a thorny plant into shirts so they can be human again. It's a truly miserable, isolating task and the story"
5067,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"“All that he had of her was his memory,where he held every moment,every single moment that she had been his.That was all he had,to keep out the loneliness.” Daughter of the Forest is one of those books.The ones that are scored on my heart ,the ones that caused both my awe and respect for the story and for the author. For it takes a tremendous amount of talent and soul to write such a book. I recall the tale of the Six Swans ,I remember being a little girl watching the animated version,and it made m"
5068,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"“Real life is not quite as it is in stories. In the old tales, bad things happen, and when the tale has unfolded and come to its triumphant conclusion, it is as if the bad things had never been. Life is not as simple as that, not quite.” --Juliet Marillier, “Daughter of the Forest” The above quote, hands down, sums up “Daughter of the Forest” for me. Yes, this is a fairy tale, but it also speaks truth about life: about how once you go forward, you cannot go back to the beginning…because things are"
5069,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"4.7 stars Aside from a couple of minor qualms, Daughter of the Forest is pretty much an example of an almost perfect debut novel. This book is a beautiful retelling of the Celtic ""Swans"" myth, which has been familiar to me since childhood through the Hans Christian Andersen 's version - The Wild Swans . Sorcha is the seventh child and the only daughter of Lord Colum of Sevenwaters. When Colum remarries after being widowed for almost 13 years, the evil stepmother (and witch) puts a dreadful spell on"
5070,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,It has taken me forever to get to this review because I was just not sure how I could possibly pack everything I felt during this book into coherent words stuck together that would even possibly do it justice . I still don’t think that I will be able to manage it but I’ll try. Daughter of the Forest (DoF) takes an old Irish legend/fairy tale and breathes new life into it. I was not familiar at all with the original version of this story so I cannot comment on how closely it follows but I will say
5071,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"Incredible. I know I've said I've been speechless when reading books before, but this time, I genuinely don't have the words to express what a masterpiece this novel is. I actually finished this novel early today morning, at around 1:30, but it was only at 2:30-ish that I actually got up to go to sleep. I couldn't get this story out of my head; I simply kept thinking about it. If Juliet Marillier hadn't already made a fan out of me with Heart's Blood, then I'd be tripping over myself to fall at"
5072,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"I have always loved the fairy tale about the sister with numerous brothers who had a wicked stepmother who enchanted her brothers to turn them into birds. The number of brothers and the type of birds can vary. I have seen it with ravens and with swans. In Daughter of the Forest, Ms. Marillier used the version in which the heroine has six brothers and they are all turned into swans. I must say I truly enjoyed (and devoured) this heartbreaking, emotionally wrenching novel based on that fairy tale."
5073,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,"The pages of this book flow like a river of sorrow and anguish, and pain, and loneliness, courage, and hope, and an unyielding love. But the stream is strong so once the current of the Six Swans retelling has caught you, you will be there, held like under a spell and unable to stop. It is not an easy tale but, oh, a beautiful one. The fairy tale is known, and so I am not spoiling anything by telling you that Daughter of the Forest tells us a story of Sorcha, the youngest child of the Lord of Seve"
5074,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"What a breathtakingly beautiful book! It’s hard to describe Daughter of the Forest. It is a fantasy, a historical, and a romance. It reads like a fable or a fairy tale. It has all the elements of a fairy tale – the evil stepmother, a fairy godmother (sort of), an enchantment, an impossible task to accomplish, a prince charming, and a happily ever after. This has to be my all time favorite book now. I was captivated by the story, mesmerized by the voice of Sorcha, our heroine. I did not put this b"
5075,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"How do you know when a book is a great book? - When the line between reality and fiction begins to blur, so that you could be sitting on a sunny balcony off a busy street, and still feel like you are in the cool, dark confines of the ancient Irish forests. When you are struck with sympathetic muteness because talking means the difference between life and death for the heroine, and it takes an actual, conscious effort to unlock your throat and answer when someone calls out to you. When you sudden"
5077,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,What a fabulous start to what I hope is going to be a 5 star series. One of my favorite books so far this year!
5078,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,"Trigger Warning: Sexual Assault It was very difficult for me to give this book a star rating. First off, I want to say that I enjoyed this story a lot and found it very enchanting. I didn't want to put it down and I will be continuing on with the series. I really enjoyed the writing and I thought the cast of characters was very intriguing and really pulled you in to the story. The novel did lull in a couple of places, but that didn't impact my enjoyment of the book. I did listen to the audio book"
5079,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,3,"3.5 stars. Wondrously evocative and lyrical. Enthralling. Suspenseful. Redundant. Too redundant. This is a popular romantic fairy tale, found in the Young Adult and Juvenile shelves. Yet I question that classification, as there's a graphically adult scene (disturbing) as explained in spoiler further below. Major spoilers are tagged and hidden: Daughter of the Forest is an über-extended take on The Six Swans, set in medieval Ireland, when Druidic and Christian cultures first started to overlap. S"
5080,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"5 of 5 stars at The BiblioSanctum http://bibliosanctum.com/2015/01/30/b... In the second half of 2014, I read Juliet Marillier for the first time. The book was Dreamer’s Pool and as soon as I closed the cover on the last page, I asked myself the question most readers ask themselves right after they finish an amazing read: Why have I waited so long to read this author? And inevitably, the next thought is: I must read more! I know I say that a lot and I don’t always follow through, at least not righ"
5081,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"Amazing. If I wasn't sure before, this book solidifies Juliet Marillier as one of my very favourite authors. The story of Sorcha and her trials as she works to free her six brothers from enchantment is painful and gut wrenching. While it doesn't all result in a traditional fairy tale ending, the story does deliver what feels right and more true to our own experiences. No one can live through what Sorcha and her brothers do without being irrevocably changed. Marillier's writing is perfect as usual"
5082,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"As often happens, I feel rather inadequate when it comes to reviewing something so beautifully written and emotionally demanding. This is a retelling of a celtic myth, The Six Swans. A mix of folklore and fantasy, historical fiction and romance, Daughter of the Forest is the first of a trilogy (of 6 books, it seems). This book isn't fantasy in the way of most- it isn't filled with invented kingdoms or massive battles. It follows Sorcha, seventh daughter and only child of Lord Collum, as she suffe"
5083,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"I just want to say that I have very mixed feelings about this book. It is one of my favorite love stories of all time. It is not some mere trite story. It is meaningful and deep. However be warned, it does have what I have referred to before as ""content"". There is a part near the beginning where she is abused. Skip it. There is a part at the very end after they are married. There you go. So if you read it, and want to come away unscathed, be careful. Start at the part where Red finds her(maybe s"
5084,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,1,"I would not recommend it, especially to young adults. The story was beautifully woven and the writing is very engrossing, but there is graphic description of abuse that did not strengthen the book and was very unnecessary. It pretty much ruined the book for me."
5085,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,
5086,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"Such a gem to read and have on your bookshelf, full of magic and mysticism, love and romance. One the most beautifully crafted books I've read in a long time, the story line is very simple and has been written about in other reviews ,what makes it extra special is the voice of the narrator Sorcha (sor-ca), she tells her story with such a simple yet very emotive voice that can bring the reader to tears in just a few beautifully put together words. Altho this is a hefty book it didn't seem to matt"
5087,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"RE-READ: December 2017 5/5 stars “You will find the way, daughter of the forest. Through grief and pain, through many trials, through betrayal and loss, your feet will walk a straight path.” I cannot even begin to explain how much I love this book. It is definitely one of my all time favourite books, and may even take out that top spot. I remember absolutely adoring this book the first time I read it, but all the emotions have come rushing back to me this time. I am overwhelmed with how downri"
5088,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"I have three words to describe this book.... beautiful, heartbreaking and enchanting! Okay maybe four words if you count and... This book is something special and it has made its way to my ""favorite books ever"" shelf! If this is a book you're interested in then stop right now and read it. It's that good. Juliet Marillier is an amazing writer and this will be a book that I will never forget. She creates amazing imagery through her writing and you'll find yourself swept off to another land in n"
5089,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"I went from to this, to this, to this, There are books that you take little sips from then are those you devour… this a little bit of both. It’s intricately told with a cast of characters each as nuanced as the other that I couldn’t help but get drawn in. That it’s lengthy is of no issue, in fact, I loved that aspect of it. Particularly since it allowed the reveal of who was close to whom and which sibling had what role. But this is mainly about Sorcha though, youngest of the seven among whom"
5090,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,3,I am a great lover of fantasy but I am discovering that I prefer my fantasy books to be original and not based on fairy tales. (One notable exception being Cinder and its sequels). Fairy tales are known for their cruelty and hardship and Daughter of the Forest is quite relentless in this respect. It may be that the book was just a bit too long and Sorcha's tedious task seemed to take forever. However I was uncomfortable with several of the scenes and wished they had not occurred. I won't be cont
5091,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"What can I say, I saved the best for last.  Daughter of the Forest is my favorite fairy tale retelling of all time.  (So far.  Let me know your faves and try to prove me wrong!)  I did a mini-review of this once before, but I want to expand on that now, and get a little gushy fangirly. I read this for the first time after having just finished Wildwood Dancing (also by Marillier).  It came highly recommended by a friend, so I was pretty gung-ho.  But the first 30 pages almost made me put it down."
5092,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"If you are looking for a review that is more about the plot and characters, you'll have to look elsewhere. However, these are my thoughts on my experience of reading this book: This is now one of my favorite books. It was amazing. There are several reasons I loved this book but there is one that explains all the others - somehow I really identified with the protagonists even though on the surface I am nothing like her. However, I must have found something in her to identify with because I actuall"
5093,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,"It's been such a long time since one book has made me feel one strong emotion from another. From tears to rage This book will make you feel something wether you like it or not This was an beauitful book with sometimes some harsh underlining factors that made me cringe and at one time wanna rip out the pages, but as I read I couldn't help by be drawn even more deeply into the story. I won't lie and say I wasn't PO'd at the abuse Sorcha suffered but your showed she was stronger and was able to b"
5094,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"[5 Stars] I absolutely adored this book. It may be more of a 4.5 star book overall, but I think it may be a new favorite so I'm just giving it a 5 star rating because I loved it so! This book is haunting, beautiful, and it brought me to tears on more than one occasion. This was extremely different from other adult fantasy books I have been reading lately, and I think it was a really pleasant change. It felt in some ways like I was reading a Gail Carson Levine book for adults and about a billion"
5095,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"The time has come. I knew that at some point I would have to review Daughter of the Forest . Do you ever go through your book reviews and realize you haven't reviewed one of your favorite books of all time? And the reason is simply that you read it before reviewing was even a twinkle in your eye. You may have talked about it here, there, and everywhere. You may have heckled dear friends shamelessly until they broke down and read it. But you haven't actually reviewed it. And the other day I realiz"
5096,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,"A beautiful gripping story but very hard to read. This fairy tale for grown-ups tells the story of Sorcha, and her 6 elder brothers Finbar, Liam, Cormac, Conor, Padriac and Diarmid. Born and brought up on the Irish stronghold of Sevenwaters, the siblings grew strong and proud and had a bright future ahead. Up until the evil stepmother came! A wicked sorceress who wed their father, took over his will and stronghold and turned the 6 brothers to swans to have them out of her way. It was left to the"
5097,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"This was such a good start to a story. The writing's good, and I was pulled along, anxious to know what happens next. More thoughts later."
5098,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,"trigger warning for this book: Rape. (Which I didn't know going into this novel.) Daughter of the forest is a retelling of the fairy tale of the Six Swans by the Brothers Grimm. I've heard that story a couple of times when I was a child, and the way the author tells it in this book is amazing. I adored this book. I must admit that there were moments when I didn't connect with the story (the beginning was soooo slow) and I thought of DNF this book before I reach the 20% mark. I'm so glad I didn't."
5099,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,Sorcha is the Daughter of the Forest. Or at least she was until this book was published. Sadly they had to cut down the forest to print the book. It's....errr....cumbersome. But it's good.
5100,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,"3.75 Fairytale Stars Overall, I enjoyed this story and the remake of the old Fairytale. My heart broke time and time again especially for the brothers. But....(yeah, there is always a ""but"") I found this to be drawn out in parts and ended up skimming a lot of the book. Too much description and not enough action. I'm debating about reading the next book in the series especially since it's about my favorite brother."
5101,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,"I would like to preface this review by saying that I loved this book, and I will continue on with the rest of the series. This book consumed my life for a week. I couldn’t wait to get off work to read it. Juliet Marillier is a master at creating a folkloric, romantic atmosphere. But…But…oh god oh god the curse of modern feminism…But… [Warning: Minor Spoilers And Tasteless Jokes] Now there are a lot of handsome, male butts in this story, BUT the treatment of the main, female character, Sorcha, is a"
5103,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,"Daughter of the Forest is an absorbing, heart-breaking story. It's a retelling of the classic fairytale of the Wild Swans, and it doesn't gloss over the darker implications. Wallowing in the misery of them is more like it. In Ireland in the time of the Druids, Sorcha is a healer and a true child of the forest. Each of her six brothers is distinctly drawn, and the bonds of love and loyalty between them are firmly established - tangible, almost. As everything falls apart, their closeness makes the"

These characters will be in my heart forever, and this book has forever changed what books I choose to read. My only regret is that I chose this book when I had to actually DO things, like work and SLEEP. **I NEED TO RE READ SOON**"
5106,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"Lord Colum of Sevenwaters is blessed with six sons: Liam, a natural leader; Diarmid, with his passion for adventure; twins Cormack and Conor, each with a different calling; rebellious Finbar, grown old before his time by his gift of the Sight; and the young, compassionate Padriac. But it is Sorcha, the seventh child and only daughter, who alone is destined to defend her family and protect her land from the Britons and the clan known as Northwoods. For her father has been bewitched, and her broth"
5107,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,3,"I probably...maybe...would've enjoyed this more if I had read it myself. Alas, time constrictions dictated that I needed to listen to the audiobook and that, unfortunately, created a sense of disconnectedness from the events in the story. It also didn't help that this audiobook had the slowest narrator I've yet to come across so that even listening at 1.5 speed the story felt like it just went on and on and on. While I don't feel compelled to move on to the second book in this series (which appa"
5108,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,"I am a huge fan of fairy tales; however, I think that the ones I am drawn to the most tend to fit into two categories. I love the dark, realistic retellings with grey characters that are both villains and heroes and endings where nothing is truly resolved. I also love the black and white versions with clear cut uber villains and endings chock full o’ sweet sweet comeuppance. This book is somewhere in-between those two extremes. Although I really liked it, I found myself alternately wishing for m"
5109,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,3,"I'm leaning toward 4 stars overall but with lots and lots of reservations which I can't go into without hitting on spoilers. So beware of spoilers. This book was Beth 's pick for May and I just finished it today. In July. I'm not even sure where she is because we kind of let it drop after hitting a wall, but I think she's still pushing on. I'd like to say it was my fault, because I'm usually the one dropping out of buddy reads, but this time it's a combination of bad timing and a brutal rape scene"
5110,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,2,"*spoilers* no. seriously? we're going to throw a 14 year old in an already miserable situation and then, why not throw in gang rape? what? I can't possibly see how this can add to her story, just to make her more resilient, to add to her grief, what??? did you need us to be more sad for her??? because that sense of sympathy has already been developed, it's just unnecessary. I'm actually angry and don't think I'll be back to this author, which is a shame since I loved the first book I read from h"
5112,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,Where has this book been all my life?!
5114,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"Beautifully readable, well drawn characters, well woven plot. Loosely based on the old tale of the six brothers turned into swans by their evil step mother, Marillier enriches the tale with a likable heroine and six well defined brothers as well as other interesting people along the way. Lyrical descriptions of the enchanted forest with its magical creatures enrich the tale, beautifully woven to draw us in and surround us with this world. Straight forward without layers and hidden meanings, it is"

That is how I get when I have to give my opinion about this book. It is MY ALL TIME FAVORITE IN THE WORLD, IN THE UNIVERSE, AND BEYOND. I just...there are no words, honestly. I can only say 'thank you' over and over to the author for writing it, so thank you kind and lovely lady, I am, and will always"
5116,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,"This was an interesting mix of heroic journey (in this case heroine journey), fantasy, and romance. Who would have thought that a plot that requires the protagonist be unable to speak for much of the book, would still be able to draw in the reader? I will say that I did have to deduct points for the book being more descriptive of non-consensual sex than of consensual sex - why do some authors do that? However I did like that the book ended with not everyone and everything living happily ever aft"
5117,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"Trigger warning: sexual assault. Sorcha was supposed to have been born a boy. By all rights she should have been the seventh son of a seventh son, but fate had other plans. With six older brothers to play with her, teach her, and protect her, Sorcha grows up to be both strong-willed and knowledgeable in many arts typically forbidden to women of her rank. While she is close to all of her brothers, she is particularly connected to Finbar, who shares her mysterious gifts. The two siblings can commun"

When I was a child I loved fairy tales (well, to be honest, I still do) and one of my favourites was “The Six Swans”. So, it’s easy to imagine my excitement when I discovered Daughter of the Forest – a detailed retelling of that beautiful fable. Daughter of the Forest didn’t fail my expectations. The story was"
5119,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"This book is absolutely the gold standard in fairy tale reimaginings/retellings. It's based on ""The Six Swans,"" which is anyway one of my favorite tales, for its psychological complexity, suffering, and mysterious, almost baffling love story. Marillier's version captured me from the first page. It's detailed and passionate and emotionally convincing, and the writing is gorgeous without being overblown. I loved the world Marrillier creates. And what a heroine is Sorcha; what a hero is Red; and GO"
5120,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,I just have one thing to say - exquisite perfection! I read this book about 10 years ago and have always known it was one of my favorites. But re-reading this book shows me just how much I love this story. Marillier writes with such beauty and her characters are so full of life that you expect them to walk right out of the page and into your room. For anyone who loves a good fairytale retelling this is a must read.
5121,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,This book hits you hard with the feelings. I recommend reading it with wine. Or whisky.
5122,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"A more adult version of the well-known story of the 6 Swans, placed in a historical context, in the time of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, and in a different geographic area, in Ireland. The author follows the story as we know it, with her choices of time and place adding a more Celtic character with many pagan elements making their appearance while there are many references to the classic stories of Irish mythology. A further differentiation lies in the tone of text that is far from the classic way"

There is no dark or light save in your own vision. All changes in the blink of an eyelid; yet all remains the same.” This was a great story! Full of magic, love, sacrifice, action, adventure, pain but also courage and generosity! I loved the main character (Sorcha). When a story has such a dramatic charge, like this one I always get afraid that the main character may be to"
5124,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"I first read this incredible book in March of 2010. Before I had finished it I had ordered all the books in the Sevenwaters series. Before I finished the series I had purchased every book Juliet Marillier had written. She is a storyteller like no other. A friend of mine is reading Daughter of the Forest now, so I decided it was time to re-read it. I can not tell how much I enjoyed this re-read, and I felt I had to re-write my review. Daughter of the Forest takes place in about the 5th century in"
5125,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"I think it goes without saying that I read a lot of books. I like pretty much everything (because if I don’t like it, I usually abandon it), love a good deal, but every so often a book comes along that hits me in a way I know I will remember forever. It’s taken me nearly two months to compose my thoughts on Juliet Marillier’s Daughter of the Forest. Usually, this is a length of time in which I will give up reviewing a book altogether, it wasn’t meant to be, and that’s fine. But I can’t do that wi"
5126,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,"Daughter of the Forest by Juliet Marillier tells the story of Sorcha and her six older brothers. See, Sorcha should have been the seventh son of a seventh son – but she ended up being a girl instead. Fate is funny that way (turns out not so much ha-ha funny as cruelly ironic). What follows is the story of how Sorcha will do almost anything to keep her family together. To say that Juliet Marillier starts off Daughter of the Forest a little slow is like saying it might get slightly boring to watch"
5127,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,"I re-read this book this weekend (Jessica's fault). It was even better than I remembered. But ugh, THIS BOOK. This is a dark fairy tale re-telling, and I do mean dark . There is so much pain and suffering, too much , so much that it overwhelms you. It's devastating and hard to read and yet, you need to keep reading, no matter how much it is hurting you. But in the midst of all that pain is a love story too, delicately woven in with a fine thread. It's beautiful and captivating, but even that will h"
5128,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"Daughter of the Forest by Juliet Marillier is one of my all-time favourite books, that I like to re-read every few years. A retelling of the ‘Six Swans’ fairy-tale, set in ancient Ireland, it is a beautiful story of courage, love, peril and wonder set in a world where magic is only ever a hairsbreadth away from us all."
5129,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"I read this book to fill the Grimm Tale square of my 2018 Halloween Bingo card. To understand how much I love this novel, I must tell you how much I loved a Classics Illustrated version of The Wild Swans that I had as a child. It was one of the first things that I ever read all by myself and I read that comic book until it was tattered. This book is a retelling of that Hans Christian Andersen tale, which he probably heard as The Six Swans through the Brothers Grimm. This version sets the story bac"

Through grief and pain, through many trials, through betrayal and loss, your feet will walk a straight path."" Leí ""Daughter of the Forest"" por primera vez en 2014, y me rompió el corazón. Esta relectura no ha hecho más que asentarlo como uno de mis libros favoritos por derecho propio. Fantástico, mágico, lírico, desolador. Perfecto."
5132,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"Daughter of the Forest is quite a hard book to review because there's just so much to talk about. Sorcha is the seventh child, sister to six older brothers. They live in Sevenwaters, this beautiful magical place where we can see them growing up in happiness, peace and love. Juliet Marillier gives us a place that's very real but at the same time fulfilled with folklore, magical creatures with weird agendas of their own, a spiritual world that exists all around. It's done so brilliantly that you ne"
5133,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,"In three words: enchanting, lyrical, moving. ""'Do not judge too quickly that which you cannot understand.'"" Some books are slow, and some books are really slow. Daughter of the Forest definitely falls into the latter category, to the point where, if I hadn't been enjoying the story immensely, I would have described it as painfully slow. But actually the slow style was beautifully done - although it did take me a few chapters to get completely absorbed, it meant that we learned a lot about the pro"
5134,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,"This was the first fantasy book I ever read so there was a fair amount of nostalgic enjoyment I got out of the re-reading, or in this case, listening. I have to admit that I never read all the books in this series and this is something I want to rectify this year. The framework of this first instalment is a little bit like a reimagined Grimm Fairy-tale. We have a wicked stepmother who casts a spell with only one person that can break this spell but it will take courage, tears and sacrifice. The"

This review probably won't be too long, since I don't have much to criticize. Well, this is the second book by Juliet Marillier that I've read. The first was Wildwood Dancing , which I really enjoyed. However, I was hesitant to try this series because it sounded a little too ""epic fantasy"" for my taste. Usually I don't really enjoy this type of thing, but I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It had very good"

It was given to me by my mother in hopes to keep me occupied, and it worked. It is an enchanting tale that pulls the reader in. It takes the story of the swan brothers and their savior sister to a new level. Intertwining with historic cultures it makes a fairy tale real again. You can't help but be captured by the world that it creates. It is one of those books that you can"
5137,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,"4.5* It is marvelously written! It reminded me that I used to love reading Mists of Avalon so much and I should re-read them again one day. The first 100-150 pages are somewhat slow but at one point it is hard to leave the book, I just wanted to keep on reading it. And although it has a little bit of too much romance for me, I loved the tales and the magic and the nature in it and I am looking forward to keep reading the books!"
5138,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,"Currently rereading. Thoughts from 2010: This book is different of any other book I've ever read. The mythology was very refreshing and interesting, although the part where Sorcha is torturing herself by making the shirts could have been less extensive. Still, Red is a great character and I fell in love with him immediatly. I will read the other Sevenwaters books very soon."
5139,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,2,"While the prose is very good and the world easy to get immersed into, neither the storyline nor the characters are that good as Marillier's remarkable storytelling talent would usually lead one to expect. The retelling hasn't worked for me, but I still like this author."
5140,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,3,"3.7 stars TRIGGER WARNING: RAPE I thought long and hard about how I should rate this. I was conflicted on whether giving it 4 stars or something a little less. For a good part it was a 4 star read but for me the ending was so underwhelming and it wrapped up pretty hastily that I just couldn't bring myself to give it 4. I couldn't sorry. Having said that, I cannot deny that I liked very very much this fairytale. Because that's exactly what it was; dark and twisted but still a fairytale. I loved tha"

When her father remarries, her new step mother casts a spell on the brothers and only Sorcha can break the curse. Only a young girl, Sorcha must complete a difficult task with strict rules all while falling prey to various elements: weather, marauders and even some Britons who are looking for a young man that Sorcha's father had kidnapped and tortured. This is billed as fantasy, but I think it would appe"
5145,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,3,"3.5/5 I should have been the seventh son of a seventh son, but the goddess was playing tricks, and I was a girl. Juliet Marillier's Daughter of the Forest is a beautifully written novel that almost made me fall in love with it despite veering towards self-indulgence. Yes, the writing is beautiful, but it doesn't change the fact the book is too long for what it is (a retelling of The Six Swans ) and where it leaves me at the end of it as a reader. I did more than appreciate the novel reinforcing tha"
5146,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"To say that I enjoyed this book would be a gross understatement. I was absolutely amazed with it! The story used to be one of my favorite fairytales as a kid and I'm glad that this version stayed so close to it and also managed to expand so well outside the original tale. Sorcha is an amazing heroine and the hero... well he's awesome. Knowing the fairytale I knew how this would end, and yet I was actually anxious while reading the last pages wondering if she'd make the shirts on time:) I will ad"
5148,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"I agree with all the reviews - it is a beautifully written story, the style that is well suit for the Irish magical tales. A warm, real, romantic and gut-wrenching tale that engrossed me from start to finish, and stayed with me after the story was long over. I cried at this quote: ""It matters not if you were here or there, for I see you before me every moment. I see you in the light on the water, in the swaying of the young trees in the Spring wind. I see you in the shadow of the grey oaks. I he"

It had such an amazing atmosphere, the characters were just awesome, and the writing, guys the writing was amazing. I so did not expect to love this book so much, I mean I knew I was going to like it a lot, but it blew me away. I will say I listened to the audio book for most of the story and again, as audio books are often doing for me, made the story for me. The plot is very slow moving and the writing is long wind"
5150,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"I wish I could give this a million stars. Truly a masterpiece. You know when a piece of writing has such focus, such power, that you're holding your breath waiting for it all to fall apart and for the work just to become something normal? This never did. It never fell apart. Every thread was perfect in its weaving. This book is like an early summer day with no humidity, a good night's sleep with sweet dreams only, a perfect ride on a horse you trust with perfect weather and perfect ground. <3"
5152,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,"Wow, this was so good. I wished I’d known about this series sooner! Thank you Juliette Cross for the recommendation 😊 I can’t wait to jump into book two."
5153,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,3,"Classic fantasy meet Celtic folklore, a very nice retelling of Andersen’s wild swan fairytale. I liked the Ireland setting and Marillier’s evocative and poetic writing but due to episodes of violence (view spoiler) [(one of rape) (hide spoiler) ] , not recommended for a younger audience."
5154,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,"4 1/2 stars. Oh so close to greatness. Imagine a Disney princess movie that is rated a hard R and you will have some idea of what Daughter of the Forest is like. All of the traditional tropes are here: the evil step mother, the innocent and wholesome princess, the fairy godmother, the dashing prince charming, and a curse that our heroine must break to save her family. Sprinkle in some torture and gang rape and never look at Snow White the same way again. This book is really fantastic, and the onl"
5155,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,3,"I judge books by their cover, I admit it, so in all honesty I would have never picked up this book on it's own. It looks too science fictiony/fantasy for me, and I can never get into those books. Also, the way the girl is on the cover kinda reminded me of (which I still need to finish - I will Chachic !). At any rate, I saw that most of my Goodreads friends had read it and they all seemed to enjoy it... which is surprising because usually we're all across the board. Atnywho, I picked it up and s"
5156,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,"I'm always surprised when an author can take a story that, in its original, was probably a couple of pages long, retell it in 500 pages or more, and still make it coherent and interesting. Daughter of the Forest takes the fairy tale ""The Six Swans"" and does just that. Daughter of the Forest is a combination of fairy tale, historical fantasy, and romance. Its world creates itself, immerses the reader, not so much by beauty of prose, but by an accumulation of scene and detail. Readers of big fat f"

Book blogger and Goodreads friends have told me that this novel is one of their favorites and because it's a retelling of the fairy tale The Six Swans , makes it more than interesting for me.

5158,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,"Buddy read with Vippi :3 4.5 Lys: ""When will you read Marillier's Daughter of the forest?"" Well, I've read it now. U.U I'm always doubtful when I read fairytale retellings, because, I think, it's one of the most difficult genres to write. A retelling is always going to be compared to its original inspiration and it also has to be quite unique because no one wants to read a simple re-writing of the original tale. Marillier has done a marvelous job doing this: Daughter of the forest is fairytale like,"
5159,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"It wasn't like this in the stories. In the old tales, when a young man went forth to have adventures, he endured his trials and came forth triumphant. He became a leader, or acquired a magical skill, or at the very least wed a princess. Maybe all three. There was never any question, not even in the darkest moment, that the hero would conquer both his enemies and his self-doubt. This book is beautiful and lyrically magical in a way that The Lord of the Rings reads to me. Make no mistake, it's a sl"
5160,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"I absolutely adored this book. It was beautiful, heartbreaking and magical all at the same time. I am so glad I finally picked it up, I can see Marillier becoming one of my favourite authors. So the first thing I was say about this book is that it is really dense, it is only 16 chapters despite it being around 650 pages which took me a while to get used to. The story is quite a slow-burn but I was soon completely hooked and immersed in the word. It is set in 10th century Ireland, and is full of C"
5161,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"Yeah no, my rating has not changed. Hell I'd give it more stars if possible. This is the book that a decade and more ago showed me how a book is different from a novel. Marillier built not only a novel that stands well on its own but planted the seeds of a family saga which only recently concluded. Sorcha is the kind of character who, if you were to write her traits as plain facts on paper, sounds like a Mary Sue. She is strong willed and well versed in the exact right skills to help her on her j"

5165,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,"Once more I'm breaking my review moratorium. In this case it's because this book is exceptional. This is a historical fiction/fantasy grounded in Celtic & Welsh mythology, set primarily in Ireland but building on a tale from the Mabinogion. It has far less fantasy than ""A Song of Ice & Fire,"" yet the fantastic is integral to its plot in a way that it is not in Martin's writing. The Fair Folk are the gods of the Celts, the Druids are Irish, and Christianity exists but isn't period-accurate"
5166,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,2,"2.5 stars The only thing that kept me going was the five star ratings that plague this book - I thought that the ending MUST be great to warrant such thoughts. Alas, I couldn't enjoy the story at all, despite coming in with a super positive and expectant attitude. Although you can definitely see the detail in which the author puts in characterization and the great relationship between Sorcha and her brothers, there's no arguing the fact that the book is so damn slow that I couldn't enjoy it.

I've had this book recommended to me since high school but only just got to reading it (I'm 29 right now.) It starts slow, and for the first 5 chapters or so, I struggled to get to the action. But once Sorcha's childhood is over and her father marries her ""wicked stepmother,"" I couldn't put the book down. The writing is lyrical, vivid, emotionally moving (I mean, how many chills can you get in 1 book??), and balances"
5169,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"This is a super dense book. It took me a while to get through it, even though in page count it isn't as long as some books. The pacing is steady (but slow) and builds to a really incredible and bittersweet ending. I cried like a baby through the last quarter of the book or so. It's been a long time since I've read a fantasy book that is as nuanced and heartbreaking and hopeful as this one. I really like the earthy magic and emphasis on fables and fairy tales.

I'd been so looking forward to this. After reading my very first Marillier book, Shadowfell , last year and absolutely loving it to pieces, I decided to go right back to the beginning with this, her début novel, Daughter of the Forest.

The Six Swans fairytale wasn't one of my favorite fairy tales as a child, so I've not read many retellings of it (partially because it is not as popular as other fairy tales). But I would say this is one of the better (if not one of the best) retellings of the tale out there. The world of Ms. Marillier is alive and beautiful and brutal. Sorcha, the protagonist of the story, struggles to overcome a curse placed upon her brothers. The conditions: she must sew six shirts from t"

Even almost a day after I've finished it and I can't stop myself from reliving my favorite scenes in my head. I think that one of the things that makes this book so successful is the characters. This is truly a story where you could say there are 9 main characters, it's a story that truly relies on the relationship between these characters, and this is where it truly shines. Every single character is well defined"
5175,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"How is it that the entire world falls away when you've got a Marillier book in your hands? Her stories are always about magic in some form or another, but the experience of reading her books and how it takes hold of you is where the real magic lies. I picked it up in the daylight and when I looked up from it, the sky was dark and everyone was asleep. Not a lot of the books I've loved aged as well as I did (hahaha what is this thing you call modesty and how can it possibly improve upon that which"

After my last stopping point, themes of this book have been appearing in my dreams, so last night I decided to read more, maybe a chapter or two (or three), but once I started I could not stop. While not a perfect novel, it really did everything that I was looking for at the moment. A strong but not perfect heroine. A great plot. Ireland.

5181,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"I read this book when I was twelve or thirteen, and perhaps a little too young to understand concepts like the war between the Irish and the Britons, love and romance, and rape. Nonetheless, it was one of the books that marked my love of reading and one of the few I even dared to give a 5 star rating. I must confess I loved the ""Sevenwaters"" saga, and I thought I would become a fan of Marillier and discover a new genre of literature to enjoy, but none of the other celtic books have captivated me"
5182,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"How do you know you've read a fantastic book? You are absolutely desperate for the story to continue and you want to run out and buy every book the author has ever written. For me this was one of those books, there was something about Sorcha's story that touched my very soul. As though her story some how connected to my own and it left me wanting so much more. Daughter of the Forest is about a young girl who is a healer by nature, she has grown up with the love and fierce protection of her six br"
5184,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"This book has held a place in my heart since I first read it over 10 years ago. It had been a long time since I last read it, and I was almost scared to reread it now. I was worried that perhaps it wasn't as amazing as I'd remembered. And I would be so sad if it lost its place on my list of all time favorites. So I was very pleased to discover that it is just as incredible as I remembered. This book. I can't say enough good things about it. It is a tragic tale of loss and heartbreak, a story of d"

I see you in the light of the water, in the swaying of the young trees in the spring wind. I see you in the shadows of the great oaks, I hear your voice in the cry of the owl at night.

5186,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"WOW. I haven't had a book yet this summer that I just couldn't put down. The basic premise is that a young girl, Sorcha, has to break her family free from a curse put on them by a sorceress. Sorcha was a wonderful main character to follow. She was full of courage, determination, and hope. This book had everything I love in it...celtic lore, a slow building romance, action, magic, druids, friendship, fairies! If you are looking for a great fantasy book to read, I highly recommend! Off to the libr"
5188,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"4 1/2 stars. I really like Juliet Marillier's style. She doesn't just tell a story, she weaves a tale. This tale was about Sorcha and her journey to complete a painful task to save her brothers. It was a hard, journey with lots of struggles, but Sorcha is so determined and selfless. I struggle to say that I loved this book, because how can I love a book in which someone struggles so much, but it was a great book. I really loved Sorcha. (view spoiler) [ and I really loved Red and their romance (hi"
5189,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"I didn't even plan on reading this book because it was due at the library the next day, but then I opened it because why not? and I fell in love within the first two pages. There are some passages that made my heart ache, they were so beautifully written, and the characters are so vividly drawn. This is the kind of fairy tale that I feel like I've known my whole life, that I haven't read in ages. It's been a while since I found a retelling this detailed and good , though. Isn't it weird to feel n"
5190,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,3,"Daughters of Sevenwaters Sevenwaters Couples A bit boring on some parts, a bit interesting on others parts, but I could not bond with the characters as much as I wanted! It wasn't a terrible book but I read better books, regardless I will still try to read the second book in the series ."
5191,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"I don't know how I hadn't come across this book before now! WOW!! Beautiful!! Absolutely beautiful!! What a fantastic version of the fairy tale. Beautiful characters, I loved them all, even the awful ones!!! LOVED IT!!! 5 stars! I am sure this is a book I will be re-reading many times in the future."
5193,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,2,"I don't see myself ever finishing this. I know the original from H.C. Andersen and it wasn't one of my favorites of his anyway. Don't know what made me pick this up - oh, the fantastic ratings of course. But all that glimmers ain't gold."
5194,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"Set in ancient Ireland, this tale is steeped in legend and tales of the fae folk. I was held under its spell, not wanting it to end."

5197,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,Oh my God. Where has this book been all this time! I can't stop thinking about it. Definitely one of my favourite book of the year!
5199,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"**4.5** I absolutely adore Marillier's writing, it's flowery and beautiful without being over the top. I will say the story is a little slow in the beginning but if you read adult fantasy then it probably won't be an issue! I can't wait to start the next book!"
5201,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,WOW. This is one of the best books I've ever read.
5202,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"The one thing I kept wondering once I finished this book was why have I never heard about this book before. Fantastic and amazing are words that come to mind to describe The Daughter of the Forest. I could not put this down for a minute - stayed up till 5.30 reading this on a workday, and amidst a lot of yawing the next day I couldn't get this book out of my mind. Still can't. Daughter of the Forest has its basis on ancient Celtic legend where the Fair Folk walked the lands of the forest along wi"
5203,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,"Sunlight and Rainbows are not a part of this fairytale retelling, then again most retellings are like that but this one was a little bit more darker. I am not saying that I did not enjoy the book on the contrary I loved the book. It was engaging and had the correct twist and turns at the all the correct points ( a few extraordinary twists I might add which I thought I would never encounter in a fairy tale retelling). May be that is the point of the whole endeavour, to expect the unexpected in an"
5204,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"This is a book that was truly written to be savored. The pace in the beginning is leisurely, as the narrator - Sorcha - sets up the nature of life in this version of Ireland, of the enchantment of her village and home and their relationship with the 'fair folk'. Truthfully there were times that I felt the book to be too slow, but that impatience quickly disappeared as I became used to the the author's way of unfolding the story. And Sorcha has a way of dropping foreboding hints of what is to com"

My booktuber friend Tanya suggested it as one of the selections for my Booktuber Recommended Reads project for 2015 (one personally selected book a month from twelve amazing vloggers). I also got to buddy read it with Lila (from the Lila Wood channel). In addition to these incentives, my husband and I rented a log cabin in Hocking Hills, OH for two nights. Scenic windows overlooked a forest and ridge filled with many car"
5206,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"I've read Ms. Marillier before ( The Dark Mirror , Blade of Fortriu ) which I greatly enjoyed but haven't been able to read the conclusion just yet...maybe this year. I've had Daughter of the Forest and the rest of the series on my TBR for a very long time and have been putting it off though I'm not sure why. I need it for a challenge that ends May 15th so I finally forced myself to sit down and read it. And boy oh boy did it wreck me. The trials and tribulations of poor Sorcha were just heart-break"
5207,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,"I'm not sure how I feel about this book. So much about it I really liked, so much about it really disappointed me. Bear with me while I try to put my thoughts into some sort of understandable review. Juliet Marillier is an amazing bard. She's not just an author, she's a bard of the old-fashioned sense of the word. I wasn't just reading a book, I was listening to an old legend brought to life. Her words were magical, and you're transported. My complaints about this book have absolutely nothing to"
5208,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"All words fail me when trying to describe how AMAZING Daughter of the Forest is. I found myself drawn deep into a fantasy world, filled with unyeilding love, promise, torment, and devotion like no other. The trials that Sorcha and her six brothers withstand are unbelievable. The people Sorcha comes into contact with on her journey and how deeply she affects their lives are breathtaking. I've never read anything like Daughter of the Forest and cannot wait to get lost in this beautiful world again"
5209,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,"I really liked the main character Sorcha and the strength of character that she had. She had a wonderful relationship with her brothers, which often made me think of my three older brothers. She took on the most impossible task in order to save her brothers lives, at great sacrifice to herself. The love story between her and Hugh was sweet. I liked how he took it upon himself to be her protector, how they had a connection and even though she couldn’t speak they were able to communicate and build"

But for my own sanity's sake I have to vent. The good: Well, despite a few editing mistakes the writing was good...yeah, and that's about it for the good. The bad: I could go on for a really long time on this one but I'll just tell you a few things. I hate books where it's obvious the author has had some twisted life that makes them a cold, bitter, hate pushing, freak, who litter their"
5211,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,2,"Daughter of the Forest is a retelling of an Irish fairy tale, where the sons of a powerful landholder are turned into swans. The only surviving child, the daughter of course, must complete the task of creating a garment for each brother under a vow of silence before they can become men again. But instead of adding a new twist to the story, it just stretches out the inevitable as much as possible. It was as if the author took the original story, created a first person narrative and then added des"
5212,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,"This is the second time Juliet Marillier has kept me up past dawn finishing a book of hers. I don't know what it is about her books that make them so captivating. Marillier always seems to start off so slowly that I'm not sold immediately on the story, but by midpoint it's like somehow my fingers/eyes are glued to the book and I can't for the life of myself get myself to stop reading. I think it's because everything is so vivid it's like I'm actually there, in the story, and I have to see it to"

I'm so happy I decided to re-read this series, and finish it this time around. I remember loving the second book even more, so I'm hoping to pick that up from the library soon. I need to buy my own copy of this book some day, because I just adore it. I have never done this before, but I thought I'd give a trigger warning here. If you want to read this book, I'll say this: TW for rape"
5215,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"Actual rating: 4.5 stars Oh my this book... the feels, just fantastic! I felt sad, enraged, sad again, more rage and heartbroken for the things Sorcha couldn't say. I love Red, and at the risk of sounding like a silly romantic, Red's declaration of love maybe one of the best I've ever read. I awwwed out loud when I read it and it didn't help that I was in the doctor's office at the time. Look, I even copy pasted it: ""You are the blood in my veins, and the beating of my heart. You are my first waki"
5217,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,3,"I really wanted to like this book more than I actually did. It had all of the right elements. A strong girl, magic, adventure, a destiny to fulfill and romance. However the book was just too long. The text was dense and cumbersome. At points I had to force myself to get through it. This novel had such high ratings but for me it fell flat. Plus there was so much left at the end unresolved. I still gave this a 3 because it is a good story but it could have been so much better."
5218,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"This was my first book by Juliet Marillier and wow what an experience. The Audio version Narrated By Terry Donnelly was so filled with raw emotion it brought me to tears many times. A beautiful retelling of The Six Swans, by the Brothers Grimm."
5219,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,"This kinda reminded me of Outlander a lot of the time? It's very wordy + atmospheric; a mix of historical fiction and fantasy elements, but sans time travel and the characters in Daughter of the Forest are better."
5220,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,"it took me a literal month to read this one but I finally, finally finished it!! It was the kind of story that made me nostalgic for things that aren't even real, if that makes sense. I absolutely loved it."
5221,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"I FREAKING LOVE THIS BOOK. 'nuff said. 'The only good Briton is a dead one.' AHAHAHAAHA No matter how many times I read this book, I just can't get enough. Forget Disney characters, the Sevenwaters are my men! I'll take Hugh over Eric anydayy ;D"
5222,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,Ahhhh this book never fails to satisfy. And I think it's kicked me out of my slump! (If only to get me to want to read the entire rest of the series very badly)
5223,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"Imaginative, Captivating & Heartfelt!"
5224,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,This book is beautiful. I actually audibly sighed when I finished it. The imagery...
5225,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,I'm dead. I don't know how to go on after this book. Maybe I'll just read it again.
5226,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"So. You know when you really really adore a book and you are practically squealing with delight when you get to the finish line and your heart is pounding and you just are SO EXCITED AND NOBODY YOU KNOW HAS EVER READ THIS ONE PARTICULAR BOOK AND YOU HAVE TO BE ALL LONELY WITH YOUR FEELINGS? That's how I feel right about now. I mean , on the surface this a pretty straight and narrow retelling of The Six Swans. Trying to explain it to someone would make it seem endlessly dull. Girl saves brothers"
5227,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,2,"""There is no good or evil, save in the way you see the world. There is no dark or light, save in your own vision."" Rating: 2.5 stars Juliet Marillier tells a story of a reserved and protected girl, forced out of her element in search of answers, but finding only a curse and bad luck. I’m not particularly impressed with this book---it is an average, yet interesting fantasy for me. Although the author’s writing style is filled with scenic imagery, the story gets bogged down in too much description"
5228,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,"Reading this book felt like I was undertaking Sorcha's task along with her. It was so long and so upsetting and many times I wanted to give up, because even though I wanted to know what happened I knew it would be hundreds of pages until I got there. It was only at about page 350 that I really couldn't stop reading, which is probably the longest it's ever taken me to get into a book. I'll admit I was bored for at least the first 100 pages. Still, this book is so beautifully written. The prose is"

Daughter of the Forest is a beautiful painful fairytale retelling about the lengths that one young girl will take to save her brothers. Although I did not know the story of the six swans before I began it, it has since become one of my favorites. This is the path. Straight ahead, Sorcha. You knew it would be hard. It will become harder still. Sorcha lives with her father Lord Colum and her 6 older brothers in a place cal"
5230,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"Once again, Juliet Marillier makes me wish I could live in one of her books. I don't even know where to start with this one, it literally couldn't cater to my tastes more than it already does: an ancient Celtic setting, Faery folk, magic, well-written romance, believable characters, and of course, the lovely lyrical prose that Mrs. Marillier is known for. I felt a deep connection with this book in more ways than one while reading it; from the atmospheric and mystic Irish forests to the main charac"
5231,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,"This is a retelling of the Irish myth The Children of Lir. I love the way it is written. It is slow-moving, gentle and magical. The forest setting manages to entwine its way throughout the story. Nature and animals play a huge role in the tale. I considered a 5 star rating on this one but the thing that made me settle on 4 was the age of the protagonist. It might be faithful to the original, but I have difficultly with the idea of a 12 year old child being that self contained, knowledgable and re"
5232,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,"What a beautiful, lush fairy tale/historical fantasy based on the Celtic fairy tale ""The Children of Llyr."" I'll provide a longer review later at epicfantasyfanatics.com. For now, suffice it to say that this should have been a five star book. Why four stars? An extremely graphic and gratuitous (as in, unnecessary for the character's development) rape scene. Just shock value. Almost ruined the whole book for me."
5233,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,3,"The setting felt very magical and fairy-tale like, being a blend of Irish, English and German folklore, but do not go into this book expecting fluff. The obstacles Sorcha faces are the stuff of hurt fanfiction (I'm not being sarcastic, I like fanfction). The way that her brothers treat her, like she's their responsibility, but not their equal even after she saves them, really shows how even the most important men in a woman's life will fail to save her or give comfort when needed. For that reaso"

One of my really good friends can attest to the fact that it has been a long time in coming for me to finally read Daughter of the Forest by Juliet Marillier. It was on her recommendation that I add this novel to my large pile of books to read quite some time ago and there it sat for much too long in hindsight. This isn't going to be one of my more wordy reviews, because there is just too much to comment on, and"

5237,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"This fairytale retelling is beautifully woven into a 10th century Celtic setting where the land and people are rich with folklore. A tale of redemption, struggle and healing that shows life is never easy but happiness can be found in family and those who see us for our true selves. Best of all, the tale finishes in a way to leave you content but also wanting and asking for more."
5238,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,2,"After hundreds of pages of rape hanging over the story like a ghoulish specter, the main character finds randy, honeymoon bliss in the last few pages of the book. Her man is well hung, we are assured, but he's gentle and loving and eager for smooches. Marillier's writing could indeed be good, as many fans have raved about. Certain passages had a beauty and poetry to them. And she told Sorcha's tale very well despite Sorcha being unable to speak. However, the story overall was flawed for two reas"
5241,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"The story is set in Britain and Ireland before the time of Christianity. The framework for Daughter of The Forest is a Germanic tale, The Six Swans, a wonderful story from the collection of the Grimm Brothers. Daughter of the Forest is a beautiful and tearful tale, and I find myself crying in many parts of the story. Sorcha (pronounced: Sor-ra) is the youngest child and the only daughter of Lord Colum of Sevenwaters. After her mother’s death, Sorcha and her six elder brothers live freely. Quiet a"

A true journey to a fantasy land where myths and legends, brave heroines and strong heroes are real! “Daughter of the Forest” by Juliet Marillier is a fairy tale and something more at the same time! I couldn’t believe that this version of a classic fairy tale would be so wonderful! The book has it all: an evil step-mother, a magic forest, magic numbers (the seventh child of the seven child etc), some very difficult tasks, a very brave young woman and a handsome and strong ma"

I liked the atmosphere, Marillier's style of writing and the way she built the world, but the storyline lacked and perhaps a third of the way through, it started to become a chore to read.

5248,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,No review I do could ever do this book true justice. The writing is beautiful and so too is the story. I had not known about the swans myth prior to reading this and so I came into it not knowing what to expect aside from what the summary states. But what I found I quickly fell in love with. Marillier interweaves fantasy and historical fiction so well that I almost expect to see Fair Folk in Celtic history books. I was fully enthralled throughout the tale and I barely wanted to put the book down

Among the hundreds of extraordinary—and, admittedly, some not-so-extraordinary—tales, however, the one about the girl who must endure great travails to free her six older brothers who have been turned into swans has always been one of my favorites, because it’s just so emotional, and the girl is so admirable. Happily, Juliet Marillier keeps m"
5250,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"Have you ever seen a book and automatically knew from the synopsis that you would love it? Daughter of the Forest was that book for me. This book is one of the most richly detailed, beautifully written fantasy books that I've ever read. It took me a little bit to get into and I almost gave up, but I'm so glad that I didn't. I loved the story. I loved the closeness and protectiveness of Sorcha's seven brothers. I loved the journey she went on (and oh did I FEEL for the girl, my goodness. She is s"
5252,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,"I'll start by saying, that I read this book without knowing it was a retelling of an ancient Celtic fairytale called-The Six Swans. Since I'm not familiar with this tale, it was all new to me. I did like this story very much, although as with some other reviewers, it did take me a long time to read it. The book has beautiful descriptions, but at times I found myself not needing that much detail. My mind would wander off....wondering where the story was going, and rather hoping it would get on wi"

Marillier's debut novel Daughter of the Forest is an exquisite tale of love, loyalty, and sacrifice that sweeps readers into medieval Ireland. Young Sorcha of Sevenwaters is the only one who can break the curse placed on her six older brothers by her father's new sorceress wife. Her task? To weave shirts for each of her brothers from the fibers of"
5256,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,Three chapters in. When I picked up this book all the reviews seemed to focus on its being based on a fairy tale. Currently I'm just really enjoying the setting and the characters and have almost completely forgotten this fairy tale basis. Having finished the book Things I liked: The setting: psudo-historical setting made me happy and sad thinking of a magical past world that is now gone (and in the context of the story must inevitably come to an end). The first person perspective: I liked the
5257,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"I have mixed feelings regarding the Daughter of the Forest. For once it was tormenting and heart wrenching to read, full of suffering and disbelief at the amount of pain the main character and her brothers had to go trough. It was almost to much to bear for me, torn between the want to toss the book in a corner and the need to go on reading. It was not all about suffering though. It was about magic and fairies (the good and the bad kind), a wild old land and ancient traditions, it was about fate"
5258,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,3,"I have mixed feelings about this book. On one hand, The Six Swans is one of my favorite tales ever. On the other hand... I didn't really enjoy this book. Yes, it was nicely written. The characters, the descriptions... everything was ok. But it simply didn't click for me. Also, the fact that it was an exact retelling made it... boring? The story was embellished and given more details, but in essence everything was the same. I kept thinking of Cinder 's retelling of Cinderella and how I felt so hap"
5259,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"I simply cannot put this book down because of its exquisite, sensational writing and engrossing storytelling. Sorcha's story is a dark magical fairytale where her personal strength plays an essential role in her journey to save her family. This story is one of triumph of the human spirit, faith and belief, and most of all, love. Written in first person narration, it is both raw and heartfelt. Recommended if you like strong female characters that challenges the patriarchal society, fairytale rete"

Though at first, the story moved a little slowly, it gradually picked up the pace and had me hooked throughout the entire novel.

The reader can really see the development of each characters' personalities from the beginning of the novel to the end. Readin"

Even though she couldn't talk through most of the book it still kept me on the edge of my seat and I wanted to keep reading . At times during the book when she couldn't speak up for herself I wanted to jump up and slap whoever it was being cruel to her in the face (Richard, Reds uncle mainly) . This book is one of my alltime favorites , it's amazing ! This and the next one Son of the Shadows are"
5262,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"I'm completely in awe of this novel. I can't remember the last time I was so enthralled. There were times while reading that I was spoken to and didn't want to speak I was so captivated, and fearful that I'd somehow cause Sorcha to speak and fail at saving her brothers. I thought about this book even when I was away from it, while eating dinner with my boyfriend, or taking a shower. I want more from this world, and I feel so lucky that there are in fact more books in the series. This is now hand"

5265,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"A painful and bittersweet and all around amazing story. Intense and magical, the story of the Sevenwater siblings is one of great pains and greater love, sacrifices and rewards. I read the whole book in one sitting (and it's not a small one) forgoing sleep and I don't regret it one bit. I will definitely read more from the author, although probably not right away, since this may have been enjoyable but it was also exhausting!"
5266,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,"5 stars for this book. I really didn't quite know what to expect when I started reading this book. I thought it might be silly and far-fetched and I didn't know if I would like it. But you know what, it was really good. The authors writing was wonderful, almost poetic at times and her ability to tell this story was fantastic. It's one of those books that you just have to let go and open your mind to the story. I enjoyed the myth and magic of this Celtic retelling of the Swans."
5267,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,"I really liked this one. I didn't give it 5 stars because at times, it was a bit too wordy for me. But then, I often have the attention span of a goldfish. I am more tuned into ""love"" stories with a bit more, um, ""activity"". Ahem. However, this tale kept me captivated and I just spent the last 3 hours huddled in a blanket on my deck on a most beautiful fall day finishing it."
5268,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,1,"The first series that showed it was possible to do an uninspired rewrite of Tolkien and make a mint was Shannara. After that the doors were flung wide, and the next to profit off the scheme was was Robert Jordan. Of course, I'm not suggesting it's bad to take inspiration from older authors--all authors do this, as Virgil did from Homer, and Milton from Virgil, and Byron from Milton. Tolkien himself drew on the Norse Eddas, Welsh myths, English fairy tales, and Blake's myth-making. But when a skil"

5272,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,"Robert Jordan copied Tolkien but, I just don’t care. What I mean is that his writing shouldn’t be judged on this single fact. Yes, Jordan has borrowed aspects of Tolkien’s middle earth; yes, he has blatantly reworked many aspects, but he has also infused it with a few of his own original ideas. The result is a fantasy universe that resembles Tolkien’s and, in some ways, transcends it. Not completely original, but completely brilliant I found that Jordan’s world wasn’t as obvious as Tolkien’s. I"

Simply put: I hate this book. Somewhat passionately. The Romgi will attest to the fact that while I was reading I would mutter to myself about how ridiculous the plot was or how much I hated dragging myself through all 800+ pages. But I carried on. The main character, Rand, was so uninteresting that I honestly didn’t care what happened to him, nor do I"

This is such a huge series and reading people grouch about 8-10 is not a good sign since reading 7 tomes is huge task. But then one can’t know until they try. Right?

Obviously that didn't end well. My initial rating was 3 stars than 2 after editing and now 1 since that is what DNF-ed books get. There is interesting worldbuilding here and potentially good heroic tale but I just can't look past so many annoying characters and this time around was even worse because I knew they become even more annoying.

I think I might even have enjoyed this 2016 reread of Eye of the World more than I enjoyed my original read.

The only similarities I see are 1) they are in the fantasy genre, and 2) they are among the best in their genre. The writing quality is excellent. Many characters are extensively developed. The world building is very detailed. The magic system is average, but at least the male/female separation of power sources is something different. My only problem is wit"

Rating might change after more thought, but I was really pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this. I didn't go into the book expecting to hate it or anything, but there are always these feelings of wariness whenever I dip my toes into 'classic fantasy' and 'classic scifi.'

5328,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,2,"So I’ve finally finished this book. Some of you may remember that I DNF’d it earlier in the month as it was boring me to tears. Well I took a break and picked it back up again, determined to finish it this time. And that I did folks. It was a slog, but I did it. I don’t think it’s ever taken me so long to read a book, even one of this size. I have very mixed feelings on it overall. I think it was far too long for all the story it held. Things don’t really get going until we are 300 odd pages in."

Feist (about 30 books) I was in desperate need of another Epic Fantasy series, that didn't have any complex politics and war tactics, just a couple of normal boys traveling the world, finding out they are ment for greatness and eventually saving everyone. Pretty simple, right? For me, this kind of plot is hard t"

And for good reason - his first few books in the ""wheel of time"" series are very well written. He has a lot of nice twists on the standard fantasy archetypes, and the main characters are believable and memorable. His world has a tremendous amount of detail.

I am completely susceptible to these kinds of stories, and Jordan seems like a smart and enthusiastic kind of writer guy.

Everyone, even hardcore fans of this series, mentioned that they understand why book one might not be for everyone, and I agree. I read it knowing it's going to be slow, that the focus would be on introducing characters and world building and that's what I got, so no complaints there. I still believe that epic fantasy doesn't have to be boring though. So, you'll get your 5 stars when that happens WoT :) ---------"

I never felt bored reading this book despite its 800 pages long. I also enjoyed Jordan’s sense of humor and I think it made the reading a lot easier and enjoyable. This book is good and solid fantasy. In a way, The Eye of the World reminded me a lot of LOTR but I found this positive because the story had a sense of familiarity, which made the beginning of the book a lot easier to understan"

The characters are so childish and immature you cannot help but-for the thousandth time-roll your eyes. Also, the plot came with scenes that went on for decades! Or so it seemed. It had to be explained-everything-from the ground to the sky for pages and pages and pages of just one scene! How boring! The writing was also not a very well pro to th"
5356,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,"This is the best book I have read in a long time. One of the main appeals in this book is that it satisfies our longing to be more than we are. That idea parallels Tolkien’s idea of insignificant hobbits performing deeds that shake the foundations of the earth. Although Jordan openly admitted to a little Tolkien emulation, similarities to the Lord of the Rings in no way detract from the grandeur of The Eye of the World.

Indeed, this novel does follow the Lord Of The Rings recipe. Perhaps even more faithfully than did The Sword of Shannara . However, much like the Shannara series, the tale veers off into it’s own direction once the opening scenes have rolled by. So, it is agreed then, EoTW is a LOTR clone.

5363,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,"So, does the Wheel of Time stand the test of time? Yes, it does. It is now one of the classics of high/epic fantasy. The world-building is truly impressive, but the real value in this series is the 'arc' of the larger story. It considers the 'winding gyre'/'wheel of fate' of myth, history and social development, showing how the same stories are told over and over, and how even characters repeat, but how small changes in person and plot can have the largest of significance. That is why it is impo"

5378,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,"My opinion is that this series of books is the best ever written in the field of high fantasy after Tolkien's great works of course. From the first time I read it, it made me such a good impression that I'm used to read it again and again so I can relive all the feelings that caused me. For this opinion I can argue quite a lot, but I think the best proof is this book. I do not know where to begin to describe his virtues. From its direct connection with the past of the genre?

The plot isn't original (innocent young farmboys venture out into the big bad world as one of them is the great chosen hero against the big evil), but it's a story with a classic theme well told, and the characterisation is absorbing, as is the world building. If you like fantasy, you owe to yourself to read this book. If you're just getting into fantasy, start with Lord of the Rings and work your way around to this."

The world Jordan created, excuse me, 'adapted' was fun and exciting. What would have made it better, for me, would have been a deeper philosophical dialog; however, as far as 'high fantasy' goes, this is one of the best I've read. T"
5403,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,"I like the story line in EotW, but not the pace. Some long stretches of ""nothing"", and then quick - but not well explained - action. I hope to see more human interaction in the next few books (especially Rand and Egwene, or Lan and Nynaive). Also, I am disappointed in the Glossary. Over half of what I try to look up is not in there. And I was stumped on ""the Eye of the World"" for most of the book. Was it a person, a thing, a place, etc? It finally got revealed at a level I could understand. Anyw"
5405,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,"This was my third or fourth time reading this book and I have to say it was absolutely the BEST because I got to experience it alongside my bestest buddy, David. The Eye of the World is the first book in an absolutely monumentally epic fantasy series started by the late Robert Jordan and completed by Brandon Sanderson. It has it all; action, adventure, danger, romance, magic, complex storylines, and characters you really grow to care for. Any fans of the fantasy genre need to experience this saga"
5406,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,"I enjoyed this book a lot, more than I ever thought I would honestly. I feel like you can tell when an author knows his world backward and forward, and Jordan is definitely in that class. Thought the world building was excellent, so many wonderful moments of feeling like I was right beside these characters in an inn or out on the road. Terrific stuff Liked most of the characters though none have really jumped out as favorites yet. Maybe Nynaeve, and from what I've read about Mat I think I'll real"
5407,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,2,"This is one of those lessons that shouts, ""There's no accounting for taste!"" Some of my best friends, and readers who shared very similar reading tastes with me, were wild about this series. So I had started it with a high confidence that I would love it as well. Nope. I found it pedantic and distant. It's been many years since I've read it, but I felt essentially repulsed by the story/writing."

5409,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,Honestly speaking this is my favorite book series of all time. I haven't been able to bring myself to read any books after Brandon Sanderson took over. I will someday but I just cant yet.

Then about the books. And then he was all ""But have you read ""The Wheel of Time"" series?"" Which I had not. So he gave me the first book, telling me that it was ""the best fantasy ever!""

5414,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,"Back around the time I graduated high school, I wasn’t much of a reader. The only books I had read voluntarily were pretty much Holes and The Lord of the Rings. Having been a big fan of Tolkien at that point I desperately searched out something similar to try and recapture the feeling I had reading him and watching the Lord of the Rings movies. I first went the natural route many go to CS Lewis’s Chronicles of Narnia, which I mostly liked. From there a friend had recommended Shanara series by Ter"

The Eye of the World took me on a long journey... horseback. My ass was sore by the end. Sigh. There were times when I thought the book was “a distinguished piece of fantasy literature” deserving 5 stars. Though, for a majority of it, I thought it was good (3 stars)—not excellent, nor great, just good. I bought the first three Wheel of Time books on Boxing Day (amen to my fav hol"

I understand that my three star rating of this book may be a point of contention for WHEELIES© (a name I came up with, you're welcome). However, the first book in any epic fantasy series is always a tough read. I gave THE BLADE ITSELF 3 stars and I LOVE THE FIRST LAW trilogy. So, what did this book have going for it? The heavily Celtic inspired world which is really interesting and DEEP. This world has thousands and thousand"
5419,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,3,"This one is very hard for me to rate. It took me soooo long to finish it. I started it and then didn't pick it up again for several months. MONTHS! But when I did, I was determined to finish it. For fantasy lovers, this book stands up with Lord of the Rings , The Hobbit , etc. It has elements of A Game of Thrones in it, but it is not similar in most ways to GOT. At times, The Eye of the World was a little too analogous with those other works. I know there are certain things that naturally come alon"
5420,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,"I just re-read the series this year. The series is spectacular and the world that Jordan creates is greatly detailed and absorbing. What really makes this series special is the political intrigues, a history to rival the Simarillion and characters that as you read the books build a certain fondness... Personally I like the idea of the void. Its basically the same concept that professionals in sports such as basketball or target shooting where one enters a state of hyper-concentration and the bal"
5421,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,"I remember reading this back in 10th grade and thinking it was great, but as the series progressed I felt overwhelmed by Jordan's writing and ended up dropping the series after the fifth book. Now, my friends have been urging me for a while to pick the Wheel of Time back up and read with them, and I finally said yes. I'm so glad I did. I love this book even more than the first time I read it. It just has that classic epic fantasy feel to it. There's not much originality to it, but I still couldn"

5423,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,"I guess this is the benchmark for epic fantasy, running at 14 books plus a prequel with the final book to be published in January 2013. The series is certainly epic, extremely long with a number of heroes and heroic deeds. The tale starts in a backwater district called the Two Rivers, Moiraine an Aes Sedai wielder of the one power and her warder Lan arrive in Emond's Field searching for a young man under the scutiny of the Dark One. Moiraine is unable to determine which of three youths Rand, Mat"
5424,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,"After much hesitation, I have finally decided to start this series that will stay with me for fourteen books. I was immediately charmed by the style and the atmosphere, rich of descriptions and details. Of course, now originality in fantasy is not so easily and here we have a company on the road, a chosen one, the evil is awakened (this reminds you of something?). But I must say I really liked the way the author has created this world, its people, their stories, customs and legends, that form th"
5425,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,"Limerick at the end. Contrary to all logic, I started this series with book 5. Then, I read 2 through 4, and finally I went back to the first before moving on. Now, this is a very Tolkienesque work in many aspects. It's very coming of age, plus the handsome dose of epic lore that builds the series. Not bad, but a little naive and less intense than what comes after. Once again, all of what I'm writing here is actually an almost 20-year-old memory, and not my current observation of the series. As of"
5426,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,"Massive in every sense of the word, Robert Jordan's Eye of the World begins one of fantasy's most read and well-loved (or loathed) series with a strong sense of adventure, furiously driven by every shade of darkness under the sun, as the young heroes of the series haltingly step into the boots of destiny. Challenged by pacing at times, The Eye of the World resonates well as an accessible stand alone fantasy novel with numerous classicist elements, while in the same token, promises a thick slathe"

I think I'm done with fantasy for a while(except rereads like Harry Potter, Robin Hobb's RoTE series and Cosmere). I'm sorta repulsed by the hero goes on a journey stuff because unless such stories do well in multiple aspects, they suck.

It is perfect in every way and that makes me sad because I know what's to come. I'll back up and give you my background with the Wheel of Time.

5436,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,2,"After countless praises I heard about these books being the ultimate fantasy series that beats even Middle Earth, I finally sat down to read the first book. Guess what, it’s nowhere near as good as Middle Earth. Starting with the title of the series itself, I didn’t like how time moves in an infinite loop. It made everything feel predetermined, like the characters are not choosing what they will do next as much as repeating the same events again and again. I also didn’t like how the hero in the i"
5438,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,2,"So, Robert Jordan. Since brevity is the soul of wit, I shan't be as wordulent as he in summarily dubbing The Wheel of Time the most obese hero's journey that I ever held the futile hopes of reading in its entirety. But, I finished this volume. And it only took two tries, and a whole lot of willpower. I even kind of liked this one most of the time. (Note: I'm reviewing six or seven years after having read the book. The details are sketchy, so I'll talk mostly in impressions.) I enjoyed the way Jord"

My geeky friends have been bugging me for years to read it, and I've been dragging my feet for a variety of reasons. Well, the book didn't get any shorter, obviously, but once I finally gave it a chance, I discovered that this is not the drearily epic saga I was expecting, but a relatively engaging high fantasy adventure. yes, the tone and pacing are ponderous, and yes, Jordan writes women rather oddly for my taste. But the world buildi"

I remembered loving it then and it did not disappoint when I picked it back up again recently. I am determined to finish the series now that the final book will be released this coming January. It is a captivating story with characters that grip onto you and don't let go. In this particular first volume the three main characters are Rand, Perrin and Mat, all of the"
5441,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,"For me, as for many of us of a certain age, this was my gateway into the world of fantasy. And this first book of the Wheel of Time series can always transport me back to that time. I remember when the genre felt new, and exciting, and like nothing else I had ever read. This was my first love. And it started me off on a road I have been on ever since. How can you rate your childhood? You can't. How can you review something that meant so much to you? You can't. How can you critique something that"

We follow a group for young people from The Two Rivers as they set out with Moiraine and Lan who can protect them. Moiraine is an wielder of the true source( magic) and has been hunting for Rand for a long time. I like the characters in this book but the women can be a bit annoying. The boys Rand, Mat and Perrin are OK, stubborn but all trying to cope with what life is dealing them. Egwyne is one I'm n"

I mean, I had it on my tbr pile because it's one of the first on the aficionado list (and I should really learn to trust that thing better), but being a hefty and somewhat obscure fantasy tome, I had pushed it to the back. Yeah, I know, I should know better than that. Anyway, I saw a paperback version poking out from a pile at a used bookstore and I knew I couldn't resist. The cover art looked really cute, anyway.

5444,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,The Eye of the World is the first in a fantasy series that has 14 total books. The first eleven are written by Robert Jordan. And books 12/13/14 are written by Brandon Sanderson. I've seen many different reviews on this book. Some people love it but don't want to continue on in the series. Because books down the road from what I've seen have been bad. And some people don't like this series because they say it's to similar to J.R.R. Tolkien the Lord of the Rings. You do follow a lot of different
5446,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,1,"First reaction: So far kind of lol... Last reaction: I didn't actually finish the book but I am done with the book. Another goodreads reviewer mentioned that Tolkien is a simplified derivative of Nordic legend, and that Jordan is a simplified deviation of Tolkien. Jordan however manages to still take an incredibly long time to tell his simplified story. I would agree with that. The book isn't awful, and if your a die hard fantasy genre lover maybe it will do it for you. But it is sort of dull and o"
5447,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,"[4 Stars] This was a very traditional Tolkien fantasy, but regardless of that, I still quite enjoyed it! The pacing of this book was a little strange. It would be slow and then fast and then slow again, and then towards the end things were just moving at a breakneck speed. That being said, I enjoyed both the action packed moments and the slower world building moments. This seems more than anything like a set up kind of novel which really just introduces us to the world and the characters and the"
5449,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,"The Wheel of Time put the ""WTF, are you shitting me?!, 14 novelS?!"" in epic fantasy. That was the main reason I was hesitant to start this series. I've always had commitment issues, and wasn't sure this was a series I wanted to settle down with. Oh well, I took the plunge and end up really liking the story. Big and sprawling, with wonderful world-building and a great cast of characters. I'm still not sure how far I am willing to go with this series, but for the moment we are getting along and ha"
5450,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,2,"This series lures you in. The author is a passable world builder. But the, at some point (for me the ninth book; I'm slow) you realize 1) All the women are cookie cutter characters 2) The only character you liked spent an entire novel buried under a wall 3) The whole series is one long sexual fantasy and 4) The man has written himself into a corner, has no idea where the story is going and is terrified. That's when I stopped reading, took all the hardback books (it's an addiction) to a second-han"

It's hard not to give 5 of 5 stars to a fantasy series that's had me in its grip for several decades, and which I've read the first five or six of over and over again. Despite any quibbles I may have with the books, and the series, Robert Jordan created something almost timeless, and amazing, and I love that!"

I had heard a lot of awful things about this series and author before I started, but a lot of good things also. From comments on other reviews of the Wheel of Time series, it's something that stirs up a lot of strong emotions - negative, or positive. For my part, 'it was okay' kind of sums up my response. I could go on about the similarities to Tolkien, as others have done so, but I feel that the similarities lessen the further you get into the"
5458,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,"Reviewing a legendary fantasy novel is a little intimidating. There is a lot of (imagined) pressure to fall head over heels with it. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case for me. I thoroughly enjoyed this adventure but I never really fell in love along the way. A large part of that was character relationships, which I'll get back to. People who live in small towns, off the beaten path, generally consider themselves safer than other people in the world. But when the biggest of the bads comes hunting"

The Eye of the World by Robert Jordan is the book that drew me into the reading world, and now the writing world. I’d read maybe ten novels before this one, usually because they were required reading for school.

Here is what I wrote at the hallway point ""I'm just about halfway through the book and it is just now starting to get interesting.

It is strange how book tastes transform. As I think back upon this story, I am starting to realize how wonderful it really is. I think when I read it my mind was closed off in a box of expectations, wanting something in the shadow of Stephen King or J.R.R. Tolkien. However, as I read now in a broader perspective of authors and styles, even genres, I open my mind mor"
5464,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,The Eye of the World (TEW) by Robert Jordan isn't very original. It is the standard heroic adventure with a standard group of friends/allies in a Tolkienesque journey. What it lacks in originality it makes up for with execution. While none of the characters are paragons of uniqueness- their stories and the potential scope of this tale is well done. The villain is essentially Satan- who has been locked away in Shayol Ghul and is trying to break free. The other elements of the story from the Aes S

He whisks them away from their comfortable home, a small rural village called Emond's Field, and thrusts them out into an adventure. He makes you like them and root for them and hope that, in the end, all of them -- Rand, Mat, Perrin, Egwene and Nynaeve -- make out ok.

For all the Wow I heard about this book, I was completely underwhelmed. Utterly predictable from start to finish. I had a hard time getting back to it for lack of real interest. None of the characters came alive for me.

Robert Jordan is amazing at getting you involved with his characters. Maybe the only downside is that as the series goes there are soooo many characters. Seriously. But i love it anyway. The first three book are the best because they focus more on my favorite characters. I really can't recommend this series more. it is great. He's even been said to equal or surpass Tolkien.

Each of these books are over 800 pages long. This series is so full of detail and contains so many subplots, I am astonished at how Robert Jordan could keep up with everything he put into these books. Someone needs to write a whole reference guide for these. At least for people like me, because I was constantly having to stop and try to remember who someone was and what had happened"
5473,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,I really did love this book. I did. I eagerly waited for the sequels. I did. I made it to the seventh book because I loved this one so much and I hoped the series would get better. It didn't. Jordan died. Blah blah blah. I blame word processors and poor editing for the horror this series became (let's face it if Jordan would have written this by hand it would have been a lot shorter and probably much better). I don't need in depth descriptions of people's clothes yada yada yada. I don't read a l

When I get sick of it, I move onto some Joe Abercrombie, then come back when I'm ready. Rand, Mat, and Perrin go on a journey with a wizard and a Warder (So does Egwene and Nyv!).

It didn't hurt that it was nominated for the Hugo, as she had been nominated over and over, winning several for her classic SF series, but I was like, ""What? Fantasy?

5480,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"Really three and a half stars. A slow start for me, but sometimes good stories take a while to build, and by the end, I couldn't put it down. There is an interesting mix of characters, somewhat archetypical but done well enough that they developed uniqueness. A feudal system, a failing monarch, an unscrupulous chancellor, a strong-minded but elderly female ruler, young heirs running wild, but all with twists that give them individuality. I do appreciate the hero, Cazaril, being developed more al"
5481,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"Fantasy books these days are often rough. They swear, they rape, they mutilate and pillage. They are dark or grimdark or ""realistic"". I like this trend a lot, but once in a while there comes a book that is none of that. Enter ""The Curse of the Chalion"". This book is polite. It's quiet and beautiful, perhaps sophisticated sometimes. It tells a great story and has a very relatable and likeable main protagonist. Cazaril, our main character and only view point perspective, is 35. In the course of the"
5482,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,I am myself surprised at how much I liked this book. Generally I prefer books that are plot driven. Now and then however a wonderful book comes along built on the characters within.This is definitely a character driven story. There is about this story (much of the way) a melancholy feel of the inevitable doomed hero moving inexorably toward his fate... to go on here about whether said hero meets said fate and so on would constitute (of course) THE spoiler of all spoilers. Let me say however that

5485,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"I've read Curse of Chalion twice over the years and loved it both times. It is a fantasy story with an original feel and with a truly unique main character. The story was not high on action but had plenty of intrigue and a dose of interesting magic and world building that resulted in it always being a compelling read. The story followed Lord Lupe dy Cazaril. At his peak he was a courtier, castle-warder, and captain; but now he has just escaped for the oar benches of a slave galley and is a shado"
5486,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"This is top notch quality fantasy. It has politics, scheming, a well defined system of gods and religion, well developed characters who all develop in leaps and bounds through the story. The story is a slow burner, but it’s so good you won’t care. It reminds me a little of the Dagger and Coin series (which is exceptional and one of my favourite fantasy series) and in terms of pacing, Robin Hobb, a definite contender for my favourite fantasy author). I hope the rest of the series lives up to its"

5488,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"“Well, what is a blessing but a curse from another point of view?” I’ve been reading fantasy for a long time, however The Curse of Chalion revealed a new variation of the genre for me, which I loved. Here we don’t get to know a fantastical world, action-packed adventure with strange and out of our experience characters. It reminded me of a medieval world with power struggles not unheard of, but at the same time ultimately unique. It’s profound in that it doesn’t pretend to be more than it is,"
5489,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,3,"3.5 stars. This is a well-written story filled with politics, adventures, blessings and magic. The main plot was straightforward and enjoyable although the prominence of gods and curses undermined the importance of the characters while making the political machinations seem somewhat trivial. The real strength of this book was in it's protagonist Cazaril. A decorated soldier, his betrayal and imprisonment left him a shattered husk at the beginning of this novel. More than a story of war and polit"
5490,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"A highly satisfying and timeless tale of a broken hero’s recovery. Those who expect a typical sword-and-sorcery fantasy from the title or cover will be disappointed. Fans of Bujold’s sci fi Vorkosigan Saga should feel right at home with the strengths evident here: character development, world building, complex enemies, great dialogue, understated romance, and limited but well-framed episodes of violence. In a Medieval setting of competing kingdoms, the nobleman Cazaril served Chalion well in one"
5491,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"“How strangely we are blinded by the surfaces of things.” What is a diamond? A lump of ordinary coal that took pressure exceptionally well. Castillar Lupe dy Cazaril is your diamond in this story. And please do not call him broken, there is nothing broken about the diamond, even before it is cut to gain the proper shine and brilliance. The Curse of Chalion is a story told from the margins of a great power play. You know all these books sporting princes and princesses fighting for or defending the"
5492,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"This is exactly the sort of fantasy I love. Slow to build, but full of great ideas and fantastic world and character development. At times it reminded me a bit of Hobb's writing style (this is very high praise from me) and I really enjoyed being able to follow a character who was 35 rather than a typical 'farmboy' etc. (although we all know I love a good farmboy story too) This book focuses around Cazeril, a man who has had one hell of a life. Cazeril is a war veteran at the age of just 35. He's"

Once a soldier and a lord, Cazaril is now almost to the end of his rope, destitute, friendless, and betrayed. The first part of the book is the story of how he rebuilds his life, and how his sense of honor brings him to continue giving his life and loyalty to Chalion even when he feels he has nothing left to give. It's a slow start - I didn't see what the point of it all was for quite a while. Ca"

I have, however, stripped a lot of wallpaper, painted skirting boards and ceilings, planed and re-hung six doors, packed, carried and unpacked an awful lot of boxes, built a couple of beds, a cot and a bookcase, battled cats into cages and entertained a toddler. This has nothing to do with Curse of Chalion, but having read a lot of Bujold's work and got a feel for how she thinks"
5495,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"What a great book! It reminded me to put everything by Bujold that I haven't read on my wishlist! Engaging characters meet an action-filled plot with tons of plotting and intrigue. I have to admit that this kind of ""castle intrigue"" is definitely one of my favorite genres of novels. I'd very much recommend this to fans of George R.R. Martin and Guy Gavriel Kay. My edition came with blurbs from Robert Jordan & Dennis McKiernan, and an ad for the latest Weis & Hickman - all of which, I must a"

Full Review I read this as the August pick for Sword & Laser . Despite considering myself more Sword than Laser (or maybe because I do?), I think overall I've been mostly disappointed with the Sword picks, especially the last two. This one however, did not disapoint. It starts a bit slow. The pacing reminded me a bit of Assassin's Apprentice , so you if you enjoyed those books, you may enjoy"
5498,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"I realized something as I was reading this book. Many fantasy books, when they involve any kind of court culture, have as their viewpoint character someone who doesn't know how it works, and blunders around until he or she figures it out. It's relatively rare to have the main character be someone who does know exactly how things work. Cazaril, the main character, is such a man. He isn't a quintessential courtier by any means, but he knows how things work. Note: The rest of this review has been wi"
5499,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"What a delightful world. The work that went into researching medieval Spain sows, as does theincrediblemimagination that went into turning the story into its own consistent telling rather than just a metaphor.

5501,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"I don’t know what anyone else looks for in their fantasy, but for me the number one requirement is characters I care about. This is hard to define, of course; I can’t describe what it is that creates emotional engagement in that way (if I could, I’d bottle it and sell it), but I know it when I see it. And Cazaril is it, indubitably and without question. From the moment he walks onstage in his rags on page 1, he is a man I care deeply about, someone I’m rooting for all the way. He’s not great hero"
5502,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"I loved this book so much and for so many reasons that I wish there was a 6-star rating. I happened to listen to an audio version of this novel, but I am considering reading it too just to take it apart and analyze under the microscope the writing style. Why? Because Ms. Lois McMaster Bujold's technique is probably as close to artistry as modern writing gets! Let me start by saying that I read several reviews (possible some of them were from Amazon) stating that the novel is too long and it shoul"
5503,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"A lovely, intimately told story of court intrigue and of the good people who are sorely tested to remain good in the midst of peril coming at them from all sides. There are moments of beauty and lots of quiet, good humor, that are brought to vivid life by a sharply-drawn and entirely believably human cast of characters. This was my first Bujold novel and it most certainly won’t be my last."
5504,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"4/5; 4 stars; A- This is great fantasy writing. I loved the character Caz. He starts out the story in a state of utter destruction. He is so damaged and sick and heart sore, yet at the same time brilliant and courageous and strong. Just the kind of main character I can really get behind. Under his tutelage his royal charge, Iselle, grows into her role and really shines. Another thing I liked about this book was the Five Gods themselves. The theology of this fantasy world is interesting. One of th"
5505,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"This was a wonderful fantasy, definitely different than the normal run. A unique theology & take on it is the backbone of the tale, so it's far more than just another hero hacking his way through the bad guys. In fact, if that's what you're looking for, read a different book. This one has complex politics, a semi-broken hero, romance, horror, & far more. This broken hero is different than Miles from her Vorkosigan series in many ways, but if you like those SF yarns, you'll probably like t"

The writing is elegant, the characters memorable and the story pulls you in from the very first pages."

They each have their special areas of godliness but the Bastard is like the thumb, able to touch and balance all the others. In a way, the Bastard is the most powerful. Yeah!

I don't usually care a lot for the standard epic fantasies--I like a little grit and realism mixed in--but this book was a definite treat! Cazaril has been a slave since being captured during a battle, and not ransomed.

5516,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,3,so well written that I read nearly half of it before the immense boredom of nothing happening caught up with me
5517,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,I loved this book. Here's why: 1. Court Intrigue - No one says what they mean. People will do anything to gain the favor of the people of a higher rank than them. There are a ton of rules of etiquette that must be followed. All of the above gives an author so many opportunities (with both subtle and not so subtle humour) to show the various shades of human nature. Bujold was an absolute master with both the characters who set out to master all things courtly and even better at showing the people
5518,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"I must admit I am guilty of typecasting Ms. Bujold. I am a hardcore and dedicated fan of her Vorkosigan series so I was a bit skeptical about this new, non-Miles book. I had a weird sense of displacement as I began to read it. It took a chapter or two to stop it, but I couldn't help trying to find Miles somewhere in there. Miles isn't there but the elegant writing and exquisite prose that are a hallmark of Ms. Bujold most certainly are. While the plot of this book is not groundbreaking or even pa"
5519,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"There are some books that I need to be in the right mood for. This is not one of those. The Curse of Chalion is one of the relatively few books that, no matter what mood I may be in, I can pick up and fall happily into. From the opening, where Cazaril - battered, bruised, and broken - seeks no greater boon than a place as a scullion in the castle where once he served as a page...the calm, golden days he spends as tutor to Iselle, sister to the heir to the throne...the frightening days in Cardegos"
5520,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"I read this in a marathon, started at 10pm, read til 4am, and then all day today--while I was getting a hair-cut, eating my leftover pasta for lunch, walking down the street to get coffee. So that gives an idea of the ability of Ms. Bujold to suck you into her world and only spit you out, exhausted and dizzy, at the final page. It is a first-class fantasy world, beautifully written, with one of those amazing, utterly unlikely Bujold heroes, Cazaril, marked as much by doggedness and decency as an"
5521,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"A nice way to start off the new year--the first book I finished in 2008 turns out to be, I think, a perfect genre novel. And it's not as easy to write one of those as you might think. You have to give your readers some of the conventions of the genre, because that's usually why they're reading it in the first place. You also have to make it seem fresh, not just a tired rehash of whatever came before. This book has all the stuff you look for in a political-intrigue-type fantasy (princesses, dark ma"

This is one of those books where things keep getting enjoyably worse, until you're gulping the book down with no idea what's going to happen next. Things I liked: - the setting!!! Ahh! This is a very medieval/Renaissance-Spain-inspired fantasy world, which I thought was just the coolest thing, and gave the world a very distinct feel to the stock-standard northern European setting"

Unlike the Vorkosigan books, this one is strictly fantasy (rather than science fiction). As I had expected, Bujold does a great job with the world-building in this and her characters are well developed. I was intrigued by the Quintarian religion: they worship The Father, The Mother, The Son, The Daughter and the Bastard (and by the Roknari variant which omits The Bastard). In her sci fi epic"

I’m a fan of Bujold’s Vorkosigan Saga, so I was expecting the same kind of clever, lighthearted, exciting adventure. What I got instead was something slow and powerful. This is very much a fantasy book for grownups. The protagonist is very different from most others, in a good way. A former soldier determined to avoid fighting as much as possible.

5531,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,2,"Revised from 3 down to 2. I really like her scifi a LOT better. I found the hero too good to be true - I mean almost a parody of a hero at times. The world is the tired old medieval-cum-fantasy world, the story fairy tale like with what you know is going to be a happy ending - therefore no suspense, of COURSE Cazarel is not going to die for Pete's sake. Fortunately all threads are tied up so I do not feel any compulsion to continue. In fairness, it may have had a lot to do with the narrator, Llo"

Now that all is said and done, I absolutely love this book. No holds barred, hands down, pick another cliche. It's a wonderful book that uses Fantasy to re-examine Earth History (in this case, the story of Ferdinand & Isabella) and also ponder the Mystery. There's enough world history and metaphysics hiding beneath the folds of this story to make it three-meals'-worth of delectab"
5537,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"A truly superb fantasy novel! To a world vaguely similar to 15th century Spain, Bujold has added a totally original religious system, a complete theology, a teeming cast of gripping characters, and some of the finest set pieces you could ever wish for. The depth of the world and story is just a pleasure to see -- she is a writer's writer. The story follows Cazaril, a minor official in the kingdom of Chalion, as he rises from street-vagrancy to responsibility and love. Hairpin turns of plot, high"

I certainly am glad they did, although if Goodreads allowed it I would give it 4-1/2 stars instead of the full 5, simply because I feel the ending was rushed as if the author was ready to get this situation done and the book sent out. I felt this especially in the case of the romantic resolution for the protagonist. However, overall I really enjoyed this tale of a bedraggled, galley ship su"
5546,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"I don't need to heap more accolades on this already beloved book (which was actually published more recently than I originally thought), but as I am widely known as The Guy Who Hates Everything, take it from me that this book is well worth your time. You can read a dozen synopses about the plot, raves about the character of Cazaril, praise for the writing, so I'm not going to do that here. Suffice it to say those people are all correct. One of the thngs that often bothers me about stories is their"
5547,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"Curse of Chalon: Slow-burn, thoughtful and complex fantasy I don't have enough time these days to write a proper review, certainly not a review sufficient to do justice to this quasi-historical adult fantasy tale about a melancholy and broken older character, dark magic and curses, a feisty young heroine, and a fascinating fantasy world loosely inspired by the historical drama of Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon, who united Spain in the 15th century, but with Bujold's signature sk"
5548,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"The world building is fascinating. The main character was in danger of the too-good-to-be-true trope. Fortunately(?) he was made human by his sufferings. The first 1/4 exuded much weariness I can almost taste it. The prose was lovely and painted images in my head. Ms. Bujold did not disappoint. By the way, like typical fantasy novels, the book introduced me to plethora of characters with dramatic names and strange terms within the first dozens pages. It was made worse by the very slow beginning"
5549,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,3,"I'm giving this 3 stars because in the beginning and for quite some time, II was actually very interested and totally enjoying the story. But then at a certain point I started to lose interest. I ended up dropping it today after about an hour of listening when I realized how bored I was and I just didn't care what happened anymore in the story. So, I'm onto other things now..."
5550,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"This is an excellent fantasy novel by an author who excels in creating believable worlds with sympathetic and engaging characters - highly recommended. The religious aspects of this novel are particularly fascinating, with gods and goddesses who intervene in the characters' lives believably, not as dei ex machina ."
5551,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"The Curse of Chalion is good classic fantasy. It’s intriguing but slow in pace, and it’s the perfect book to pick up after an exhilarating page-turner. Just finished reading a dark book and need something lighter? This is your book. Curious about adult fantasy books but wary about violence/mature content? This is your book. Hesitant about fantasy because it’s your least read genre? This is your book. Bujold’s conservative and hopeful tone to her writing is something rarely seen in fantasy these d"
5552,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"No spoilers. Book Two of a series, but can really be read as a standalone, and the first book written in the series. We find our main character Caz, downtrodden, poor and broken, journeying his way back to the castle where he served as a squire. He is lucky enough to be recognized by the dowager of the castle and is taken in to become a tutor, and becomes embroiled in their lives. Bujold creates a strong willed character in Caz, who is enjoyable to read."
5553,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"This was my first taste of Lois McMaster Bujold and I will definitely be back for me. While the magic was very understated and there were no fantastic creatures or races to mark this as a fantasy, nonetheless it was a fantastic tale of dynastic misfortunes, political machinations and self-sacrificial secretaries. Cazaril was the embodiment of a humble intelligent man seeking respite from his wearing and near fatal travels. We meet him on the road , walking back to Valendra, fondly remembered from"
5555,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"Originally posted at The Bibliosanctum A shadowy curse hangs over the royal family of Chalion and it falls to a broken man to save them from the curse and the political viper pit that threatens to bring them down. I fell in love with Cazaril not long after he was introduced. When he first appears, he is a broken man in both body and spirit. He has some how survived betrayal that led him into the hands of vicious slavers and is slowly making his way back to the royal family he serves. His restraint"
5556,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"A surprisingly sweet and heart-warming read, given the plot's heavy reliance on rape and pain. Lots and lots of pain. Whooee. Caz out-agonizes most other protagonists put together: he spends about 80% of the book simultaneously dying and being eaten alive by a vengeful spirit. And no, these aren't the standard novelistic injuries where the fight continues with the protagonist apparently impervious to pain due to narrative convenience adrenaline. Caz hurts. A lot . Emotionally and physically. Enou"
5557,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"By Thor and Odin's magical bracers I loved this book. Given that I have a weakness for character driven stories, this was hardly a surprise, but I did go in with very high expectations, and that normally means I set myself up to fail. It is easier to like a steam punk shifter romance you expect nothing but a lot of brain bleach usage from than it is to like something you've been considering reading for a very long time by one of your favourite authors. Bujold's Vorkosigan -series is solid and enjo"
5558,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,3,"The curse of the Chalion is a fantasy novel set around historical events of Spain. Due to that fact the book might remind people of GGK, although their styles are very different. Overall the book was enjoyable thanks to a well written character, the setting as well as excellent writing. 1.Plot The story is that of Cazaril, a Lord who was sold off into slavery thanks to people who mean him harm in the court. We see the world of medieval Spain through his eyes as he joins as a tutor to Iselle, a ro"
5559,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"Imagine the unholy lovechild of A Song of Ice and Fire, The Belgariad, the last 2 chapters of The Lord of the Rings, and The Princess Bride, in the best possible way, and you get The Curse of Chalion. (That means, I really liked it) The building blocks aren't terribly new or original, but very well handled to make a compulsively readable story, Cazaril is a great narrator, whose sarcastic point-of-view keeps him from sliding into ""I'm super special"" territory. There's brave, smart ladies, rather l"
5560,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"Despite the fact that this book was quite a long time on my TBR, my expectations were quite high due to the excellent rating and reviews. Nevertheless, I went into it without knowing what it’s going to be about (except fantasy of course) and thought, that this would be a trilogy. However, this book stands very well on its own and currently, I feel no need to read the other two books, that take place in the same world but not time… Still it was a very good and character-driven story that follows a"
5561,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"This was a great fantasy with very well rounded characterization. Cazaril is a man in need of solace. Scarred both mentally and physically and aged beyond his years he returns to the House of Chalion where he served as a page in his youth. He is then appointed secretary to the royess and her lady in waiting. Treachery, politics and, of course, the curse of Chalion, all distrupt Cazaril's solitude. At times, the pace is a tad too slow, but the interesting characters kept me hanging on to the very"
5562,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"I don't know whether it was my mood going into it, or the book itself, but I simply could not put this one down. It's the first time in a while that I've blown off so many of my miscellaneous obligations to spend a couple of daylight hours reading. Obviously, I really enjoyed it. The theology and depiction of sainthood within that were quite interesting, as was the main character's gradual rise through the book. There was a bit toward the end where I felt like it might be starting to drag a bit,"
5563,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"(4.5 stars) The book was slow to start, but I'm so, so glad I pressed on. The payoff in the end is *almost* on par with the Count of Monte Cristo. Usually, I'm skeptical and annoyed by too much theology in my books, but I thought the five gods was woven really well into the plot of this book. Even in the end, when things got all metaphysical, it made sense within the story. Although the protagonist is a man, I was happy to see so many strong women in the story as well."
5565,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"I had almost forgotten just how much I adore this book! I'm glad I remembered my love for it enough, to think to re-read it - or listen to it this time, as the case may be..."
5566,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"I do five stars very rarely. I go into superlative mode rarer still. This book gets both. Bujold creates a fantastic character in Cazaril, a man we meet after a series of adventures that would have broken a lesser man. Humbly, he walks across a country to a place he once lived to seek a simple place, maybe in the kitchens. Instead, he falls into intrigue as the Roya makes him secretary and tutor to her daughter, much to his surprise. While he can fight, Cazaril isn't a sword welding action hero."
5567,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"I'm really not sure how this book slipped past my radar but I am sad it took me so long to get it. Props to my friend who told me it would be exactly my jam: my jam, it definitely was. :) This is a slow build, character driven political fantasy, of a type that I love - if you need immediate action, snark, or a breakneck pace, this won't be for you. It's told entirely from the perspective of Caz, a physically broken ex-soldier returning to the place he served as a boy to escape the attentions of"
5568,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"A meticulously plotted, witty and engrossing read that reminded me why I like fantasy so much. Each event and description has its place and relevance, put together to create a flawlessly functioning story. It's not a particularly challenging novel: there's no great subverting of fantasy reader expectations, no working class revolution - but it does focus on goodness and kindness and decency rather than daring and war-time heroism. The novel achieves a good balance of focusing on story, character"
5569,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"There's just something about the combination of court intrigue, meddling gods, and witty banter that sings to my soul as a reader. The Curse of Chalion contains all three. It also contains women who know their own minds and make their own decisions and use their own resources to save themselves, something of which I'll always approve. I think Caz, the protagonist may be one of my all-time favorite characters."
5570,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"I was pretty distracted and nervous a few days ago and feeling somewhat down so I wanted a comfort reread, but I had already reread all the Elantra books by Michelle Sagara West recently. I didn't want to read a paper book either, because I can't change the font size when my eyes act up or get tired, so I took out my recent e-purchase of one of my favourite Bujold fantasies (there was a sale or a coupon or something). I've just finished it and it really feels like it redirected my spirit and refre"

I'm not going to do it justice in this review, but then again, I'll probably read it again in 6 months and I can write another review then. The Curse of Chalion is a masterpiece not only because it's perfectly plotted and deep"
5572,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"Bujold needs 6 chapters to bring the world and the characters with all it's names and themes to the reader. Only then, she allows the novel to take up high speed. I tagged it as a historical fiction because it takes up 15th century mediaeval Spain - or more exactly: the kingdom of Castile and León - and tells the tale of how Isabella of Castile got to marry Ferdinand of Aragon and all of their relatives. But it is more a fantasy novel - the historical characters are named differently, set in a d"
5573,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"I loved this book so much. What a great way to start out a new year of books. This world the author created is fully realized from religion (awesome!!) to politics to geography (although, there is no map, but I can still visualize one in my head from her descriptions) to language. It was such a joy to be immersed in this world. The story is a slow burn for sure. It picks up a little when they get to the capital, but even then some might find the plot lacking. That, however, would be a mistake. Th"

Oh and there was this world where they worshiped, among others, a God of Death - the Bastard - who also cared for orphans and the undesirables. Why yes, the protagonists and"
5577,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"This was an easy story for me to be drawn into, character-driven — and how! Lupe dy Cazaril is not your typical fantasy hero. He is a man damaged, betrayed, and afraid. This, of course, begs the question: How on earth is he going to accomplish his heroics? The use of demons and gods is complex and intriguing, providing a unique religious presence that — while a significant aspect of the story — is not ""preachy."" Bujold handled it neatly, showing the entirely human tendency to wander back and fort"
5578,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"I am in love with Bujold after reading only two of her many books. The quality of her writing is leaps and bounds ahead of the rest of the genre. Masterly world-building, magical systems, weapons and armor, adventurous journeys, soaring ramparts, gods and demons, love-in-bloom, Bujold has it all and can turn a delectable phrase. That said, her characters would much sooner talk their way out of a fight, or skewer their opponents with words. This is a blessing, and at the same time a curse. You see"
5580,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"A fine story, a well built world, and a mature and honorable man as its protagonist. Well done. If you want to read about a woman who is the hero of her own story, you have to wait for the next book, Paladin of Souls. The ladies are secondary characters here. All the same, they're endowed with intelligence, spirit, and courage, which I appreciate. I also love the loyal friendship between Royesse Iselle and her lady in waiting, Betriz -- the kind of female friendship I wish we saw more of in SFF. U"
5581,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"This is one of the best works of fantasy i have read recently. The book starts with the hero lupe dy cazaril on the road, making his way to valanda, the closest place he has got to a home. He is not the typical fantasy hero-Young and just coming of age and entering the world for the first time. He is rather a middle aged and broken down man who has already seen and experienced a lot. What follows is a wonderful building of cazaril’s character and his journey. All the major and minor characters in"
5582,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"In the last couple of months I have read all of Bujold's Vorkosigan Saga. I am not sure what I expected in this totally different book/series (fantasy not sci-fi, to begin with, otherwise I had no idea) but it is awesome. The main character is multi-faceted and interesting and the story is told from his sometimes troubled and confused viewpoint, which changes over time as he learns more about what is really going on. Once again, I am enthralled by Bujold's creativity and her gift with the writte"
5584,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"This is a epic fantasy. The characters are well defined, the plot is rich and the story has a great mix of adventure, magic and romance. My only drawback is the names of the characters. It's like the author threw the alphabet into a hat a and just used whatever she pulled out in whatever order they came in. Luckily the narrator, Lloyd James read it on the audio I listened to and he pronounced them. He has the voice of a natural story teller and really brought the characters to life."
5585,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"Oh my gosh! This was so good. On Reddit this book was described as really comforting and having finished it I know what they meant. I just really enjoyed it. The magic made sense and was consistent, there was quite a lot of political action but it was all really easy to understand. Pacing could be a little uneven but still very enjoyable"
5586,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"I'm doing something I never do, rounding up. This book is a solid 4.5 stars, but I'm rounding up because there's just something about it, that I can't really pin point, that I loved so much. I loved Cazaril. He was a great, flawed character. And the writing style was eloquent and flowing. I listened to this on audio and need to give the narrator a round of applause. Overall good read."
5587,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,3,"3.5 solid book, loved the characters, setting and dialog. Think this fell victim to expectations that were too high due to reading prior reviews. Loved Cazriel. Wish there had been more around the 'gods' etc. didn't feel as much of a fantasy as it did a political drama."
5588,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"*** FBR Buddy Read *** This book really sucked me in after the first few chapters were over... interesting world/religion, minimalistic romance, great characters... planning (already started) to read more Lois McMaster Bujold, and not just this series..."
5589,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"I really enjoyed this, and I'm moving right on to the next one, Paladin of Souls . I liked the understated magic, the intriguing religion, the quiet romance, the physically infirm hero, and always Bujold's touches of humor."
5590,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,4 stars for the story and one more star for the performance ! Great Audiobook!
5591,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,Amazing dialog and interesting philosophy on the existence of heaven. Plus a nice fantasy tale.
5592,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"A spiritual fantasy novel with a mature protagonist, what more could I ask for? Oh, maybe some perfect writing? Yep, it's got that too. This book goes far beyond expectations. 5/5 Cazaril is an old 35 year old. In his life he has been in battles all across the world. He's gone from being a page to a soldier to a general to a slave. All he wants now is a simple life but the Gods have different plans for him... Starting off slowly yet beautifully, this book makes you fall in love with its protagonis"
5593,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"“If you lent me a razor now, for me to cut my throat with, it would save ever so many steps.” Feared they weren’t writing fantasy like this anymore. Excellent in every way. Good world and cosmology building, deep first person point of view, maybe romance, a map, humor. A satisfying ending. What more could a reader want? More? Well, there’s that, too. Bujold is a master. “His heart melted. Or maybe it was his wits.” Unique among current fantasy because this world has several fully developed religion"
5594,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"Finally! I've been venturing out, trying out new fantasy authors, and finally, finally I came across one I love. I really like Bujold's writing (nothing about it that rubs me as contrived and fake), she crafted wonderful characters within an engaging story, that didn't seem cliche whatsoever. I am a sucker for a quality likable protagonist, mysteries, surprises and happy endings, all of which I got in this book."
5595,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,4 1/2 stars - love this author & this looks like it will be another great series
5596,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"A very good fantasy novel. I'd heard of Ms Bujold before, but this is the first time I've read any of her work. Based on this book, I'd should read more."
5597,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"This book is a slow burn, but the protagonist is one of the best protagonists I have encountered in 25 years of fantasy stories, and getting to know and understand him is well worth it. 4.5 stars."
5598,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"A unique world with a peculiar interaction between humans and gods, a unique story, and a unique MC who proved to be a very reluctant hero. I did expect some of the twists, but that did not detract from my overall enjoyment. A bit more action and a bit less intrigue would have made it even better, but still, it was well worth reading!"
5599,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"4.0 out of 5 stars The Curse of Chalion is beautifully written high fantasy novel with court intrigue, an interesting religious structure, and a varied cast of likable characters. The story follows a former castillar named Cazaril who attempts to put his life back together after being wronged by a rival. Cazaril is incredibly easy to root for and his story arc is very satisfying. This book has done a nice job of filling the Robin Hobb-less void in my life and I look forward to reading the other no"
5600,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"First posted at Fantasy Review Barn Another example of me finding a book that it feels everyone else already knew about, raved about, and left me wondering why the hell I have not read it before. ‘The Curse of Chalion’ is my first reading of Bujold, but will certainly not be my last. Here is an author who knows how to play with pacing, keeping the duller times in the character’s lives interesting somehow, but providing occasional action scenes that don’t lack either. Even better in my mind, the v"
5601,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"10/10 I have read nearly all of Lois McMaster Bujold's science fiction Vorkosigan saga, and found them fun to read, but not light in terms of characters and themes. This, the first of the fantasy Chalion trilogy, is similar--impressive in plotting and characterization, yet so readable that the pages flew by. My only complaint is the lack of a map."
5602,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"The first of the Five Gods series This is a re-read – or a re-listen because this time it's the audio-book. Bujold is my favourite author and of all her books this is my favourite, so this is a five star review before I even start. I wasn't sure I liked Lloyd James' narration to start off with, but it quickly grew on me. Cazaril, once courtier, courier/spy, captain and castle warder, now a homeless, hungry and ragged refugee, is walking from Ibra, across Chalion to Valenda, home of the Doawager Pr"
5603,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"I can't believe I never read this one until now! It's so good. Caz is A+ woobie, the good end well and the bad end badly (and the scene where the wrath from high atop the thing does in fact strike was DEEPLY satisfying), and I loved the young noblewomen and how smart they were and how believable it was that Iselle would end up as a very powerful leader. The magical/religious system was pretty great too."
5604,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"This book is one of my all-time favourites; I re-read (or more usually, re-listen) to it several times a year. Cazaril is not your usual fantasy protagonist: he isn't the clean-cut, heroic type; he's in his middle-thirties, and pretty much everything in his life has turned out to be a disaster. The book opens with him standing in the road, dressed like a beggar, having walked several hundred miles to get home after nearly two years as a galley-slave. This is a man who has hit rock bottom. He's wo"
5605,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"Overall: A little slow to start, but oh so worth hanging in there! What a beautiful, well-written story. 5 stars The Good Stuff : 1) This is a character-driven story, and one of the best I've ever encountered. Told entirely from the perspective of Lupe dy Cazaril, it takes us along on his journey from a broken man to...well, I can't really say without ruining the book for you. While there's plenty going on, much of the story takes place inside his mind. I know that sounds boring as all get out, but"
5606,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,3,"This book came highly recommended, so maybe it's inevitable that I was disappointed. As far as fantasy goes, it's somewhat above average, but still didn't really do it for me. The Curse of Chalion follows its nontraditional hero, Cazaril--a man in his mid-thirties who's failed at most of his endeavors, and is recovering from a stint as a galley slave--as he becomes tutor to the princess Iselle and helps her navigate the waters of a treacherous court. The story is driven more by character than pl"
5607,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"The Curse of Chalion! I love this book. I love this series, and I generally love everything that Bujold writes, but Curse of Chalion is one of my very favorite books period. I love Cazaril and his general long-suffering conviction that he's going to die so he might as well get as much stuff done as possible before he kicks it, I love Iselle and her bloody-minded stubbornness and strength, I love Betriz's cleverness and kindness and compassion and similar bloody-minded stubbornness (everything ab"
5608,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,2,"In my opinion, this isn't a fantasy--it's a very slow single-character-driven political 'thriller,' approximately 8 parts politics, 2 parts theology. I don't mind slow pacing--so long as it's deliberate and eventually pays off. Instead there are long passages with people sitting there recounting what just happened...for the forth time. Or maybe I just haven't read enough Jane Austin to appreciate this sort of 'realism.' Still, not knowing that the pay-off wasn't going to come about, I did feel c"
5609,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,3,"I think I may be in the minority with this book. It was very....eh for me. Bujold is one hell of a writer, don't get me wrong, and the story was interesting but amazingly predictable. The ending was disappointing, cliche to the point of being nauseating. The characters were very black-and-white. I think the problem might be with me, rather than the actual book. I just don't think this is really where my reading interests lie. I'm not a fan of black-and-white situations and characters. I don't en"
5610,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,4.5 Well written and thought provoking.
5611,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"I was pleasantly surprised to find a fantasy novel by Bujold as the book selection for August 2013 in the ""Sword & Laser"" book club. I've always thought of her as a SF writer, so I approached this with some skepticism. But I ended up enjoying it quite a bit. The story is about another cripple, possibly inspired by Tyrion Lannister and certainly informed by Miles Vorkosigan: dy Cazaril grew up as a noble page, then distinguished himself with honor as a soldier for years before he was ""mistaken"
5612,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,3,"Mmmmm, Dreamy. Savouring CoC is like sweet homecoming, nestling in a security blanket with a hot cocoa and Kleenex and being lulled with the promise of a safe and steady steer through chartered waters to the inevitable happily ever after. A Fantasy only in as much as names of places are make belief, and a coterie of undefined but ebullient gods seem to be popping up straight from the annals of greek mythology, but discretely and background fillerish, this good old fashioned historical adventure"
5613,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"A very refreshing read, entertaining to the end. I say refreshing because the plot of almost all fantasy I've read develops in a anglo-saxon kind of setting, while The curse of Chalion takes place in more of an alternate reality medieval-Spain. Being myself a tropical man, I yearn for a tropical-native author of fantasy who would venture to bring their characters to life within the landscapes of the tropics... all of the fantasy books I've read center heavily on the passing of seasons... for us"
5614,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"Golly, I don't even like high fantasy much and I'm entranced. Bujold is just that good. She paints these remarkably sympathetic characters who somehow manage not to be flat or simple or too idealized anyways. Cazaril is really charmingly humble about his heroism; gah, maybe the first adult male character I've actually admired in literature in months (the last one might have been Miles Vorkosigan). And the ladies aren't subject to endless shallow adulation, but written as developed people with qu"
5615,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"The strength of this story is in is characters, who are incredibly well fleshed-out, strikingly human, very believable, and more often than not quite likeable. Also a huge plus are that despite a standard patriarchal fantasy world, the novel contains a number of intelligent, active, well-portrayed female characters who exist and work of their own right rather than acting as props or foils for the male characters. The story itself is interesting and has good momentum and a few interesting twists,"
5616,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"Dammit, I hadn't planned on this but now I'll have to read the rest of the books in this series. And Bujold continues to give me at least one passage in each book to laugh out loud at: ""Men write poems to the objects of our desire in order to lure them closer."" ""How practical. In that case, you'd think men would write more poems to ladies' private parts."" ""The ladies would hit us. Lips are a safe compromise, being as it were a stand-in or stepping-stone to the greater mysteries."" ""Hah. Anyway, I des"
5617,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"I don't think I will be able to adequately descibe quite how good The Curse of Chalion is because it is so very complex and detailed and so, well completely excellent. It has a hero who is more in the anti-hero mold, someone who starts out at the beginning of the story as a broken man, and who stays broken in one way or another right the way through the story whilst effecting change in a quiet, subtle and self-effacing way. The characterisation of Caz is quite, quite brilliant. He rates with Mile"

After a disatrous campaign, he had been sold as a galley slave, and freed only by a chance capture by another navy. At the castle, the Provincara remembers him from when he was a page there.

I don’t have too much to say now, either. I think this is competently written, though at times the writing style is inconsistent and doesn’t seem to flow with the rest of the narrative. I think the characters themselves have compelling moments. But mostly, I think I’ve read about thirty other books set in this same world, and I’m dinging this book for that. How"

Slow pacing-Maybe if you're used to fast action/thriller type stories; I'd agree for the first quarter of the book but I'd compare it to a relaxing Sunday afternoon stroll. One dimensional characters-By this I mean very clear cut good vs evil no shades of gray. I would agree with this statement, it seems to belong in the ""old school"" of fantasy and this didn't bother me at all. Too predictable-I guess I can see that but come on, what's wrong with a happ"

Cazaril returns to the household in which he once served as a page. Now though, he isn't a boy, but a man that has been through dangerous situations that took everything from him. He is named secretary to the sister of the heir to the throne. This new role will lead him to the court of Cardegoss where old enemies and intrigues are threatening him and Iselle... I admi"
5622,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"Boy can this woman write. This is a wonderful fantasy story about a broken man, Cazaril, recovering himself. The story of our hero and what has happened to him enfolds slowly, and more and more the reader begins to empathize and understand just who Cazaril is. I would say that this is a very spiritual read about guilt and redemption, about courage and sacrifice and putting ""the right thing to do"" over one's own interests. I loved it and wished I had written it! It won the Mythopoeic Fantasy Awar"
5623,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"A rare fantasy book that is a real book - not a set up for the next 10 books! Like all of Lois McMaster Bujold's books, this is character driven with like able but imperfect characters, and the political observations are spot on. The religious culture is well thought out and interesting, and the relationships and conversations are all possible and believable in the context. One of the reasons I love nearly all her books is that I never feel like yelling at the main characters telling them that t"
5624,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"Well, this book is a bit pedestrian, I thought as it slowly meandered along...but I.could.not.put.it.down. Was totally irritated when I had to put it down to eat. Stayed up much later than usual because I HAD to finish it. Unlike the other two series (The Sharing Knife and Miles Vorkosigan) the POV stays the same in this story. Good thing, too, as there is a lot to experience, observe and absorb. In spite of the build-up and reader preparation, I was totally blown away by the climax. I am also v"
5625,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"Rereading Shards of Honour recently I (re)found a statement that so perfectly describes why I love Bujold's books. Cordelia, replying to the wily Emperor Ezar, says that she and Aral are both pursuing the same thing, though by different names: honor or the grace of God. And this book feels like an achingly perfect example of that 'pursuit,' no matter how many times I read it."
5626,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"As usual, her writing is superior. Her main character isn't perfect, he has flaws, but not flaws that make you dislike him. Her religion is fascinating, and her world is interesting. Rather than borrowing from real life, she creates her own titles (Royse for prince, Royesse for princess, etc.). Her story is gripping, and you aren't sure of the outcome until very near the end. The main character is likeable as are the supporting characters. The villain is despicable, and very easy to hate. Typica"
5627,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"In many ways, this book is a departure from standard fantasy fare. All of the tropes are there (swords, castles, kingdoms in peril, magic), and yet this reads as much like a serious exploration of 16th century court conspiracies as it does a rip-roaring fantasy adventure. Although perhaps a bit slower than optimal and although its protagonist comes across as a little *too* self-effacing at times, there's really not much to complain about here. The plot is well thought out, the language precise,"
5628,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"While this book took me some time to get into, I found myself slowly being drawn into the complicated and intriguing story that it became. The world was well developed and I really came to trust and care for Cazaril. With plenty of twists and turns and What was that? moments (and many rereadings of pages) I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next. I enjoyed the thoroughness and care that the author took when writing this story and look forward to reading more from her."
5629,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"I think I enjoyed this even more the second time around. This author has such a great talent for writing interesting, flawed but sympathetic characters and I enjoyed following Cazaril on his journey through the book. A must for fans of high fantasy."
5630,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"This is on my short list of favoured books of all time. ""When the souls rise up in glory, yours shall not be shunned nor sundered, but shall be the prize of the gods' gardens. Even your darkness shall be treasured then, and all your pain made holy."""
5631,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,I already was pretty sure I would like this from the reviews. Apparently I have a thing for decent heroes ;-) And I thought the religious concept fascinating. I loved following this story of a terrible curse and the people who fight it to its dramatic and satisfying conclusion.
5632,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,1,"I managed to read seven chapters of this book but the author focused enough on the 34 year old protagonist being aroused by the 16 and 19 year old girls that he’s tutoring... well, I had to put it down. If that’s something that squicks you, avoid this book!"
5633,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"4.5 Stars A really fantastic work of fantasy. Gods meddling in mortal lives, political intrigue, quite a bit of darkness--all of which I'm a huge fan. Lloyd James was amazing as the soft spoken Caz, and this was a wonderful audio production overall."
5634,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"This is like the polar opposite to A Song of Fire and Ice—the bad guys get what's coming to them, the good triumph and the gods smile down upon the world. A very interesting take on theology and court politics."
5635,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,Goodreads needs more stars for this book. Five just don't suffice.
5636,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,I love this book! It's amazing!

5644,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"I don't want to just repeat all the gushing reviews about this book that have already been written, and I generally agree with them, so I'll just talk about an aspect that fascinated me – the religion. The worship of the Five Gods is central the story, and I find religions and their sociological impacts interesting. The people of Chalion are known as Quinterians, and they worship a set of five deities styled the Father, Mother, Daughter and Son, each linked with a season, traditional colors, a st"

I wasn’t entirely sure what to expect when I began reading this novel, and I"
5646,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"This book is just great and just a pleasure to read, even when it moves into real darkness. A man returns from war and slavery to beg for a position from someone who once knew him as a boy. The novel begins so simply and yet the heights it reaches feels more and more inevitable as it goes on. There are villains but few heroes, and even the villains are mostly put there by circumstance and godly indifference. A curse plagues a nation and our cowardly protagonist, Cazaril, must break it. It all fee"
5647,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"I picked this one up on a whim because I kept hearing good things about it that weren't specific enough to entice me to read it. For this reason, I decided to start it while I was having a weak moment, because it was doubtful I'd ever pick it up otherwise. I'm glad I did. The book is astoundingly sedate, relying almost entirely upon court intrigue and a masterfully unwinding mystery of divine intervention for its forward momentum. It's also entirely plot-based, by clever design. As I mentioned, t"

Captured in battle and somehow left off the ransom list he winds up the oarsman on a slaver ship, getting treated as well as most slaves get treated (i.e. terribly) before fate intervenes and gets him washed ashore with only the clothes on his back, no money, a broken body and his slowly recovering wits, any one of which is a step up from where he was before. With nowhere else to go, he walk"
5649,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"A sophisticated and complex book for any genre, despite sounding (and sometimes looking) like a run of the mill high fantasy tome, The Curse of Chalion is an exploration of faith, as much as it's a page turning adventure. Set in the fictional country of Chalion, in a vaguely medieval setting, the story centers around Cazaril, a Castilliar of the realm (something like a lord) who has recently returned to what is left of his home after being sold onto a slave ship. He enters into the service of h"
5650,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"Spending a lazy day in bed after my first full night shift, today seems like the perfect time to finally do the proper review of this book that I promised in my first, short reaction a few weeks ago. (The essence of that first reaction, for the record, was that 1.) this book belongs to a subgenre – medieval fantasy – that I'm not too fond of, yet I ended up loving it a lot, and 2.) it made me cry, twice, which is highly unusual.) The Curse of Chalion , on my first read, left me with a strong impre"
5651,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,3,"What are you looking for in a fantasy novel? Things this book does well: 1. Create likeable characters 2. Have a plot that is not a LotR or HP clone. It's more like a junior version of A Game of Thrones . 3. Create a fleshed-out world built on an interesting set of fictional deities. I appreciate that the deities do not feel like fictionalized versions of ""real"" deities from world history. I like that their presence is felt indirectly by the characters, and the characters have to infer the whys and w"
5652,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"I enjoyed the dickens out of this novel. I thought this was post-Game of Thrones high fantasy, but looking at the publication date I guess it wasn't really. After the books, sure, but certainly not after the phenomenon of the show. So I suppose the overlap is coincidence or I don't really know. Anyway, I do like this new brand of politically aware low-magic fantasy. This is a take on GoT fantasy that's more...I don't like to say more feminine, but certainly more concerned with women and women's i"
5654,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"What a book. Stellar writing. The thing that I love most about the book is that even though it's secondary world fantasy even though its epic fantasy the stakes aren't the world. The stakes are a single family, a single kingdom, and you don't even find out those are the stakes until half way through the book. But it remains interesting because every character has a history, every character has a story, and bubbling underneath the surface is a deep theological debate which you can choose to study"
5655,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"I finished this last week but it's taken me a while to write a review as I wasn't sure how I wanted to rate it. Initially I thought it was a solid 4 star, but then I got to the ending and that was pretty awesome, so then I was thinking 5 star, but then I remember that for a lot of it I was hovering around 4, so I settled at a 4.5 star and rounded up, hence my 5 star rating. For me the beginning started out a bit slower than I'm used to and I think that for once I had the audio version on too fas"
5656,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"This 2001 novel by Lois McMaster Bujold won the Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Adult Literature. I read much more science fiction than fantasy, so this was definitely outside my usual box. The first thing that struck me about it was how much I liked the characters, especially Cazaril, the broken former soldier who stumbles into Valenda, looking for any kind of work, and how carefully the characters are built in the first half of the book. It is not until halfway through that anything at all fantas"
5657,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"I'm rounding up, in appreciation of Bujold's feat in dreaming up yet another terrific series, fully distinct from the two previous series I've so enjoyed (the Vorkosigan Saga and The Sharing Knife). I believe I would at least try any genre Bujold ventured into, even horror or porn. I've never before read a book whose worldbuilding included a new and apparently valid religion. That's an ambitious task, but Bujold pulls it off -- along with the society in which the Five Gods are worshipped (with a"

I really appreciated the individuality of the voices, especially the small touches like the page with the voice that cracks. The story itself was a lot of fun. I enjoyed the world building, the independence of the main female characters, and a lot of the little things (like Betriz being the initiator of most of the relationship with Caz). I did have some issues with the pacing. Particularly when I got 85% of the way through and realized that the"
5659,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"Richly imagined and immensely rewarding. This fantasy is everything you want a fantasy to be: detailed, fast-paced, with a convincing world and depth of imagination, and most rarely, vivid characters who leap off the page. There aren't enough ways to rave about Bujold's work here. I binged it in a day."
5661,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"More BOOKLOVE!!!! 😍😍😍 (Seriously, this year has been filled with excellent reads.) I should never write reviews right after finishing a book, because I'm at my most adoring and least impartial. But I really adored both this book and Paladin of Souls. The interactions of the characters with their religion & gods is one of my favorite parts, I think, though I love the plot & characters as well."
5662,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"Finally getting back to this series. I like the way Bujold examines religion in this series. Eager to get on to the others. The narrator took a little bit of getting used to, but he ended up working for me."
5663,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,Bujold for the win once again. It kept me constantly reaching for the book in every free moment. Captivating and interesting. I will try to find rest of the books from the series as I really enjoyed this one.
5664,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,3,"There's a lot to like about the book. The characters are very well done and kept me interested. But there was also a lot going on in this book and I confess not all of it interested me, personally. Going to continue on with the series though!"
5665,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"I don't read a ton of high fantasy, but my feelings on this were that the medieval intrigue was good, but it could have used a wizard or an ogre or something. Good vacation reading, though."
5666,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,3,"Very shallow, characters black and white, ending is predictable. How magic in this world works is not good enough described, so events are pretty much deus ex machina."

5673,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"Loved it loved it loved it. Could not put it down. Delightful story, delightful writing. Probably 4.75 stars rather than the full 5 because there were a few times the main character didn't act as smart the main character was written. But super enjoyable."
5674,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,"Well crafted. I was a little hesitant to start slogging through a big book at the end of vacation, but any slogging ended by page 2 or 3. Bujold can turn a phrase just right to infuse it with a delightful gentle humor. She's also good at deep theological discussion nestled in very interesting dialogue. Reminded me of Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn series or Tamora Pierce's Song of the Lioness."
5675,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,"Romance and intrigue Characters and worlds are so beautifully drawn, I never tire of this author. She also knows how to use the language, which is both a joy and a relief! My only complaint is that I’d like each book to be a 12+ book series!"
5676,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,2,"I love Lois McMaster Bujold. I love Miles Vorkosigan and her remarkable Space Operas. I don't feel at all the same about this. Supposedly I read this last year but I don't remember finishing it then. This, then, will be my second and last attempt to enjoy this series from an author I adore."
5677,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,Nominated for a World Fantasy award in 2002 The Curse of Chalion marked a shift for Bujold from the sci-fi adventure of Miles Vorkosigan to a more sedately paced fantasy novel. As commander of a border garrison Castillar Lupe de Cazaril held the fort against the enemy for longer then anyone expected. Peaceful negotiations prevailed and the fort was sold to the enemy. Unfortunately for Caz he was “mistakenly” left off the list of ransomed men and quickly sold into slavery on Rocknari galley. Retu

The movie was good (I am a fan of Hayo Miyazaki's films) and I wasn't disappointed in the book. As always much of the book wasn't put into the movie, but it was understandable because I imagine it would be hard to piece together a movie with all the components this story has. To really grasp and understand the book I would suggest that it be read twice I think. Since I did watch the movie I wasn't"

There was traffic almost the entire way, and I was jammed in the back in between two booster seats, which let me tell you – was not comfortable.

She leaves her dead-end job in the village and, for lack of a better option, moves herself (without bothering to a"

5694,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,"Howl’s Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones opens in a picturesque little village, in a country and a world where magic—gifts and curses, fairies and witches—are not just real, but taken for granted. The people around them manage to have almost tediously normal lives. Our protagonist, Sophie Hatter, is the eldest of three sisters, so she knows her youngest sister will have luck and adventure while she herself will have a dull and obscure existence, probably as an old maid tending her father’s hat s"
5695,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,"Howl's lingers with me because of the humor, because of the perfectly executed twisting plot, because of the snapping dialog. Diana is possibly the best writer of her generation but because she wrote mainly YA in a time before HP she was disregarded. You want to know what I think a book should be like? Read this one."
5696,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,"I'd started writing this review yesterday. I had to quit because I was busy having one of my anxiety fits about using cliches, not saying what I really mean, unclear sentences, my bad grammar, blah blah. I worry about it so much that it is hard to write anything. Howl's Moving Castle is one of those books that I wish I'd not read so I could read it again. That's a cliche, it's true, but it is true. A lot has been written about Howl's on goodreads so I'll try and say something beyond all of the t"
5698,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,"So what is Howl's Moving Castle ? Pull up a stool by the fire and I'll tell you. Deceptively complex and yet magically simple, Diana Wynne Jones' inimitable classic throws everything but the kitchen sink (well, probably that too) and gobs of green goo upon the concept of the fairy tale and dusts it with a generous helping of humor, horror, and heart. From making Sophie into an old woman, to making glowing faces in the fireplace, to Wales being a home as deep and dynamic as DiCaprio's own final dest"

I found it boring, the characters are meh and tbh how Wynne Jones draws out a storyline over 200 pages when they could cover 100 is completely pointless, and did I mention, boring. I was interested in the introduction of Sophie and her sisters, but then the Witch of the Waste turns Sophie into a 90-year old lady and it just becomes boring.

5714,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,"I talk about this book in this video wrap-up . This was my first read of 2016, and it was a lovely and enchanting way to start my reading year. Howl's Moving Castle is so much of what I love in books: whimsy, a vivid setting, bright characters and found families. Wynne Jones' is told in such a clean and straightforward way that it makes the fantastical elements and setting stand out all the more. In turn, the brightness of those elements really help to balance and at times highlight the darker ele"

It reminded me a lot of Neil Gaiman's Stardust (although I did not like that one nearly as much). The character of Sophie Hatter was well done - I liked her wit and her ""take no prisioners"" attitude. The supporting case was also good. I particularly liked Calcifier and his interactions with Sophie. As to Howl himself, there was no doubt in my mind his ""true self"" and I knew from the start where the tal"

Also the romance could\should have been handled better. It kinda went something like: Howl: Hello, old lady. Sophie: Hello, famous wizard. *accusingly* You like young ladies, do you not? Howl: Why yes, they are quite nice. You, however, are quite old. Clean my magical moving castle for me? Sophie: Why not. You need to change me back into a young lady again anyway"

It's whimsical and lovely and strange and wonderful and I never wanted it to end. The plot meanders just like the titular moving castle, but I LOVED it for that. You're not reading for plot, you're reading for the characters. There's just enough plot to keep things from ever being boring, but not so much that it overshadows the wonderful characters that inhabit this world. Jones writing is wonderful. This is the kind o"

And I can still thank her for becoming the well known and loved writer she apparently was.

The writing style was difficult for me to get caught up in, and I kept waiting for something enchanting and thrilling to happen. Unfortunately, after chapter 3, nothing did. At all. While I appreciated some aspects of Wynne Jones fantasy building (the castle and it's doorway portals in particular), I don't see where she executed these ideas in any kind of sustained imaginative way. Apart from Howl (w"
5730,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,3,"This was a very fun, charming story. It really seems so simply written, yet read more than one line and you are a part of the action, not just watching it. I really enjoyed Sophie, and feel like she is very human -- prone to snap judgments and bad decisions and she tends to underestimate herself. Howl is a very fun character, a bit of a ""player"" until his heart is stolen (literally). I would like to check out the other books in the series, but this one does stand alone quite nicely. :)"
5731,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,"It's been a long while since I read this, but I remembered absolutely loving it. My memories were correct. In fact, I read every book by Diana Wynne Jones I could get my hands on growing up. I've finally gotten a chance to reread this, and I'm glad I choose the audiobook format. Jenny Sterlin was brilliant. She utilizes her voice distinctly for the varied characters. She even makes a distinction between Old Sophie and New Sophie very well. I recommend listening to the audio if you have a chance."

Howl's Moving Castle is probably the single most popular piece of children's fantasy, right after Harry Potter of course. I've heard endless praise for this series ever since it was first released but, for some reason or the other, I was never drawn to it. It seemed charming, but not much else.

5739,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,"I don’t know how many times I’ve read this now, but it’s probably my favourite of Diana Wynne Jones’ work. I actually saw the Studio Ghibli adaptation first: it’s very different in some ways, but it still captures some of the ideas and tone. The thing I really loved, though, coming to the book after the film, was discovering all the Welsh background. The ‘saucepan song’, Howl’s family, his Welsh Rugby shirt, even some of the things he says — “there’s a welcome in the valleys”! As well as the Wel"

Edit 03.12.15 - So I took away a star because I'm a horrible person.

5741,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,"I think one of the main thing’s I love about Diana Wynne Jones’ novels is their ability to tell somewhat simplistic stories whilst integrating complex, labyrinthine plots involving fantasy and magic while being tinged with grains of realism without losing that feel of being in a whole other world.

The same goes for books who are considered"

I picked this book up on a whim from the discount bin in my local used bookstore. I loved the Hayao Miyazaki movie (but was mostly confused by it) because of its visuals.

Will explain, but I was reading this because Naemin wanted a reading partner. ended up reading the entire book almost in one sitting. Actual Review: Hiya Guys- Welcome to the Nether!

5786,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,4,"Last week I finally watched the anime version of this book. This is a book that I had read long ago around the ages of twelve to fourteen and enjoyed very much at the time. Like the anime film (my first venture into Studio Ghibli films) it was a strange and wonderful adventure like all the best fantasy novels of my childhood. The plot should be familiar to anyone who was seen the film or read any type of fairytale. It features a witch cursing a young woman, Sophie, transforming her into an elderl"
5789,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,"This brilliant and dazzling fantasy novel was the inspiration for the anime Studio Ghibli film by the same name. Howl's Moving Castle has everything from sorcery to friendship to adventure to imaginary kingdoms. When the main character finds herself under a spell that turns her into an old woman, the only thing she can think of is having the dreadful magic reversed. She soon finds though that appearances aren't everything and that her newfound friends are more important to her than she initially"
5790,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,"This is my second time reading this. I'd been listening to the audio book for five, six days and I finished yesterday. IT WAS DELIGHTFUL. My heart is so full right now with love for this book. I loved the narrator and her impersonations of different characters. I had forgotten so much it's been 5 years since I last read it. Howl is BEFORE ANYONE ELSE. LOOK AT HIM. And of course, the infamous green slime. Tee Hee. This was one of the best experiences of my life. I had such a wonderful time!"
5791,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,"EDIT: March 26, 2011. Rest in peace, Ms. Jones. The world has lost a wonderful author today. Review: Can I give this book six stars? How about ten? Twenty? No? Well, darn. I finally read this book after watching the Miyazaki movie for the second time, and I love them both, no matter how different they are. (It bears mentioning that the fact that it's impossible to get the face of movie Howl out of my head is probably part of this.) Seriously, though. Day after I watched the movie for the second time, I"

'I break my neck to get here, and I find you peacefully tidying up!' - the OTP in a sentence WTF, HOW ARE THEY SO PRECIOUS. FEELS OVERLOAD. Totally my kind of book with the setting, the magic, the world-building, the ship, the endless humor and the salt squad alskfjgdh. I loved how different it is from the movie because I'm a fan of both but especially the book since Sophie and Howl are less nice and noble, much more dramatic (can't decide between Howl with a cold or"
5794,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,4,"I fell in love with the anime movie adaptation, and still like it much better than the book. But that isn’t to say the book isn’t entirely special in its own right, and I think if I had read the book first, I probably would have liked it even more. It’s funny and swift, with tremendously flawed characters who somehow still dance that line of utter likability. Didn’t really go for Howl coming from Wales, but otherwise the fantasy world and magic system is quirky and delightful."
5795,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,2,"This didn’t wow me like I expected it to, and compared to my friends and many other people’s adoration, it’s obvious that in this instance, it’s a situation that clearly says “it’s me, not you”. Overall, this is for readers who are nostalgic for fairy tales that are full of mischief and magic, curses and conquering evil, and fulfilling one’s destiny. Best wishes that you enjoy it more than I did."
5796,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,4,"Well that was magicly adorable :D I have a very strong ghibli vibe with this book because of the movie. Ive seen it years ago and I cant wait to rewatch it soon :) Cute characters , sometimes dragged for me but still it had its magic. Loved how it played out :)"
5797,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,this book is very good and possibly better than the movie. it is now one of my favorites. if you have seen the movie than you should definitely read the book.

5799,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,3,3.5 Stars Very creative. Certain concepts were innovative. This book clearly influenced JK Rowling. I enjoyed it in the beginning but got bored half way through.

Now I finally read it and loved it! It was a great experience. As I always do, let's count good things about this book: 1. Characters! I loved every one of them (except Witch of waste obviously ). Main leads were fantastic! Sophie was somehow insecure about herself but also kind, bossy, strong minded girl. I liked her sarcastic comments. Her annoying grandma like talk was a"
5802,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,"I've read this maybe a dozen times, but not in the last decade or so. Yesterday, the boy watched the first half of the movie (which I have never actually seen) and had questions about how it differs from the book, which he knows I love, so we decided to make it our latest readaloud. We've read 5 chapters in two train rides (I pity all the other commuters, tantalized with hints but not getting the whole book), and I snuck another five chapters in bed last night. I stand in awe, as always, at the"
5803,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,"I'll admit that I read this book after watching the movie and I love them both, though they are both very different. I own the book, now all I have to do it find the movie. The first time I read this book I was confused at a few parts but the second time around I got it which let me appreciate the book even more. It was fun to be able to look for the hints all along the way. Sophie is turned into an old woman by the witch of the waste. This sets Sophie on her journey and finds herself being the"
5804,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,"This is probably one of Diana Wynne Jones' best books in my opinion and I love it up there with Dogsbody. Floating castles, talking fires, bouncing scarecrows? They could only be the wonderful creations of DWJ. I think what the author does best is create very real and very identifiable characters that somehow - you always feel you have always known. It's sort of magical how she does it, because many books may spend a few chapters establishing characters. With DWJ they just pop out at you straight"
5805,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,"I honestly couldn’t have enjoyed this book more! I really love middle grade fantasy fiction, especially when it’s as well done as this story was. It captured my attention right from the beginning and didn’t let it go until the very end. There are quite a few characters for such a small book but they are each so well developed that you can’t help but fall in love and care about each of them. Especially Howl, I just adore his character. He’s such an ass but that’s part of his charm for me! My favou"
5806,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,3,"Well, that was certainly interesting, in a sort of old school fairy tale type of way. I enjoyed it, but I also wanted it to be more clearly narrated. It got sort of muddled at times. All in all, though, a quick and entertaining read. 3.5 stars. ************************** This book is also on sale for Kindle for only $3.99. *sigh* So many books, so very, very little time.

5808,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,4,"This book is a delicious blend of magic and utter weirdness, something I am a huge fan of. I just love the Anime film of Howls moving castle, and I was curious to see if I enjoyed the book as much. They were both rather different. The characters in the book are more raw, and there is plenty of humour, which made it all the more enjoyable. This is a very quirky and unique fantasy book, and the author is a master at what she does. I'd love to have a ride in ""Howls moving castle""!!"
5809,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,"SO PERFECT AND AMAZING. I've been in love with the movie since I was a little girl and reading the book has made me love everything about it so much more. While the book and movie are completely different in many aspects, they're both so brilliant and magical and perfect. I can't even put my excitement at finally reading this book into words. It was everything I wanted it to be and more. I still adore the movie, but I can also add the book to my list of loves!!"
5810,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,"This is one of my most often-reread books - it's a perfect fantasy novel, a perfect love story and a perfect twist on fairytale norms. Diana Wynne Jones makes every one of her characters believably nuanced, funny and flawed. And I'm still totally in love with Howl. 12+ *Please note: this review is meant as a recommendation only. Please do not use it in any marketing material, online or in print, without asking permission from me first. Thank you!*"
5811,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,4,"Aww... I mean, just aww. This book is so cute and fluffy, there're no words to describe how much I enjoyed it. And because my philosophy is Books before Movies, I watched the movie just after finishing it, so I can say the level of awwness is off the charts. Just *____*"
5812,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,I enjoyed this book about a girl named Sophie who is turned into an old woman by the Witch of the Waste and encounters the Wizard Howl and works for him as his maid in his moving castle. I read this book after I saw the animated film directed by Hyao Miyazaki which is a pretty great movie and the book is a pretty good read. Definitely check out both the film and the movie.
5816,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,"So where shall I start - shall I say that I loved the film and had to read the book, Shall I start with the fact I have know of Diana Wynne Jones for years and never got round to reading her work or shall I start with the fact that this book has been on my TBR list for far too long and I finally decided to do something about it - or just admit to all 3.

Discovery and why I read it Stumbled upon it on the internet while ordering other books. Since I enjoyed the movie, I sort of spontaneous wanted to read the book, hoping it would be just as entertaining. Expectations I mostly expected a book with great characters and lots of magic. That definitely came true. The characters are great, especially Howl, and there was magic on every page. Characters Howl stole my he"

She goes on to work for the Wizard Howl, who is said to eat young girls' souls. This has got to be one of the most entertaining books I've read.

5821,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,4,"This is lighthearted and just lots of fun - the author said she got the idea from a boy at a school she was visiting, who asked her to write about a moving castle. In addition to the constant moving and rotating, the castle boasts a color-coded doorknob. By turning the knob to a different color before you open the door, you step out in a different location - traveling made easy! But of course all is not sweetness and light.

5824,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,4,"Diana Wynne-Jones has always been the master of quirky, unique fantasy, and I've found the best of these (especially the Chrestomanci books, which I adore) include travel between worlds. This is no exception, my only dislikes are that at some points it becomes a little confusing; and also the fact that I waited so long to read it!"
5825,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,"Having watched Miyazaki's film before reading this and finding it a masterpiece of beauty and complex story, I am truly surprised to find I enjoyed the novel just as much.

5827,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,4,"Re-read review: Rating: 3.5/5 I've never properly finished a re-read before but it was as delightful, if not as enjoyable as the first time. One thing that stood out to me during this re-read was that the book started off with a pretty simple and solid plot but got a bit messy after more plot points were introduced. I don't feel like they made the story stronger either and wish a bit more time was spent with the last few chapters in terms of Sophie and Howl. I think that's one thing the film did"

Everyone kept telling me I had to watch it and that it was the greatest Ghibi movie, but once I did I found that it was my least favorite. Not that the book has particularly changed it's standing film-wise, but the book was a million times better. I'm literally so happy that I got around to reading this. The movie poked so many holes into the plot and really down-played Howl's character, and mad"
5831,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,"This is definitely one of those books that I enjoy more and more every time I read it. I always have a memory of how rushed the ending is, and I still think it’s pretty rushed, but I think I understood the book quite a bit more this time. The book builds to a climax, but the actual final battle barely seems to take up many pages and then we have a few pages to wrap up all the plots, via the narrator pointing out various things the audience didn’t know yet. The complexity of Jones’s writing is on"
5832,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,"Let me get this out the way first: THIS BOOK IS FRICKING AWESOME! Omg, I have no words to convey how much I loved it! This is the first book in a long time where I actually didn't check how long the length of each chapters were, and I was actually so engrossed in the story that I kept reading on and on and didn't want to stop. To tell you how bad it got my friend sent me a text asking me to hang out and my first thought was ""NOOOO! I want to finish Howl's Moving Castle!!!"" Yes, it's that good pe"
5833,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,3,"It was okay, not great. I watched the movie for the first time about a year ago and don't remember a ton, so I wasn't comparing the book to the movie as I read, thankfully. My main issue with it is that it wasn't terribly immersive. The characters just flitted about from one problem/event to the next and it all seemed random and unimportant. I do remember that my impression of the movie was that it lacked a cohesive plot, and I found the same with the book. I found myself frequently having to re"
5835,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,"After checking out the other editions of this book, I've discovered that my volume has either the second or the third ugliest cover out there. Well, no matter. Don't judge a book by the dude on the cover and all that. Sophie lives in a fairy tale world - that's very exciting for us readers, of course, but possibly less exciting for people like herself, who have a stepmother, two younger sisters and a tendency to say the wrong thing to evil witches. The last unfortunate tendency, alas, gets her cu"
5836,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,"One of my favorite books of all time--I am not really rational about it. What I love: Sophie's crotchety behavior, and her handiness with weedkiller; Howl's vanity, which keeps him from being a fairy tale hero and makes him a gazillion times more interesting than one; the clever twists on fairy tale tropes; everything about Calcifer; and, of course, the green slime. The ending is perfect despite coming together in quite a rush, and the entire plot has an admirable crazy logic. Side note: The boo"
5837,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,4,I had seen the movie version of this many many years ago and wow this could not be more different. They definitely both have merit but I have to say that I think the book is much more complicated and the characters are more nuanced. I really love her writing style because she takes all of these very fantastical elements but writes about them in such a matter-of-fact way that you're sitting there like 'oh well OBVIOUSLY'. It reminds me a lot of Neil Gaiman so I think that people who enjoy his boo
5838,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,"This was delightful. I don't know why it took me so long to read it considering that I'm a HUGE Miyazaki fan and I've refused to watch this movie because I had yet to read the book. I found the story quite original, even when it had subtle references to other fairy tales and children's books. I loved the characters, the setting... well, I loved it!"
5839,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,4,"Fantastic. Utterly fun, entertaining and magical! Such a fun read. I found this book after watching Hayao Miyazaki's masterpiece. I had been warned this would be different from the movie but I am glad I went ahead and read it. It was really great! I loved it and I highly recommend it to anyone who saw the movie and wanted to know more about Howl and Sophie."
5840,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,2,"2.5 stars. Good, solid young adult fantasy story though I was hoping to like it more than I actually did. I listened to the audio version and the narrator did a decent job. This would be a good one to read with your kids."
5841,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,3,"3.5-4 stars. I quite liked that! Lots of loveable characters and fun banter and a relatively fast-paced storyline. I see how so many people like it, especially children^^ But one is never too old for fairytales, right?"
5842,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,3,"Witches and curses. Roving buildings and mysterious doors. A wizard who smells of apple blossoms. Smoke billows, bones creak, fire crackles. The magic in Howl's Moving Castle draws the reader in, but it's the poetic effect of Diana Wynne Jones' writing that keeps the pages turning."

So after watching the movie again recently I decided it was high time to read about one of my favourite wizards. It was so much better than the movie. Which obviously I still love, but all of the characters are so well developed in the book! Especially Howl. I was so happy that the slime scene was in this as it’s one of my favourite scenes from the movie. I also enj"

I love Sophie and her ability to absolutely terrify people by aggressively cleaning things, and Howl's slithering-out-ness, and the humorous takes on fantasy expectations and tropes. It's classic, but it's also surprising! There were so many things I didn't expect to happen, and a point near the end when I had no idea how it was all going to tie together until it did.

And now, after finding a fanfic that's a crossover between TW and this universe (let us ponder the potential awesomeness of that for a second), I wanted to refresh my memory and picked it back up expecting a delightful ride once more.

5861,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,4,When I found that this book was from the movie I was super excited! I loved what Studio Ghibli did with the movie but I think the book was better. I think it's pretty funny when Sophie (main character) turns into a granny. Usually books don't have young people turning into old people by a witch. The characters were easy going and fun to read. But there's Howl. He's overly concerned with his appearance and makes multiple potions to look handsome. I wished Howl wasn't that way but that's how the a

5863,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,4,"Enjoyable, but very chaotic. I don’t like stories where important information is hidden from the reader, without any clue to untangle the lines. You are kept in darkness all along, only to be flooded with everything on the last couple of pages. The romance between Sophie and Howl is out of the blue, there is no hint for that till suddenly it is just there. Anyway, the story is adventurous, full of magic, humor, and mystery. I loved Calcifer and Michael."

5867,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,"I finally saw Howl's Moving Castle for the first time this summer, and I was instantly obsessed. So I was very excited to read this book. Like the movie, the main characters are Howl, Sophie and Calcifer. And they are in a ""castle"" that moves. Beyond that... Miyazaki did his own damn thing with that movie and its plot. I kept waiting for certain things to happen in this book as they did in the film, but they never did. Even some characters were completely different where one was a ""good guy"" in"

I originally read this book back in the fall of 2009. I liked it, thought it was pretty cute, but it wasn't my favorite read of the year or anything.

It was the face of a gaunt old woman, withered and brownish, surrounded by wispy white hair. Her own eyes, yellow and watery, stared out at her, looking rather tragic. “Don’t worry, old thing,” Sophie said to the face. “You look quite healthy.

I know this is going to be a very unpopular review, since all my friends that have read this have given this 5 stars.

So, Howl's Moving Castle follows Sophie, a young girl who is burdened with very little prospect"
5881,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,3,"Howl’s gave us a lot of mixed feelings. A few of us really enjoyed the book, but others were left barely able to get through the first few chapters. So let’s break it down... Howl’s was a cute, fast, fun, imaginative, and charming read for those who finished. The concept was original but the story itself was fairly unpredictable. The castle was GENIUS, who wouldn’t want to move and a door that opened to different places at the turn of a knob? About dem characters... Howl and Calcifer were our favor"
5883,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,4,"This was a delightful and fun book from Diana Wynne Jones--probably geared more toward children than adults, but enjoyable nevertheless. Sophie was an unusual, but likeable character. She seemed to take being turned into an old woman in stride and indeed fell into the role quite readily. Her interactions with the wizard, Howl, were hilarious at times. Howl himself was vain, self-absorbed and lovestruck, but managed to endear himself to me anyway. He was definitely not the stereotypical wizard by"

5886,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,2,"A classic in the fantasy field, this is best suited for readers looking for the traditional orphan-identity quest. While I enjoyed it overall, I was able to set the book down and walk away, coming and going from the story until Simon reached the woods. I consider it a bad sign when I'm able to set a book down--my favorites have me locked into reading position until I reach the end page. Eventually it picked up and reeled me in, but there was skimming involved. A combination coming-of-age and cas"
5887,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"The opening to what is easily the best fantasy series I've ever read. Williams' Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn remains, IMHO, one of the most underread and underappreciated series out there. I suspect that the length of the novels scares some people off; Dragonbone Chair is the shortest, and it's still around 700 pages. The series as a whole incorporates most classical fantasy elements: an epic quest, dark sorcery, an unlikely hero, etc., but what makes it unforgettable for me is one main thing. Will"
5888,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"One of the seminal works of epic fantasy which, along with the works of Robert Jordan and David Eddings, made the genre what it is today. Williams makes a virtue of starting small as we follow orphaned kitchen boy Simeon through his childhood in the castle of King Prester John. However, the king's death heralds an age of discord and Simeon finds himself drawn into valiant Prince Josua's rebellion against his increasingly despotic and magically deranged brother. The scope of the story expands wit"
5889,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,"“Books are a form of magic because they span time and distance more surely than any spell and charm.” The Dragonbone Chair is the first book in Tad Williams’ Memory, Sorrow and Thorn series and an amazing coming of age story, which probably had big enough impact to shape and influence many of today’s popular writers of this genre. For that alone, it is my opinion, that it should be visited at least once in a lifetime, no matter of someone’s preference in their genres. A truly magnificent wor"
5890,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,My very useful and coherent review:
5891,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,"I came into this book a little forewarned by the good readers here at Goodreads: ""that this book is a SLOW buildup"". 0-20%, slow. 20-30%, something could happen, are we leaving yet? 30-35%, is this it? No, false start. 35-45% OK, we left the castle, something has to happen right? 45%-end: Bam! Fires, dragons, magic swords, trolls, elves, demons, mountains, crossing the map, wolves (good and bad), bad dreams/good dreams, death, sieges, magical storms, ships....... The slow build-up eventually drop"
5892,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"Truly a masterpiece and probably my favorite Fantasy book of all time. The rest of the series is pretty awesome as well. Also, the most evil villain bar none of any Fantasy series I've ever read in Pryrates the evil priest. If you haven't read Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn in its entirety, you really must. This is what made me a Tad Williams fan for life."
5893,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"Dear Tad Williams, I cannot thank you enough for writing a book...well, set of books...that I can read as a full-on grown-up and still enjoy as much as I did when I was an angsty teenager. It has been hurtful to find so many of my favorite when-I-was-young reads (looking at you, Shannara and DragonLance) aren't actually good at all and that I must adore them from afar with only sentimentality stoking the fires of young love. Thank you for not adding to that hurt. I appreciate the effort you put int"

I immediately said yes, for four reasons: Tad Williams was a new author for me, one I’d been curious about every since the 1998 publication of City of Golden Shadow, Book I in his Otherland ser"
5895,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"Great, great epic fantasy! I don’t know why I postponed it for so long. Good thing I have the right friends here to open my eyes. If you loved LOTR story, you’ll love this one too. It’s the story of a great quest, friendship transcending all barriers, brave companions in their struggle to save the world. Simon, a kitchen boy is caught in a series of events which are beyond his comprehension. Fleeing for his life, he makes some unusual friends along the way. Even if the story unfolds quite slowly,"
5896,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,2,"2.5* The writing style is very good. However the pacing is super slow. If you're going to have a slow pace, for me, you have to balance it with some sort of engaging psychological gauging of the characters usually with a high dose of empathy or some type of theoretical discussion which is thought provoking or some witty character banter. I think if you like old school fantasy and it's pacing you'll love this. If you don't then not so much."
5897,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"I was 14 years old when I first read this book. I remember feeling like a boss when I turned that last page. I had done it. I had finished this monster of a book all on my own and all without anyone telling me I had to. Not only that but I really, really loved doing it too. I wasn't a complete newb to SF/F - I had the Narnia books read to me, as well as The Hobbit, Lord Of The Rings, and A Wrinkle in Time . And while I loved those books - I had to share them with my family. I had to discover thos"
5898,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,1,O what a ponderous tome! I've been wanting to read this book for a long time and was sorely disappointed. Tropes aside this book is so long winded and dull I could barely get through it! I almost gave up on it a few times. The only thing that saved me is that every hundred pages or so something truly interesting would happen and then right back to boring ol' Simon and his boring bullshit! One of the biggest problems with this book was it's scope. The cast of characters was too long and Mr. Willia
5899,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"Here's what went down, in case you're interested. I read ""The Old Scale Game"", a short story by Tad Williams off Unfettered , and I was like ""Oi! I like this shit!"". I enjoyed it so much, I ran to the local used book-store and got myself a copy of ""The Dragonbone Chair"". And loved the muthafucken' poo out of it, hey! Mind you, there's nothing original about this novel, it's a pretty cliched story, but I guess it was just what I needed to read: old-fashioned high fantasy, that is, Young-scullion-s"
5900,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"This is one of my all-time favorite series and I reread it almost every year. That being said, I can understand why many people have given it negative reviews. There are two things that are cited most often 1) the slow start and 2)that there is nothing new (no new magic system, cultures are copies of Earth cultures, main character follows scullion to hero story, etc.), and I want to briefly address both those concerns before giving my final recommendation. Whenever I recommend this series to som"
5901,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,"I have to be honest, I love Tad Williams. A lot of my friends aren't fans of his because he really does take ages and ages to get to the point. He's very big on character development, which is basically all I read books for. I not only forgive three hundred pages of character introduction and exposition and plot set-up, I gleefully embrace it. This book isn't any different from others of his that I've read in that respect, and in all others, it's a classic fantasy adventure. Orphan boy tapped for"
5902,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,"Oh, the orphan boy with unknown talents, who under-performs until the pressure is applied—how many fantasy stories have you read with this structure? Let’s see-- Magic’s Pawn by Mercedes Lackey, The Riftwar Saga by Raymond Feist, The Belgariad by David Eddings, The Sword of Shannara by Terry Brooks, even to some extent The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings by Tolkien (substitute “hobbit” for “boy”). Maybe even the King Arthur story to some extent—until young Arthur pulls the sword from the stone."
5903,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,1,"My introduction to Tad Williams was the Otherland quartet, which rank among the very best books I ever read. Otherland had strong characters, an engaging plot, and a fast-paced movielike quality about it. I expected the same from other Williams works, so I picked up The Dragonbone Chair for some summer vacation reading. And I was incredibly disappointed. The utter lack of engaging dialog and prevalence of weak, forgettable characters ruins this book. I found myself flipping past 2-3 pages at a ti"
5905,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,"This is the second series I have started by Tad Willaims and this is a purely fantasy-based one rather than the blend which was Otherland. I went into this not long after having finished Otherland becuase I really enjoyed that series and I was hoping to enjoy this one just as much. Once again, I feel as though this is a series with potential, but as yet it's not reached that potential and so I will certainly continue onto book 2, but as of right now Otherland intrigued me more by this point.

5906,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"I love this series. I hadn't thought of it in a little while, but speaking about books today with a friend brought it to mind and I thought, ""I haven't read that this year...I should."" The four LARGE volumes are quite an investment, both in money and in time, (get it from the library, or let me know and you can borrow mine when I'm done) but it's worth it in the end. I know that sci-fi/fantasy are seriously formulaic, and these are not that different...young boy, thrown into circumstances beyond"
5907,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,"What a fantastic story. Some people can't stand special snowflake Simon, but I love it all. The Dragonbone Chair is takes a long time to build, and therefore it's hard to give a spoiler free premise. Our main character is Simon, a young orphan boy living in the Hayholt castle. He is a dreamer, someone unfit for the dreary castle life. When he becomes the apprentice of the fascinating Morgenes, he feels like he might finally become part of the adventures and grand life he has always fantasized abo"
5909,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"Out of the older tradition of fantasy writing, this one takes its time and builds slowly, carefully, meticulously, until we have a world and conflict that feels real and surprising in the present with the depth that a long history provides. Really good stuff if you're patient enough to let it simmer. I will admit to being bored at times, and frustrated with Simon's ignorance and naivete, especially in this first book. What I would consider to be the introduction takes about 200 pages. Then it's"
5910,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,"About 15 years ago, when I was a wan, neurotic preteen wandering in the suburban wasteland of Southern California, my daily afterschool routine would lead me to the local library: a smallish building tucked under the overhanging boughs of a massive oak, it had a more visible neighbor in the even tinier city hall. In my later life, I would grow to realize that the entire complex, from library to city hall to the grocery store and mom-and-pop joints, were one of the last remnants of the ""old towne"
5911,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,"This is my first work from Tad Williams, but it definitely won't be my last. This is a novel in the high fantasy tradition. It's a tale that spans a continent, with a quest of dire consequence, and rife with complex in-depth cultures and characters. The Dragonbone Chair takes obvious influence from J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, most specifically in tone and scope. Though it is FAR from a rip-off in anyway. The story is completely original. I also believe Tolkien to be only one of many"
5912,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"4.5 stars, deservedly rounded up to 5 stars for the overall enjoyment of this first book in the ""Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn"" series. A slow start and one or two sections in which I was lulled into near boredom (hence the missing half star in the rating), but beyond that a great adventure filled with interesting, well developed characters; colorfully descriptive and imaginative places and things...and plenty of action and intrigue once the story gets going. The author's careful attention to painti"
5913,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"I enjoyed every word, I enjoyed nature of Osten Ard. It's so unlike Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance, Diskworld and Shadow of a Dark Queen, less colorful, but not less wonderful. All point-of-views were engaging and not-cringe-worthy. I found first half of book more interesting than some later parts, but loved part featuring Jiriki, Ice Dragon, Joshua's escape from Naglimund, Simon's dreams, I LOVED Simon's dreams and Miriamele."
5914,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"I really enjoyed this book once I concentrated on it. Williams isn't really breaking any new ground in fantasy with it, but it's well-written and well-imagined."
5916,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"++Spoilers++ (not really a review, but more or less notes to myself) Some may not care for this book or get bored with it. I did not. If you liked LOTR you will like this. Yes it could have been shorter, yes it could have been more action packed, but It is not that kind of a read. Considering my mood of late, this was exactly what I was looking for, a nice long detailed story that makes me feel as though I was going on the journey with the characters. A nice fantasy comfort read, and I loved it. I re"
5917,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,"This is a reread for me, preparatory to reading the new series and The Heart of What Was Lost. I was pretty excited to plunge back in, because I remember being spellbound by it, and I gave it a solid four stars. I thought I remembered it pretty well, and remembered that I’d found it fairly typical in terms of the plot, but now some things did somehow surprise me, and I’d glossed over great chunks of the plot in mind. Which is fine, because rediscovery is great. It is very much an epic in the mode"

I'm so happy I had that weird furniture card in my uno reading challenge because I found some really good books! I loved the world that this book brought me into.

IT'S FUCKING AMAZING I don't think I've ever been engrossed in a fantasy book like this before but I'm getting ahead of myself again and should start from the beginning. It all started last year when I decided to surf through different books on my phone choosing what to read and reading samples of book I found interesting and one of those books was this. After reading the blurb and finding out it is a classic story of a kitchen scullion who l

I felt there were too many long drawn out sections, too much description and songs, and not enough plot advancement. I liked it, but it's very much a rip off of Tolkien. A special snowflake orphaned common boy, finds out he's special and goes on a long journey/quest to save the world from the evil ancient shadow king accom"

5923,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,"Maybe a rip off straight from the main ideeas of J.R.R Tolkien, but let`s face it, Tad Williams has a good, strong, voice of his own. Until this volume ended, the main character doesn`t find out that his a special boy, he just consider itself to be a very common orphan, that gets to lives, from a fatidic day, the adventure of it`s life. The writing is smooth, easy to get into, yes, there are a lot of stories and songs, but on the other hand there aren`t too long, so they didn`t bother me a lot. An"
5924,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,"Actual rating: 4.5 stars I must confess that this series has been sitting on my bookshelf for a very long time now and I have somehow always skipped over it, partly due to its bulkiness and also partly because of so many discouraging reviews. Curiosity won over eventually and I gave it a try. From the beginning itself I didn’t really love it. The pace was extremely slow and practically nothing significant happened in the first half of the book. At times it felt like dragging. And the main hero Sim"
5925,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"My inner child rejoices. The older i grow the more I turn back...This tale came from my deepest dreams and wishes. A slow paced, yet greatly climacting epic story full of things I love. Great forests, tall snowclad mountains, ancient cities and ruins, vast labyrinthian keeps with mysterious caverns below. Dark magic and sorcerers, masters and their puppets, ancient evil, storms gathering, lots of winter and campfires in the night, Norsemen warriors, mysterious enigmatic elven ppl. So many things"

History and magic and strife and kingdoms. When I say dense, I do not misspeak. And that was hard, at first. So many names. So many details. I struggled, and almost put it down. But then, something happened. If you've read it, you know where the action starts. And it was so gripping and so well written, I never looked back. Soooo, yeah, if y"
5927,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,"I am a fan of dark fantasy so I has my doubts I would be able to finish this long book being traditional epic/high fantasy fare. The novel has a frustrating slow pace at times but there is enough adventure, within its 900+ pages, to fill a trilogy. I am surprised this book is not better known, I liked it A LOT."
5928,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"A story needs “hook” - an intangible quality that instantly appeals, the giddiness from a treat within reach. The Dragonbone Chair * failed to hook at first impression, whereupon it sat languishing on my shelf until a confluence of events tipped it into my favor. In good conscience, I cannot recommend this book to everyone. Time is too precious for investing into a 600+ page ** story with an unremarkable blurb that reads like vanilla bildungsroman, especially one that devours half the book in ex"

A lot of people have warned me that the beginning is a little slow, which I can see and understand. The first 200 pages or so are dedicated to establishing daily life and mainly introducing the more important characters of the novel. But the hardest part for me wasn't the slow beginning, but rather two specific sequences that forced me to make an effort in continuing readi"

This book is slow, almost painfully slow at first. There are a lot of characters and back story and events that mean nothing at first but turn out to be important later. Once you get past the slow part, the book is pretty good. Detailed, amazing world and I really felt drawn in with the charcters. I eagerly await my read of the next book"

In opening The Dragon Bone Chair, you step onto the threshold of one of fantasies grandest tales - and yet, a 5 star read it is not... quite.

It has an incredibly slow start -- and even after it gets going, the pacing is still often nothing to write home about. Not nearly as bad as Wheel of Time -- but I wasn't as interested in all the details as I was in Wheel of Time, either. I really didn't need to know all four verses of the various songs people were singing throughout, for instance. And unfortunately, I never did becom"

So of course this influenced my reading, and as I read, I evaluated each chapter against Tolkien. It was easy to do because I recognized so many of the same elements; many of them were the same ones Tolkien himself took from the Scandinavian mythology. There was a lot of T.H. White in there,too. I kept score in my head, tallying up fantasy elements in two columns. There was Merlin/Gandalf/Morgenes"

Two years later I took it with me on holiday, tried it again (I thankfully can jump in were I left of even after long periods of time), and put it down again.

5941,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,"At first this book seems like a very traditional fantasy. A kingdom in crisis. A young man of humble origins. A dark force on the horizon. A desperate quest. Shadowy fantasy races. They are all very stock tropes. But then you look at the date - its in the 80s. This series precedes the Wheel of Time, The Wars of Light and Shadow, Malazan, A Song of Ice and Fire - this puts a different perspective on things. The two strong points of this book are characterization and world-building. The world is a"

Having read a goodly chunk before lethargy set in, I was determined to keep reading (it is a fantasy classic, after all). I have never been so glad to finish a book in my life. My recent root canal was more fun than this in the end and only my personal brand of masochism kept me going. In the story, the old king, and uniter of a troubled land, dies and his sons don't like each other. Ancient baddies are lo"

I was wrong. While it didn’t have a lot of new plot or character elements, it did have good ones. I was also suprised to recognize the roots of several of my favourite fantasy novels. The first 150 pages were fairly lackadaisical, a meandering glimpse into the life of the young innocent main character – slow plot-wise. This book has a lot of"

It's one of those worlds where every time I return there, it's like a long-overdue catch-up with old, beloved friends. I love these characters, this world. I love the unique quality that arises from mixing fantasy staples with elements from history and myth and then throwing onto that canv"

Thinking back on this book, not a whole lot actually happened that required the page count. Yes, the step by step feel of the book gave it the ""epic"" feeling that it helped define in the genre but Simon just wasn't that interesting of a character to me.

5951,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,1,"I had high hopes for this novel, however sadly it came across as painfully clichéd maybe I just read too many fantasy books but it was one of those stories where a few chapters in I could already tell what was going to happen *sigh*. Let me put it this way, I bought this meaty-enough looking book to read on my daily hour-plus train commute because I get bored very quickly. Most of the time when I had this book as my only other option I was more inclined to just sit with my arms folded and stare"
5953,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,"Well, that was interesting. The Dragonbone Chair is a strong beginning to a fantasy story that is different than a lot of what you will find today. It is also a very traditional fantasy story, featuring tropes that are well beaten into the ground by now but were perhaps a bit less so in the late 1980s, when this book first came into being. The generational difference is what I found so fascinating. I like many books that I've read in recent years in the genre, but particularly within the realm of"
5954,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"I've become astonished at the number of people who complain that a 900-page novel, the first in a 2500-page trilogy, takes so long to get started. The verb I often use is ""stately."" The current vogue for stories that begin in media res is to blame for this,as well as the way that publishers have become conditioned to think that we need constant action and adventure to satisfy us. However, Mr Williams spends roughly 200 pages setting things up for us: we learn about the background to the story, w"
5956,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,"The Dragonbone chair was originally published in 1988, and i feel like an idiot for not having picked it up earlier. What a fantastic book! I listened to the Audible audio book version, and the narrator was just superb- he performed the text beautifully,and had a wonderful range of voices- from norsemen, to trolls, women and a certain 'special' teenage boy. Everything that the fantasy lover in me wanted, was delivered. I loved the slow build up, the world building, the hints at paranormal and Ma"
5957,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"**Update** July 2017 About five year have passed since I last read this book, and I have to say, I actually loved it more the third time. I am upping my review of this book to the 5-star level because there are so many great, classic story elements here that are woven into a story that is literally painted by the words that Tad William's uses in his prose. I will be diving into the next book very soon, and I cannot wait to read the two new books in this setting that have been resting on my shelf. D"

It's not difficult to say how I feel about this. I really enjoyed it and I'm pretty solidly invested in the characters. It's a very interesting book in a hundred different ways. Williams is doing amazing worldbuilding here, presenting an enormous world with fully realised civilisations and cultures, which I'm excited to see more of. I think the most interesting thing about the no"
5959,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,"Mixed feelings about this one. I'm not loving it but I do admit it certainly got better and better as it moved along to the end. 3 more books of 900 pages each so I'm thinking it might be something I really need to love to complete. It's rather old-fashioned Epic Fantasy. And it contains all the tired tropes and cliches of the sub-genre: reluctant-young-hero-coming-of-age, a-fool-main-character-that-allows-for-heavy-world-building-exposition, elves-are-so-lithe-and-magical-and-ever-so-precious ("

5961,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,This a re-read; I first read this when it came out and memory tells me it was my favorite series ever. It has been 20 or so years since I read it so thought I would re-read the whole series and see if it stood the test of time. This is a huge epic high fantasy in the true definition. Unlike other epic fantasy's - every single page matters and progresses the story - no matter how slow that section of the book is/was it is still adding to the story. I didn't remember how slow progressing the book was

I could not really say how many times, I have read this book, but this is probably the sixth or seventh time I have read Tads classic novel of fantasy, although this is actually my first re-read in several years. When re-reading an old favorite, there is always the trepidation of ""Will it be as good as I remember it to be?"". To answer my own question here, yes it it. And then some!

Yea, in today's world of dystopian fantasy it's a bit dated, it's still a great read. I have to concur with many others, it takes a long time to get going. But when it does, man what a great read.

5966,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"4.5 stars. Tad Williams novel is a classic example of an epic fantasy tale. Brother princes at war, a young hero pitched headlong into a journey, magic, mythical swords and a dragon – none of the elements of the story are unique, but the story is extraordinary in its scope and depth. The world of Osten Ard is incredibly well built, rich in detail and dripping with lore and history. If you love the epic fantasy that will keep you absorbed for days, then read these books. No grimdark, simply a bril"
5967,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,2,"I was recommended this after asking about any books that are as good as the A Song of Ice and Fire series or the Lord of the Rings trilogy and I wish the recommendation never came. I feel like the last three weeks were a waste. I consider myself a fast reader but with this one, I felt as if I really took my time. The story felt dragged on. The dialog was boring and not very gripping. I also wasn't very impressed with the characters but because the concept of the story appealed to me, I pushed on"
5968,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,"Tad Williams really did a great job on this series and this first book stands out. I'm very, very tempted to give it 5-stars but when I read it several years ago I thought it was a bit too YA for me at the time. Maybe when I read it again I'll think otherwise. Or perhaps it's just one you should read in high school. Either way, it's a good book and I do see myself reading the first volume of the series again at some point. I recommend you read it soon if you haven't."
5969,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"This is a gem in the genre of fantasy and is overlooked because it is older. Old school fantasy with great character building, description of the environment without the cheesy and prepubescent tone of most fantasy writing. I was interested in the story line, the way it was written, and the dark tone that came with it. Would recommend to the brahs out there."
5970,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,I was disappointed by this book. There were huge chunks of fairly boring filler that had no real bearing on the story itself. The book itself was in need of a good editing. I am a fan of Tad Williams but this fell short.
5971,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,Review to come when I've gathered my thoughts
5972,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,2,"There is a certain style to the fantasy books of an earlier era, a style that sets it apart from the grim fantasy that we've come to love through the works of GRRM, Abercrombie, Mark Lawrence etc. I've never been a fan of this style but I understand the fact that they are the product of their time and the taste that existed when they were written. The Dragonbone Chair is not a bad book, however, at least for me, it is not a good book either. GRRM has stated that this book inspired him to write a"
5973,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,"This review will not be particularly well structured but I want to highlight what I loved and what was challenging for me to work through. This was a weird read for me. This is clearly an older fantasy story, beautifully told and full of incredible descriptions. Yet, I struggled. The book is divided in three parts; the first is a 4* read, the second part was my worst nightmare. I could not focus on the chapter, I kept restarting chapters because I was not entirely following what was happening; t"

The audio is likely coming in advance of a new trilogy from Williams, a sequel to the [i]Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn[/i] trilogy that this book is the first in.

I first read this book when it came out in 1988 and had to re-read it again immediately upon finishing it. This book and indeed the whole series had a profound impact on my own style of writing. Just like the best and most enduring of love affairs, The Dragon Bone Chair begins a bit slowly, as the author establishes the background to the tale. However, once you are into it, thi"
5977,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,"Well, I tried to write this as positives and negatives, but the two were too intermingled to be separated. Style: On the whole, good writing, with some excusable mistakes and awkwardness (the one unexcusable writing mistake he does is have his main character use the word ""mooncalf"" two or three times every time he talks to himself. So sick of that word). He sounds like Tolkien, except a bit easier to digest. His descriptions really work usually, and sometimes strike me with their poetry. His songs"
5978,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"“Brave and foolish often live in the same cave.” Where has this book been all my life? Well, since it was published in 1988. So much better than many Lord of the Rings rip-offs. Epic fantasy in a quasi-European medieval setting (though the Sithi are as much Nipponese as elvish; and the name is unfortunately similar to the evil characters of Star Wars). Good world building, good character development, complex cast and motives and history and …. “Books are magic because they span time and distance"
5979,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,"The Dragonbone Chair is about the adventures of Simon, a servant in Hayholt Castle, who goes from simple scullion to reluctant hero over the course of this book, the first installment of the Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn series.

5980,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,"This is highly thought of by fantasy authors. Tamora Pierce rates it five stars on GoodReads and this was the series that inspired George RR Martin to try his hand at epic fantasy. This first volume of Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn consists of 766 pages of such tiny print I feared for my eyesight. It's the kind of book with maps up front and an appendix and glossary in the back, written in omniscient point of view, populated with elves, giants, dragons and trolls, and studded with songs and poems.

All the same, I found myself completely wrapped up in this book and in its sequels. The world-building is magnificent, the threat is unnerving, and supporting characters like Binabik, Jiriki, Josua, and Isgrimnur are engaging. It's been over ten years since I've read this series, yet I can"
5986,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,"Out of all of Williams books that I have read this one has not been the best. It got off slow - which I was expecting, I remember the 1st of the Otherland series was excrutiatingly slow, in part due to the introductions to the stories of the vast amount of characters involved in the story. The first of MS&T is also quite slow but not in the same way, unfortunately. Its just slow plain & simple. I don't find the characters (particularly Simon) nearly as interesting as the characters Willia"
5987,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,"The Dragonbone Chair by Tad Williams is the first of three books in the series Memory, Sorrow and Thorn. It's common for a lot of fantasy books to start off slow but this took forever for anything to start happening. I would split this book up into three parts.

In this book there is a long passage fairly early on that involves the main character making a long journey und"
5989,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,"A thoroughly enjoyable read with a deliberately paced build-up that, like the gentle clack-clack-clack of an old fashioned wooden roller coaster, lulls you into a contemplative mood before dropping you off a cliff. All the classic elements are here: a nefarious power behind the throne, a band of companions bound by honor and loyalty, castles, magic, and swords of great power. What keeps it interesting, though, is the protagonist. He may not always do the heroic thing, he may be filled with doubt"

The language is dense and descriptive and sometimes it seems to almost get in the way but it bothered me no more than reading Tolkien does.

I see in other reviews (here and elsewhere) people saying similarly--that Simon, the protagonist (or at least central focus), mirrored the way they looked at the world at a certain age. Even more so than other books in this or other genres, one might argue. It's in the way Simon looks at the world, the way he dreams of adventures and is both mature and im"

I enjoyed Simon's travels and learning about the land of Osten Ard but I got to say I wasn't engaged in the war that was happening between King Elias and Prince Josua. There wasn't enough explanation on why Elias wanted to capture and/or kill Josua. The only reason was because it was Josua's fault that Elias' wife had been killed. But Josua felt terrible about it and it bothers him everyday. Why would Elias"
6010,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"I picked this up after seeing it mentioned so often as the inspiration for great contemporary fantasy writers. I can see why! This is classic epic fantasy -- for better or, sometimes, for worse. The world building is wonderful, with magical descriptions, varied cultures and species, interesting cultural details, and gorgeous vistas. The characters are reasonably nuanced, the plotting among all the various kings and princes and lords (and a very small number of ladies) are complex and believable,"

Too long. This story could have been delivered with more impact in about 450 pages, instead of 700+. Long version: The bad. Too much teen angst and fitful dream"
6014,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"Tad Williams has crafted a richly detailed back story, full of character development, history, and settings with as strong a sense of character as Simon. Although the tale moves slowly, as many first volumes in a series do, the details set the stage for events to come later. There is a great deal of foreshadowing. There is a delicate balance between the sharing of history, and showing the challenges that the characters presently face; between the myths and legends that haunt people's mind, and th"
6015,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,"I really enjoyed this book and plan to continue with the next ASAP: the characters, dialogue, action, and plotting are all top notch; the setting is (if not terrifically unique, see below) well-realized; and while it starts off a bit slow (a common enough issue with epics) once it gets moving, it's very hard to put down. Williams' take on elves is a little different than most (though not drastically so) and dragons are treated with more respect, so to speak, than many similar settings (insofar as"

6017,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,"To me the three books that make up Memory, Sorrow and Thorn are one single extremely long novel. I will thus make a common review for the 'series' and say a few different things about each book in particular afterwards. THE SERIES: Tad Williams certainly is a very neat writer. The writing style is very accessible. These are the type of books that you can put down in the middle of a sentence and pick up a few days after and immediately pick up where you left off. This not being sufficient to make an"
6018,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,"This was another re-read. I'm on a mission to read all my past favorites and break them down from a writer's point of view and hopefully learn to write better by trying to figure out the magic. The beginning of this book weeds out the undetermined. It's so slow . There's a lot here meant to establish a foundation for later action and mystery, so while it's important to character arcs and world-building, it's dense. The info dumps of reading textual history are the worst. I can only imagine beta-re"
6019,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,"I just completed this book yesterday. I tried once before, but was thwarted but Williams' long winded style. I am glad I tried it again. Williams does a great job with character development in this book. Simon, the main character, starts out a careless child. He's not quite a brat but not exactly well mannered either. This book, while containing the beginnings of a world-destroying evil, is essentially about the development of Simon from boy to man. The plot development in this book, while slow,"

It has everything you'd look for in a classic quest fantasy. With the growing popularity of 'A Song of Ice and Fire', new readers may find a resemblance between the storytelling of the two series.

What intrigued me most was that his fantasy world has a version of the Catholic Church -- in his books, Jesu"

I first read this tale many years ago, having grabbed it off the shelf because it had two things I wanted: a story about ""Dragons"" (which it wasn't, lol) and it was THICK. I needed a book that would last me a while. Well this story is so engaging that you don't notice how long it is.

There is going to be the ""on the road traveling"" sections that can be slow to mildly interesting since this is where we see character, relationship and world building. It is going to be an indepth wonderful world full of all different kinds of characters. There is magic, dragons, fighting, adventure. There are parts w"
6026,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"I loved this book. My husband warned me it would be a slowburner, but I was hooked from almost the very start. Simon is a very lovable main character and I loved the friendship that formed between him and the troll Binabik. This friendship made all the hardships they have to endure more beareable. The world-building is done very expertly. It is a great world and my heart really went out to all the people in it when large portions of it were destroyed."
6027,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"""I've dreamt in my life dreams that have stayed with me ever after, and changed my ideas: they've gone through and through me, like wine through water, and altered the colour of my mind. And this is one..."" Look, I'll be honest. This is not getting a 5 star rating because the book is perfect (or without issues) but because there's a reason that it's referred to as a seminal work of fantasy that has influenced later writers. (I actually had to go and google Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire"
6028,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,"2.5 stars. Finally, it seemed like it took FOREVER to finish this book. It iss about 750 pages, but when reading 30 pages a day (that was my goal to finish before the due date at the library) feels like it takes hours, there's something wrong here. It doesn't help that the first maybe 150 pages, almost nothing at all happens. I don't want to be completely negative about this book though, I did enjoy it at times. I liked the characters, and felt like I knew the featured ones by the end of the boo"
6029,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,I love reading Tad Williams. I hate reading Tad Williams. I love reading Tad Williams. His prose flows like no other. His words come together in a way that makes them almost disappear into the image of the world. I hate reading Tad Williams. It is SO LOOOOOOOOOONG! Exciting moments like the escape from the castle or the discovery of a burned out monastery are separated by hundreds of pages of eyeball-bleeding stretches of nothing. I love reading Tad Williams. His world and creatures are some of the
6030,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"I can't quite pinpoint why this series resonates so much with me. It definitely has its flaws; it borrows themes and characters from other stories, it is excruciatingly long, it hits on some well worn fantasy clichés (magic swords, mysterious wizard mentors, a wolf and peasant-becomes-king) and there are is a smattering of Tolkien-esque contrivances that would be cringe-worthy except... I don’t know. Maybe because I walked past the book and stared at the cover for months in the bookstore before I"
6031,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"I just finished this book for the second time (audiobook this time) about 25 years after my first reading and it's quite as good as I remember. The reader is excellent and the content is rich, deep, and full of fantastic character development and stories within stories. Williams has long been one of my favorite writers for his strong (and numerous) characters and for his excellent writing style. ""The Dragonbone Chair"" lays the groundwork for this epic series and provides the history of a broad wo"
6032,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,"I read a thing that told me this was one of George R.R. Martin 's major influences for a Song of Ice and Fire, so I added it to my reading list. And I liked this one - great world building, and Williams adds depth that is usually lacking in fantasy/adventure novels. (Martin adds even more depth, but his inspiration is clear). If I listed them, there would be a lot of spoilers here that Martin blatantly copied and adapted. So, although this book is typical in that it follows certain conventions fo"
6033,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"Tad Williams's Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn series is definitely in my top five for fantasy adventure epics. Everything one could ask for from an engrossing epic is here -- an unlikely hero, a mysterious wizard, a dwarf whose dialect sounds like English translated from German, elves, twisted demonic villains, religious symbolism, druids living in solitude, long-lost underground cities... the list goes on and on. While some with whom I have discussed these books, and Williams's other novels, believe"
6034,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"It kind of takes a while to get going. I put it down at 10%. I picked it up again after finishing Terry Goodkind's Confessor series. Comparatively, confusing pronunciation everywhere, slightly confusing geography and dialects and just confused. Until suddenly I wasn't. And oh it's worth the slog. Simon is a lovely lovely clever character. I wondered at the start if he was a little... Slow? But then so am I so perhaps I was self identifying a bit there. Anyway, he's gorgeously drawn - as are his"
6035,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,While this book may start off with a slower pace Tad Williams shows he has mastered this quality in reading. His book builds suspense until the reader feels like he or she cannot put the book down until Tad has resolved the current dilemma. The author then takes that built suspense and funnels it to propel the reader through impressive amounts of detail and history from the world of this series. The characters in this novel are strong and full of character and Tad makes the reader feel like they
6036,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,2,"Ok, I tried. Got through 23 of the 45 chapters and I just can't take any more. There's a story here I want to read, and Williams definitely has talent, but damn does he need an editor. His long-winded descriptions are maddening and unnecessary. The actual action that has taken place in the first 23 chapters could have easily taken place in 5. Tell me the King died and his funeral was well-attended, don't give me an extra six hundred words detailing the precise way his body was wrapped and prepar"
6037,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"LOVED. IT. And this launches one of the greatest fantasy series ever written. Just WOW! An orphan boy, Prophecy, Magic Swords, Dark Lords, Magic, Knights, Adventure. I admit to having read this series about 3 times. So naturally I am biased toward the LOVED IT category. I was pretty young the first time I read it. And never before had I been captivated so much by an authors use of words. Each sentence just seemed marvelously put together. The story starts out with Simon in the Hayolt, just sorta"
6039,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,"This was a difficult book to finish. I can't say its bad, cause its not. The writing is sufficiently tight, and the character enjoyable enough, even the setting is quite vivid. And yet, there was something keeping me from diving head first in to this book. It may have been entirely me. I've read so much epic fantasy by now that the story of a young kitchen boy swept up in world changing events and dark evil plots may just seem too cliched to this jaded reader. It definitely worth a read since th"
6040,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,"I really MUST reread this series, as for 12 years I've been telling people that it is ""the best fantasy trilogy after Tolkien,"" and one should never, even make a book recomendation based on a book one only read in highschool. I have hope that it will still be good, as I read it at a time when I did have taste (post Eddings, Shanara, etc.) and could appreciate how Williams built characters, setting, and both played with and worked outside of traditional trappings of fantasy. I'm putting it on my"
6042,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,"No idea how to rate this one. It’s far too long. At least 400 pages could be cut off easy. The pacing is awful. The first half of the book nothing happens. But despite all that, when it’s good it’s actually alright. Not amazing by any stretch but it’s enjoyable. Typical cliffhanger ending fooling me into wanting to read the next one (which I will eventually), but for now something new. 3 stars seem a fair middle ground. Didn’t hate it (although I was close sometimes), and didn’t love it. Accepta"
6043,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,"Wow. Just Wow. There are meant to be words coming from my mouth and my keys but there aren't. This was just so good. I love and want to smack Simon upside the head, in the beginning at least. I've always loved the average person goes on a journey trope and this scratched an itch I didn't even realize I had. I'm so interested to see how a couple of different plot points work out, keeping it vague here for spoilers. I have the second on my shelf, picked up from God knows where but I think I'm prob"
6044,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"I've lost track of how many times I've read this, one of my favorite epic fantasies. Is it a cliche? Yes, the main character is a castle scullion who is destined for greater things. Not exactly an original idea, but it's so well executed. The first section of the book, before Simon goes off on his adventure, is a bit slow and I couldn't quite get past it the first time I tried to read to book. Once I was able to overcome that, though, I lost myself in the world Williams created."
6046,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,"The beginning is a bit slow, it took me several days of slogging through it before it finally got good enough for me to be convinced it was worth reading. It took me longer than usual to read it because it didn't hold my interest as well as it could have. But it isn't a bad book, it's actually a good book and well written it just wasn't as exciting as I'm used to reading otherwise I'd have given it a five and read it within three days rather than a couple of weeks."
6047,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,"An epic tale of good versus evil. The tale begins with a scullion boy in a castle who wants more for his life, but doesn't know how to get it. He is curious, but also innately kind and thoughtful. Acquiring guides along the way, the boy begins to learn, finds adventure, maybe even more than he bargained for. Who is he, and why is he so important to the story? I will probably have to read the next book to find out."
6048,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,"Many of the reviews for this book are correct: it is a very slow read for the first 1/2 of the book, then it really picks up. By the end I was pretty invested in the characters and enjoyed the read, and I plan on reading the next book. The amount of characters (and their hard to remember names), the numerous plot lines, and the constant bashing of Catholicism (I am not Catholic), sometimes gave me pause as to whether I would continue reading this book."
6049,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"When I first read this at age 14 I really didn't grasp the complexity of the story. I spent most of my time unable to delay gratification and skipping ahead to see what happened to Simon. I'm almost done with it now at age 24 and I am enjoying it much more. I remember enough to keep me going, but its full of new surprises now that I am mature enough in my critical reading skills to take pleasure in."
6050,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,"I have to take some time off and think before reviewing The Dragonbone Chair . I give it 4* now as the book is really pretentious, but, on the other hand, this was something I kinda disliked. I can't stop feeling that the author wrote this book already as an epic high fantasy book and I hate it! Anyway, despite my personal problems, it was a good book."
6051,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,I tried but couldn't finish it. I thought it was very imaginative and the world building was amazing. I can see why it has earned a place in the pantheon of the best of fantasy. But the pacing just kept getting bogged down. Every time I put it down it took a while to pick it up again. Until finally I stopped trying. It lacked the tension that I love in Terry Brooks novels.
6053,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"This isn't a book, this is a mother fucking epic! it was rather hard getting started into this book but, my god, it is so complex, deep, well thought and driven. This book will definitely be one of my top suggestions to anybody who enjoys reading fantasy."
6054,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,"This started out kind of slow; there is quite a bit of stage-setting and backstory that I found a little tedious to slog through. But, it does end up paying dividents as the plot's pace picks up considerably in the last third of the book. Looking forward to the other 2 books in the series."
6055,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"One of the best contemporary epic fantasy trilogies. Treading in the same ground of course as Tolkein, Brooks, and many others, but yet with a freshness and emotion that many of his contemporary authors lack. I have a signed hardcover copy by Tad Williams. :)"
6056,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,I've read this book about 5 times over the last twenty years and I will read it again. It engulfs me into the world of Osten Ard every time and the strikingly different societies that occupy this world
6057,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,"a little bit slow in the beginning,but i am somewhere at the 100ish page,so giving it more chance to prove...hope it will *** Actually i will put the book a side and finish it some other time.. I have a feeling it deserves to be read but i am just not in the mood at this point. **** giving up..."
6058,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"Wow, absolutely stands the test of time. I've read it a few times before, but the last time was over a decade ago. Sharing the journey with these characters is like visiting lifelong friends. Rich, compelling storytelling from start to finish. Bring on Book 2!"
6059,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"Though this was actualy a re-read (which I discovered slowly page by page , not being sure at the start as I read Feist as well, and I think he found some inspiration in this book ...), I again enjoyed it , and want to continue re-reading the whole series. My compliments Mr. Williams .."
6060,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,"I am rather sentimental about this book, since this series got me into fantasy/speculative fiction. I suppose it might lose a star if I were to reread it now, but in my head it is a great fantasy read."
6061,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"Reading this novel is not a light endeavor, but it is well worth it. While the narrative is sometimes slowed by the pure density of the prose, that same richness of language and description sets the world and characters of The Dragonbone Chair in the rarest of company in epic fantasy."
6063,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"A stunning epic fantasy. Really good, vivid, deep, complex, rich world and characters. Can't wait to tear into more of this great series and author."
6064,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,I usually devour Tad Williams' books but I found this book to be a bit slow going.
6065,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,One of my favorite books ever read!
6066,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,"I'm not sure about this book. It took about 300 pages before I was interested and then the ending just...it's a cliffhanger. I liked it, but not sure if enough to read the next few books :("
6067,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"I remember reading this whole series when I was about 15, I want to read it again soon, I absolutely loved these books back then."
6068,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,This was good series...
6069,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,I loved this book. That is saying a lot considering fantasy has never been a genre I pick up or usually finish. Simon is a great character and I enjoyed being part of his adventures.
6070,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,Huge story with slow start. Just not my kind of story
6071,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,Fantastic tale with good turns and unexpected turns. The end (book 3) was a bit of a letdown.
6072,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,"Classic, epic, good, but very slow paced."
6073,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,"A good trilogy. Excellent twist at the very end. A little minimalist on the magic system, but that's a style choice."
6074,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,The Qanuc have another saying: 'Welcome stranger. The paths are treacherous today.' Love the beginning of a great saga!
6075,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,Excellent story!! Little slow at first but well worth finishing!!!
6076,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,I read this long before I was a goodreads member. I remember as being pretty standard epic S&S fantasy. Not boring but not memorable.
6077,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,A good beginning to the series. This is the second read-through I've done and I really see things I did not notice before.
6078,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,Superb story. The stuff that makes up dreams. The whole trilogy is awesome.
6079,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"If you are a fantasy fan, it doesn't get better than this!"
6080,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,"A little slow to start, but an enjoyable read."
6081,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,The first book of the greatest Fantasy saga ever!!
6082,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"Read these three books then stop. Everything else he's ever written just pales by comparison, but these three, these are MAGIC."
6083,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,1,i didnt like this book after 200 pages nothing happened the whole 200 pages is about some boy in a castle where nobody likes him boring
6084,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,This is the book I was searching for forever. I'm glad I found it. Recently I have been very dissatisfied with so many of the highly recommended books in the fantasy genre. Some of the books I hated have a rating above 4.0 here on GR. Here are the landmines commonly found in popular fantasy titles which were blessedly absent in this book: 1. Dystopian world of oppression and doom 2. Characters so unbelievable they belong in a comic book and should never show their Mary Sue Badass faces in the world
6085,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,"This isn’t an easy book. Tad Williams eases you in with familiar fantasy tropes by dropping you into the world of Osten Ard, where you follow the day-to-day life of a scullion and the drama surrounding the impending succession of a great king. It all feels nice and cosy and is made that much more pleasant as a result of Williams’ evocative prose. (After reading this book, I’d venture to say that Williams is one of the best sentence crafters in all of fantasy) The book then takes a dip in the firs"
6086,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,"Ooooooo - this is the start of something epic! I love this genre - it gives you so much to think about! Such hope and such despair - the feeling that fate and destiny are truly just a matter of choices, some made by yourself, some made by others. This was masterfully written to illustrate that. How a bumbling air-brained dreamer can be in the center of a vortex of change without any perceivable determined obvious choice, just what seems to be random chances and circumstances. It's a very interes"
6087,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,"Contents: PG. no sex, no swearing, but grim death, sad scenes, some torture, and various gruesome creatures. I especially enjoyed the terrifying scene with the nest of ghants. I read the trilogy, so this review reflects all three books. Told in third person, my favorite POV for fiction. High fantasy with kings, wizards, dragons, trolls, elves (fair ones / Sithi), giants, etc. The theme is grim enough, but the brave fellowship holds together, despite some losses -- even the animals.

6088,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,"I'm having a hard time deciding whether this book deserves four stars or five, because it took me so god damned long to slog through it. It was full of beauty and wonder and real feeling, but a page-turner it was not. I read it in three bursts separated by months, and in a world filled with books of comparable length that I find myself tearing through in a matter of days, it seems like something that didn't grab me with so tight a hold maybe shouldn't get full marks. The thing is, though, that t"
6089,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,"Okay, before I begin, a little history. My father bought this book (the very copy I just finished, in fact) shortly after it went to paperback, and read it to the family aloud during a camping trip. I was a teenager, already ""over"" fantasy and mainly into science fiction, particularly of the televised variety. I listened with half an ear. Years later in my early 20's, I tried reading it for myself, and got only as far as the first few chapters of the second book before I decided I lost patience. Bu"
6090,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,"I have spent a long time searching for a modern fantastical epic which is worth reading. It seems like there should be one, out there, somewhere. I have so enjoyed the battlefields of Troy , the dank cavern of Grendel's dam, Dido's lament, Ovid's hundred wild-spun tales , perfidious Odysseus , the madness of Orlando, Satan's twisted rhetoric , and Gilgamesh's sea-voyage to the forgotten lands of death. And so I seek some modern author to reinvent these tales with some sense of scholarship, poetry, c"

This first installment serves as a nice introduction to the contemplative albino sorcerer, who rules the ancient, powerful land of Melnibone. It was a nice surprise to learn that in the never ending, multi-dimensional cosmic dust up between"
6092,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,"I have always detested Michael Moorcock. As a fantasy reader whose passion for Tolkien’s writing knows no boundaries, I have always had a hard time swallowing the venomous spite and blind arrogance with which he’s been denouncing the champion of my fantasy dreams. Generally speaking, I never felt anything against authors who attempted to step out of Tolkien’s shadow. These separatists, as I enjoy calling them, count shining stars like Mervyn Peake and China Mieville among their ranks, both men I"

6094,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,"This is some epic awesomeness. I'm an absolute sucker for the grand sweeping personal quests to gain more and yet more magical power in the service of rescuing your one true love, casting aside morals, the greater good, your own health, and possibly your own sanity. This tale holds up perfectly after all this time. All the best aspects of modern fantasy are encapsulated and written with such spartan clarity and diamond sharpness within Moorcock's classic. I only needed this one taste and I'm now"
6095,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,"It pleases me to return, after many years, to the saga of Elric VIII, Emperor of Melnibone, the doomed albino with the icy demeanor and imperious nature whose constant companion is Stormbringer, a bloodthirsty sword with a consciousness and will all its own. Elric is the sickly descendant of a haughty alien race, a long line of amoral conquerors and wielders of magic. Many of his nobles—including his cousin, the accomplished magician Yrkoon—do not think the young emperor is fit for his high task"

Note that I am referencing when Elric first appeared which was in Moorcock’s novella, ""The Dreaming City"" (Science Fantasy #47, June 1961 (Wiki). Note that this is one of my early reviews so the format is different. CONCEPT: Very interesting. This one was done in the 60s before there were a lot of Sci fi/Fantasy writers. Moorcock is definitely one of the older writers and his works range in quality though fortunately"
6098,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,"This is the first book of a classic fantasy series with an iconic anti-hero. From what I understand the author tried to create something different from The Lord of the Rings ; at the time this book was published the majority of fantasy genre consisted of The Lord of the Rings clones. Considering that the series now has a status of genre classics, the author succeeded. The main hero Elric is an albino who happened to be the Emperor of Melniboné and who must use potions to maintain his strength. He"

He’s an albino with white skin, long white hair, and slanting red eyes. He’s weak and has to take drugs every few hours just to maintain the strength of a normal man. He’s a brooding and contemplative scholar, which makes him dull at parties.

But my friend liked this story, so I said I'd read it. :) I don't understand how this stuff got popular. Not at all.

I think I liked it a bit better this time because I can better see all of the neat elements that Moorcock put into the world of Elric. Elemental lords, Chaos gods, and the war between Law and Chaos are just a few of the worldbuilding elements that really made this work shine. I still can't give it five stars, however, because Elric has got to be one of the dumbest protagonists in fantasy literature. I mean, how many times do you let"

Elric is not a hero nor is he on a quest to save the world. In fact, while not going out of his way to destroy the world, the character of Elric would be more at home as a villain than as the central character of a fantasy series. But this is what Elric is, and these stories, originally published as"
6108,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,"This was a very charming book in its own morbid way. Elric is the singularly badass Emperor of Melniboné--a debauched, weird island nation that used to be a sprawling, powerful empire. Apparently it's considered completely uncool to be anything but self-possessed, icy and callous on Melniboné but Elric seems to be of a different stock than most of his pale kin--a bit more introspective and even moralistic. This alone presents him with several problems, and compounding things is his cousin Yyrkoo"

It is not a question of an old book holding up in this case, rather Elric is obviously a pace setter that countless that follow can only hope to keep up with. If anything I have proven to myself that some of the classics of the genre are considered so for a reason; I will drop a minor heresy in that given a choice I would rer"

6112,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,"I picked this for my reading challenge and I was not disappointed, but rather pissed at myself that I was putting it away for so long. I was surprised how fresh it felt, considering that Elric was born somewhere between years 1960 and 1970. Quite a fast paced story, rather short and not overly detailed, it takes us into the decadent and violent land of Melniboné, where sorcerers live side by side with dragons and demons of higher and lower planes. Melnibonéans drown their days in cruel rituals a"
6113,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,"I read this one years ago. When I ran across this audio version I picked it up. Having not read any of the Eternal Champion volumes for a long time it sort of ""reminded me"" how much I liked many of them. This short book serves as a sort of ""intro"" to the entire Elric saga and we get a look at much of the character Mr. Moorcock was building for Elric (and I'd forgotten how annoying Elric could be). This (these actually as it applies to the Elric series) is a book I'd recommend for anyone who likes"
6114,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,"In which Elric fights off his cousin's usurpation, first strikes a deal with Arioch and other higher powers, meets Rackhir the Red Archer, acquires the sword Stormbringer, and makes a lot of terrible choices in the name of defying Fate and the Powers That Be. Overwrought and amateurish, and yet still a classic of fantastic literature: wonderfully dry (you can almost picture him writing these books with one eyebrow continuously cocked at his typewriter), compelling, a quick read, and full of the g"

Their agon includes a series of coups and counter-coups, and results in a bizarre duel with sentient nuclear-swords on the wrong side of the last sphincter in hell's colon.

One is that book which will make one feel warm and hopeful. There is other type which will make one gloomy and depressive. And Elric of Melnibone belongs to the other kind. Wow!

It is rather sad that only the hardcore fantasy geeks have read this incredibly original piece of work.

Denyse was an intriguing figure to me. I never had the courage to ask her out. While she did not look like Morticia Addams, she had a certain dark allure about her, like Morticia. If she ever reads this, I hope she takes this in a good way. Anyway, at the party, Denyse mentioned that she'd read Elric and found something in the books that she never got out of "" The Lord of the"

Elric first appeared in several novelettes in the early 1960's (later collected as sequels to this volume). Here, the brooding wizard prince of the ancient and powerful kingdom fights his male cousin, Yrkoon, for a seat on the Ruby Throne, and the love of his female cousin, Cymoril. As a physically frail, well educated, wizard Elric is the opposite of the traditional warrior hero. This book stands the test of time and remains a exc"

6122,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,"Couldn't put this one down. The prose is gorgeous, the pace is swift, and Elric is fascinating as a sort of anti-Conan protagonist. Can't wait to get my hands on the rest of the series."
6123,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,"One of the classics of the genre. It has aged well. Odd circumstances and fanciful worlds, as with other Moorcock works. It would pair well with some Pink Floyd or Blue Öyster Cult playing in the background. Readers of Moorcock would not be surprised to learn that he wrote lyrics for a few BÖC songs."

I wasn't sure whether it would begin a re-read of all the Elric books or be just a one off. I first read this (along with a whole swathe of Moorcock's work) back in the 90's some time. Back then, there were still quite a few second hand book stores around where you would often find these old 70's paperbacks. The real challenge was working out a reading order, especially in the days before the internet. Th"

The article asserts that Tolkien supported ""a conservative vision of the status quo"", whereas Moorcock's Elric stories are ""about law and chaos, and how, sometimes, choosing one over the other is no more or less just."" You could also make a case that Moorcock's writing style is the antithesis of Tolkien's too. Elric of Melnibone was published in 1972 (though its roots go back to the 1960s),"
6129,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,"A very interesting and well written set of books with the central character being Elric of Melnibone. Elric is an Albino king who is very sickly and weak until he discovers ""stormbringer"" a 'rune sword' of incredible power. With it, he is able to restore himself to the throne and many other things but it is bittersweet. The sword Stormbringer exacts its own price. The whole ""Elric"" series is well written, a fast read, and full of twists and changes."
6130,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,"Beautiful book touching on the conflicting nature of men, morality, personal gain and destiny. It oddly reminded me of Ursula K. Le Guin’s work, which I think mostly had to do with the writing style. Moorcock’s writing is simple and concise, and it relies mostly on recounting events but somehow still maintains an air of mystery and doesn’t take away from character development. I really liked it! For a prince of the Dragon Isle Elric of Melniboné was primarily an esoteric character."

That influence is clear here - his sentences are not as long and his language not quite as beautiful but it echoes Peake's; not quite imitative but clearly inspired. The writing, then, is wonderful. Unlike Peake's classic though, this is essentially an adventure story and so is short and punchy in the way of swords and sorcery yarns. Moorcock's hero, tho"

The character of Elric is probably the strongest part about this book. He is not the typical strongman fantasy protagonist who lets be honest, by this time has become quite predictable. His flawed nature, weak constitution and distaste for authority and power make him refreshing, to say the least. ""He mourns th"

The Melniboneans are an Ancient race of humans, characterised by their self importance, hedonistic ways, and distinct lack of compassion for others. Very similar to the traditional fantasy dark elves, although of course their appearance is human.

6142,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,"Somehow this glorious gem escaped me all these years. Vintage fantasy, written in an old-world style reminiscent of Norse saga; swords-and-sorcery in a beautifully described, intriguing world. The hero, Elric, is quintessential. Strange even in his own realm of Melniboné—which to the rest of the mortal world is strange enough—he is tormented and full of insecurities. Yet he is brilliant, and through power and courage drawn from an ancient lineage, he overcomes his shortcomings in revolutionary,"
6143,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,"I've read this book about 3 times and I've enjoyed it each time. If this is pulp, it's the epitome of the art form. Moorcock brings a darkness to his fantasy that we don't really see as much anymore. It's scary, it's heroic, it's tragic and it's good. Note: This is the first of the original Elric Saga and it's a complete novel. I say that because subsequent books are more akin to collections of short stories and novellas. The notable exception being Stormbringer, the final novel in the original s"

The entire time I was reading I kept thinking, ""this is it?"" - It's super short, there isn't much character development or action - it reads like a Wikipedia summation of a book. I think it's more of a book that I might have wanted to read in middle school. I'm just not seeing how this series makes a bunch of the ""must read fantasy"" lists. I am not even sure that I want to bother reading the next books. It wasn't bad - it just wasn't goo"
6145,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,Fantasy doesn't mean medieval europe with magic or dragons. I don't find any inherent fault with that particular setting... I love its dreaminess and perilousness in certain works (aka lotr) but a great fantasy needs imagination and not just good storytelling. a greater fantasy explores 'alternatives'. that is why Elric of Melnibone is great. it explores and chooses different things to tell. It doesn't tread familiar grounds and does not reach safe pleasant destinations. A must read for everyone
6146,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,"I barely remember reading this, except that I like the art and the story moved along nicely. My problem with Elric books is that there are multiple realities and universes (take note, DC Comics) which makes the events in any one universe or reality largely irrelevant. I mean, just go to a new universe when you screw the old one up, no big deal. That kind of takes all the drama out of any planet-threatening event, doesn't it?"

Everyone was making heroes based on him, which created a very stale subgenre. If you ever read any Conan books, you know he’s a very dry hero. There is nothing special about him as a personality and the world around him doesn’t affect him in some way. The same was happening with every other hero of that time, including Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser, who had invented the term of Sword and Sorcery. So"

Elric of Melnibone has been on my to-read list for years and by the time I've wanted to read it, I couldn't find it anywhere! The only Elric books I could find were the ones in the Last Emperor of Melnibone series. I read the first book in that series, which was simply a collection of short Elric stories. While it was fun, I enjoyed a full-length novel much more. The original Elric series is nigh impossible to track down. I"

Unfortunately, as an adult I found this book almost unbearable. It was a bore to finish, despite being short. The plot itself didn't interest me, and neither did the meta level of philosophy and mythology.

Elric is one of fantasy's most intriguing characters, and has sparked some rather heated debates as to whether or not he can be defined as a ""hero"" in the classic sense. (I say yes). Elric is NOT, Conan, for which many of us with literary leanings can be profoundly grateful. Michael Moorcock took fantasy o"

A supremely flawed character in a vicious world, he is the archetype for so many anti-heroes it beggars belief. If you want to read the progenitor of the modern fantasy world, read Moorcock. The theme of the Eternal Champion is explored in multiple incarnations within multiple worlds and ultimately they are all aspects of the same hero, woven together over stacked planes of existence. Apart from the metaphysical, Moorcock is such an accessible w"

Elric , the most powerful sorcerer, warrior and emperor of kingdom has been easily tricked by his cousin Yyrkoon, who has been taken as prisoner, escapes and kidnaps Elric's beloved princess. So the story goes around this act. I found this plot rather naive and uncreative hence a bit disappointing. Still the book is worth reading. According to some critics, this book is the father of modern fiction-epics."

It’s neither consistently terrible nor consistently better than average, some aspects of the world are intriguing while others are boring, some of the writing is solid and some is amateurish, but overall it’s unsuccessful as it fails to make you care one iota about the by-the-numbers story that it’s telling until the book is nearly over.

6173,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,"I picked this up expecting something like the Drizzt Do'urden novels that clearly borrowed from Elric liberally. Instead, the tone and pacing was much more like reading myths or Arthurian legends. Characters are pretty two-dimensional, even the protagonist, but not in a bad way. They come across more as archetypes than as tropes. Almost all the navel-gazing happens through dialogue rather than internal monologue, and Elric doesn't seem to be brilliant, just principled and sometimes unsure of why"

The books were huge, huge hits in the 60’s and 70’s because Moorcock was able to create a series that had all the themes of the time (sex, drugs, desire for peace, the struggles for freedom and need to follow your own path).

The opening is like some super-over-the top Conan novel but the last third felt more darkly humorous, as if the characters had wandered into Time Bandits or Labyrinth or something.

6180,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,The story of Elric was the first I read of Michael Moorcock's works. It was also the first time I was introduced to the concept of Law and Chaos and their associated Gods. This is fantasy on a level so objectively different to the standard that Tolkein created with Middle Earth yet just as powerful in its own right. Moorcock has created a Multiverse that is so interconnected that I doubt you can find any of his works that do not have some form of relationship to another - in this case it is Elri

I am sure I would have liked it more if I had read it all those years ago though. It is a good yet simple plot more for the younger readers but still enjoyable for an old guy like me.

Explaining to people why someone like Moorcock is good not an easy task, especially once you get into the bit about summoning demons and dragons.

I think it was a bad idea to read a translation for this one. Main reason: translation age more quickly than originals. This one is something like twenty years old and the whole series could do with a brand new French makeover. Of course, perhaps the original book has aged as well. Not having read it, I can't really comment on that. What I can say is that heroic fantasy is not my favorite fantasy subge"
6197,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,1,"Elric is an emperor of Melniboné, an island nation that celebrates debauchery and torture. Physically weak and dependent on herbal remedies to keep his health, Elric is an odd choice for emperor, and he is also albino and red-eyed. Melniboné ruled the world for thousands of years and has only recently fallen from grace, and Elric would like to change that, but his morals and ideas--still horrid by human standards, but kinder than most of his race--are considered bizarre by others. His cousin Yyr"
6198,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,2,"I read this and the original Elric novels at approximately age 12, when I still read sci-fi and fantasy and wandered through my library's adult and young adult collections reading whatever looked interesting. This short novel and its sequels are pagan gothic sci-fi/fantasy, about the adventures of an outcast former emperor who becomes the servant of a chaos god and travels the world (and eventually the multiverse) fighting battles. This first novel serves mainly to introduce the character and set"
6199,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,"Elric was goth before there was goth. What if we put a pallid & pensive king in charge of a brutal and entirely physical kingdom? He's kind of moody and a bit reluctant (about just about everything), but his character works in contrast to the hedonistic draconian society that he is supposed to be ruling. Remarkably, we get to see growth and development of the Elric which is more than I was expecting in a punchy high-concept fantasy novella. Moorcock doesn't want to waste time, which I apprec"
6200,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,"This was a nice, short book. I really wish the author had not so loudly criticized Tolkien and set this book up as a contrast. It really is not even in the same ballpark as Tolkien's accomplishments. The one thing I will grant him is that his main character Elric is conflicted about what exactly constitutes ""right"" and ""wrong"", and though I would never call that a virtue, it does make Elric interesting at least. The Melniboneans, however, are a very poorly conceived, and poorly developed, people."
6201,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,"A fine start to the cycle but not on a level with the benchmarks LOTR or Game of Thrones. Potentially on par with LeGuin's Earthsea cycle although my impression so far is that she's a better writer. I like that Elric starts out as a conflicted character torn between brutal tradition and moral doubts. He's no super hero. Physically weak, he only survived infancy due to healing magic. Each day, he needs to take drugs to cleanse his poisoned blood. Those were the 70's when an addict could be an elev"
6202,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,"This book goes fast. It's fun and sometimes surreal and hints at a huge world with rich lore and so on. Elric of Melnibone is the emperor of the most powerful people on the planet and happens to be the most powerful man on the planet, which makes this interesting to read for various reasons. One being that I've never read anything with an overpowered hero. His downside is that he has a terminal disease that he staves off with drugs, so he's basically a drug addict sorcerer emperor who's also a gr"

Elric, who is literally the whitest man in the world, is weak and has no mojo. He must take drugs to keep up his ""strength."" In order to regain his mojo, he has to go and claim a Giant Black Phallic Symbol, after which he will become extremely ""potent."" In order to lay hands on the sword ""Stormbringer"" (the"
6204,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,"First book of the new year. I liked it fine, but I think I'm a bit too 2017 for it, having expected something a bit more ironic. The opening pages veer dangerously close to self-parody, especially for anyone who's read anything by Robert E. Howard. It took me a chapter to get into the right frame of mind. Once I was there, though, I was hooked. Elric has been much-parodied - fiction that takes itself so seriously lends itself very well to satire - and I think these parodies haunted my conscience a"

Moorcock is not much for expanding details but there's no doubt that the series it's original, darke"

Melniboneans are known for doing only what pleases them, with no regard for the feelings of others. They have their rules and customs, but basic human emotions are foreign to them. The one man that stands apart just so happens to be the emperor, Elric. Elric must choose between his budding feelings and ruling the way the people demand. His throne will be challenged, but the questions remains,"
6208,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,"Elric, the ruler of Melnibone, contends with the evil Yyrkoon for possession of the throne. What gives this novel its place in fantasy history is the groundbreaking introduction of the anti-hero to sword and sorcery. Elric comes from a cruel people and has no compunctions about employing torture to further his ends, although he does have a fatal fascination for conventional ideas of morality. Unfortunately, Michael Moorcock is not a very good stylist, perhaps because he was writing in the vein of"
6209,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,"Although it is difficult to grasp Moorcock's descriptive tones, this book invigorated my love of fantasy. Elric is the anti-hero, or pseudo-hero, or whatever you want to call it that I love to see in a character. The setting is amazing, the adventure is tumultuous and exciting. Once I started reading this book, I fell in love with everything about it. Definitely looking forward to finishing this series."
6210,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,"Elric of Melniboné is one of those books that I should have read ages ago. I always heard that Elric was some sort of anti-hero, and I didn't want to read about bastards doing bastardly things. I have enough of that in real life, right? However, at least in this book, Elric is the nicest guy in Melniboné, which isn't saying much. But seriously, he's a likable character that I actually felt sorry for. The striking thing about this book is that it is Sword & Sorcery stuff, but minus all the ov"
6211,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,"Classic fantasy from the 70's. It's fun to go back and read the old books that inspired the stories of today. This one is pretty straightforward. The hero is weak physically but powerful in other ways. He's trying to stand up to the long held beliefs (or lack thereof) within his society. Also there are sentient swords and he's some kind of albino. Also, at 170 pages, it's kind of a nice change of pace from the giant volumes that are more popular now. There isn't room for a ton of depth, but the p"

It wouldn't kill me so much if it wasn't so undeniably original, captivating and occasionally awe-inducing! Though that pretty much comes with the sword-and-sorcery territory, and all too often the greater fantasy category and much of speculative fiction as a whole, I must admit I'm disappointed. The two-star rating is because Elric of Melnibone h"

It read like Lord Dunsany but without the magic, it was look I'm creating a world and it will be magnificent and have flying boats and sword fights and magic and stuff but it felt like the log from someone's D&D campaign. Elric was a terrible Gary Stu, I didn't associate with any of the characters and I found the story itself boring. I didn't like the prose or the narrative voice. In fact I found myself hoping that Melnibone migh"
6214,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,"Moorcock is a capable writer, technically. One of the difficulties I had was trying to figure out if the dialogue was cliche because he was one of the epic fantasy forefathers, or if the language was already tired when he wrote it in the '60s. Either way the dialogue is bad and there is almost no actual adventuring, which is what I was looking forward to. We are basically given an outline of events and the reader is not allowed along for the ride. I feel like Moorcock just wrote the ""important p"

The plot is linear, the characters are flat, and the novel itself is slow moving despite the fact that it is only 180 pages. This had the potential of becoming something so much more and moving beyond the cliche and often times contrived sci-fi/fantasy writing that has plagued the genera for so long. Instead, it kept within strict confines that left me bored and not quite understanding what people see in thi"
6216,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,"Its still early to empathize or even understand Elric given his eccentricity and actions that seems to stem from impluse. His adventure will make you breathless and the swashbuckling fun. And then there are brother swords. As I read this, I see its influence on many modern fantasy writers. The moment I read the sword has a ""brother"", I immediately thought of Voldemort and HP. There is a mirror that shows memories. It goes on. The story may seem very bleak and superficial as Moorcock keeps the flow"
6217,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,"Still on of my favorite fantasy series ever... simple yet enticing, with an anti-hero -- Elric -- the likes of which has never been equaled. And the books tended to only got better through the series, until it culminated with STORMBRINGER, the last of Moorcock's ""original"" six Elric books (some of which were really shorter stories bound into one book). In recent decades, he's gone back and written other Elric novels, most of which failed to capture any of the magic the originals did. Sometimes,"

Oh wait a minute. I did play a lot of online games, I think it was super old school, Ultima or something like that. Anyway, I thought i was a loner in liking this series, but it turns out I have met other really obscure fantasy geeks out there who have read this series too. This series has been the source of a lot of my high school paintings and geeky draw"
6220,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,"This book goes everywhere I'm staying at for a while, because supposed grown-up or no, it makes me go purr. To be given to teenagers everywhere in place of the usual thoughtless sword-swinging high fantasy - this is what fantasy should be like, in terms of places: scenery you just don't get on earth, taken as normal by the people who live there, a sense of history that doesn't stifle the present with prophesies...oh, and elves that never refer to themselves as such and would probably offhandedly"
6221,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,"So, I finally got around to reading this one. I think maybe its one of those books that was great for its time, but doesn't hold up as well today. It holds up better than most from that era, to my mind. But, that still leaves room for improvement. What I did like was the general since of ""classic storytelling"". In that I mean it felt very much like the old myths (Greek and Roman) that I read as a kid in the elementary school libraries. It kept a sense of wonder and enchantment. I'm not sure I'll"

But probab"
6223,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,"I devoured the Elric series during my university years. Elric is such a fascinating character - the perfect tragic hero, forced to carry a sentient, vampiric sword. I can't tell you how many D&D campaigns paid homage to that sword! ;) Elric led me to Moorcock's other novels, and barring a few of his latest works, I've read them all. Jerry Cornelius is basically a reworking of the Elric character in a (mostly) contemporary setting, so if you like the Elric novels you'll like the ones featuring"
6224,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,1,"The series started mildly interesting. I might like some of Moorcock's other work, but this series became disturbing. Elric is aligned with the force(s) of chaos. In Greek mythology, that is higher order, but I have seen no fantasy author write of chaos that way. This series is about a chaotic person who is against order. Maybe he begins as more neutral, and he is a physically ill person that may be of an ill race, but he gets worse."
6226,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,"England seems to produce a lot of great fantasy writers. Michael Moorcock carries on that tradition. In this book he does something very difficult: he creates a truly alien character. It's difficult in that, how do you create an illogical (to us) character, but which follows its own internal logic? The character Elric, for instance, studies the human ideas of ""guilt"" and ""conscience"", which make no sense to him. This book reminds me of Greek mythology, with a little H. P. Lovecraft thrown in."
6227,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,"The first thing by Moorcock I ever read. At first I had a few problems with the lack of any significant world-building on the level of Tolkein, but Moorcock isn’t trying to be as realistic as Tolkein. Instead he is creating straight fantasy. I also thought that this was in many ways the kind of thing I imagined as a young child, and I’m sorry that I hadn’t discovered Elric and Moorcock sooner. This is Elric’s origin story, about how he got Stormbringer and starts of the whole Elric saga."
6228,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,"Not classic literature, but good reading nonetheless! I needed this series when I read it, as it allowed me an escape. The characters were awesome, and the story of Elric was captivating. For those who enjoy fantasy, this series is a quick read (each book is relatively short and the writing is such that you can sail through the stories). I did tire of Moorhead's writing style once I was through this series."
6229,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,2,"A far cry from the later, more complex Moorcock, this book underwhelmed me. While an interesting example of trope/cliche creation for the fantasy genre, the story itself is rather dull and predictable. No complexity, no unforeseen twists, and very one-dimensional characters. A simple quest tale, Elric finds himself going from one obstacle or battle to the next, and overcoming them either through sorcery or the help of demon-Gods. Yawn-inducing, truly."
6230,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,"Fantastic (no pun intended...ok, maybe a little)! Although this is genre fiction, the thematic elements that define Elric as a hero and/or anti-hero are as timeless as those of the best and most complex mythological figures, and the scope of Moorcock's story reaches to the ""end of time,"" and beyond."
6231,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,"I read the Elric books as a teenager, I think I was fascinated by Elric, and his utter misery, he's dependent on the devastation that he wreaks, yet he's also thoroughly repelled by it. However, it may be one of those teenage things that you grow out of, like being a goth... I'm not sure what I'd make of the series if I re-read it."
6232,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,"A story of a fantasy anti-hero on a quest to break out of the confines of Conan and Tolkien, yet doomed to failure. I'm sympathetic to many who don't like this series. For myself I find this book's start intriguing and evocative, but the end disappointing as it basically comes down to two macho warriors swinging their penises , um, swords at each other."
6233,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,Heard of Moorcock through a recommendation from his pal Alan Moore. Elric is a demon summoning drug addled albino emperor with a constantly shifting existential moral compass - what more could you ask for from a fantasy series? I'm sure I'll definitely get round to reading the rest of these books at some point this year. Whole load of fun.
6234,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,"Yes, I seem to be in something of a science fiction/fantasy pattern in recent reading. Nostalgic, entertaining...Moorcock brings back the excitement of the sf/fantasy of the 60's and 70's, when it took on literary techniques and dark themes from the culture. This reminds me of how much I enjoyed the first few books in Roger Zelazny's Amber series. And there's a lot more Elric to read."
6235,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,"This is the first of the series featuring the brooding albino Norse hero. Probably even more captivating than Elric is his sword, Stormbringer, which swallows the souls of its victims. I've read the first three novels so far, and it's a series I like to have to fall back on when I feel like good hard fantasy."
6236,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,"Great story, not too sure about the stylistics though. Moorcock manages to stear clear of too many mock archaisms, but there is something a little flat about his prose. Will definitely read the next installment."
6237,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,"Original and interesting. The main character is awesome and the world and the atmosphere are very weird and unlike other fantasy stories. The plot is not focused enough for my taste and that's why I give it 4 instead of 5 stars. Still, I reccomend the book for fantasy fans young and old."
6238,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,"More of an outline for a novel than an actual novel, with a hyper simplistic storyline unfettered by depth of character or description. Moorcock used to brag about how many words he could pound out in a day, and it shows here. 2.5 stars."
6239,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,2,"This book started out strong but got boring around the middle. It is still some of the better Swords and Sorcery I have read. But Sword and Sorcery stories just feel so derivative to me, and been there done that. 2 Stars = It was OK."
6240,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,"Probably the best know of the Eternal Champion incarnations. Elric is a tragic figure, enough to make an ancient Greek weep with joy. Great fantasy epic. Not your Tolkien style story. Very good plots and characters. Highly recommended."
6241,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,"Old fashioned sword and sorcery. A quick and easy read. Well written, good character development for the protagonist. Is old. One can see where many new authors are taking inspiration from. 4/5, higher rating because of it being very old."
6242,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,"What an RPG, what an epic series. This book is simply in its storytelling but always grips you. Let your mind wander, an fall in love with Elric viii. This is the greatest dark fantasy of all times."
6243,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,2,"I tried to like this book, but I just couldn't. It struck me as being a rather immature story. Like it was written by a thirteen year old boy. Really not a lot of character depth or creativity. I will try another Moorcock book, because I heard he was supposed to be really good..."
6244,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,"On of the classics that has had a profound influence on fantasy but doesn't get much attention. Really creative fantasy about a villain turned hero, sort of... and of course he also has an awesome sword. It's been a long time since I read it, so memory is fuzzy, but I remember really liking it."
6245,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,2,"Uff.. how many times did your cousin betray you in the past? 1,2 times? So you're gonna go wandering and leave him back home as king with your love interest? Sure how could that ever go wrong? I'm sorry but I just can't follow the logic of the characters."
6246,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,"I can't believe it's taken me so long to read an Elric book. Growing up, Raistlin was my go-to frail, magic-minded demi-god of choice, but now I'm in the Elric camp. And at under 200 pages a volume, these books go down much easier than the swollen epic fantasy of today."
6248,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,"Wonderfully inventive and surreal, it's not hard to see why this is a cult classic. Moorcock's prose is a pleasure to read and his characters are vivid and memorable."
6249,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,I will re-read this book in the future and then I will make a proper review
6250,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,"Vintage Sword and Sorcery, relative to which modern offerings pale by comparison(almost as if thier souls are being sucked out of them through gaping, ghastly wounds)."

6252,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,"I literally threw this book across the room the first time I tried to read it. The second time, I laughed at it. The third time, I was addicted to it."
6253,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,2,"Aye, a classic in the genre. Aye, full of awkward dialogue and nonsensical motivations. Aye, Moorcock has some gall criticizing Tolkien if this is his counterexample."
6254,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,"I fell in love with this novel as a teen, and have loved Moorcock ever since. A recent re-read showed me he's still the best. This is what Fantasy should be like!"
6255,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,"This book is just amazing - sword and sorcery, protagonist with deep angst and ballad like story telling. I can still remember why I liked it so much 15 years ago."
6256,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,"Not sure if I would still like it, but have very fond memories of this one from 6th grade. Had to put it in here for Todd."

6270,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,These books were OK. They just seemed to lack heart. I don't think the writer cared about the characters.
6271,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,"Love all the Elric books. Great story, if a little wierd. Highly reccomended when you want a change from the usual swords and sorcery."
6272,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,"Great fantasy novel :-) The background music on the audio book was a bit annoying at time, but all in all a great performance by the narrator and a great story. 4.5 stars."
6273,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,This is a great story by great storyteller. I think Moorcock invented a new way to tell a pulp sword'n' sorcery type of story. Highly recommended.
6274,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,1,I have been spoiled by modern fantasy and by comparison this seems dated. It is a collection of meandering stories that (may) try to advance a central plot. Characters are paper thin.

6288,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,"It's probably been close to forty years since I read the Elric novels and, though I have a vague memory of kinda sorta digging them, I could remember very little of them. But lately, I've picked up a couple of Elric graphic novels that I enjoyed, and I've been listening to a lot of Blue Öyster Cult, who has several songs inspired by Elric. So, I went searching for my paperbacks to reread them...and I obviously lent them to some asshole who never got around to returning them. Likely the reason I r"
6289,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,2,"*2.5 stars* I say to myself POOF you're magically whisked away to the 70s, Moorcock publishes the epic of Elric. One of these things is not like the other. Woo, big hit, fast-paced, easily readable yadda yadda. Hmmm, internally conflicted protagonists? Not really new. Dragon riders? New? I guess so. Ham-fisted love story? Good lord, yes. Not my cup o' tea. Deity intervention? Hello! We're on to something here for sure. Now that stuff was cool and it probably would have worked for little imaginary"
6290,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,2,"Elric of Melnibone is a fantasy novel written by Michael Moorcock that involves the emperor of Melnibone, Elric, embarking on a quest to rescue Cymoril his close friend and romantic interest. I dislike this book. It lost my interest after the first book (this book is divided into two books) and felt too much like any other story about rescuing a princess from the antagonist. I could predict events coming up and I felt no attachment to any characters. The villain of the story ,Yykroon Elric's cous"
6291,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,"This was a great and enjoyable story. I love the names and the setup. The magic, a soft system, has a lot of cool dynamics and the pantheon of gods is awesome. I only struggle with the ending. *spoiler* I wasn't satisfied with the reasons given for letting Yrkoon live and rule in his stead for a years journey. But the scene where he made Yrkoon eat his executed servant was BRUTAL and badass. I'd honestly expected more of that, is it weird that I wanted him to be crueler? I got a thing for anti-h"

This book contians graphical representation of Foaly's (Foaly is an inventor in Fairy's World), or in short, Fairy's technologies. You will get the better idea by seeing them in pictures. at least I have. I am very thankful to author for writing this book. This book has introduced me the personalities of fairies which I didn't know before. Like I didn't know how an elf looks like. What are the na"
6294,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,Very nice book for everyone who is a fan of Artemis Fowl. I think the two stories in this book were better than the later books in the series. They are very funny and are written in the no-nonsense adventurous way of the first books before things started to take a more serious tone.
6295,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,2,"This was a book that I liked on my first reading, but loathed very certainly upon my second or third. The two-year gap might explain a bit. The two-star rating, instead of a one, is mainly because the stories included are very good. I find no flaws with them, and I've picked up the book to re-read them several times. But the trivia questions, extras, and basically everything else, are annoying and badly written. It always seems to me that the major flaw of writers, particularly in the young-adult"
6296,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,Was a good reminder of old artemis days and the story! Suits well for a lazy reading day. Eoin calfer’s humor is the BEST!
6297,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,"A companion book to the Artemis Fowl series. The book contains two short stories: ""LEPrecon"" describes Holly's initiation from Traffic duty to Recon. ""Seventh Dwarf"" follows Mulch Diggums, my favorite Artemis Fowl character, as he and Artemis team up to steal a famous tiara. The rest of the book is comprised of ""notes"" from Artemis Fowl's files on the fairy folk--the fairy code and a key to decode it and interviews with the main charactersare the highlights. Entertaining."
6298,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,"(3,5) I'm happy when finishing a series I find some short stories set in the same universe. If it took me some time to get into the last Artemis Folw's book, I thoroughly enjoyed these two short stories from the start. I loved discovering these little adventures and the little bit of information they gave me. Now I would like to re-read the Fowl's books from the start."
6299,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,"This is a fun addition to the Artemis Fowl canon. Along with character interviews and a catalog of some of Foaly's inventions, there are two short stories. ""LEPrecon,"" the story of how Holly got into recon in the first place, is a good, solid story. Believable plot (believable in this universe of fairies and whatnot), good villain, typical rule-breaking Holly shenanigans. ""The Seventh Dwarf"" is fun, but it feels more like filler than anything else. Granted, Eoin Colfer filler is pretty good fill"
6300,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,"Two new stories from the tales of Artemis Fowl II and his allies have been uncovered, as well as top secret information regarding the various aspects of faerie life, including the workings of Foaly, some confidential interviews with characters, and more! Colfer gives avid fans of this enticing series some fun and informative reading with this short and simple but nonetheless humorous and charming bit of entertaining lore. Keep these files safe, lest the Fowl residence learn you have come across"
6301,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,"I thought the interviews and faerie descriptions were a little contrived, but the short stories themselves were wonderful! How else would Holly earn a spot in LEPrecon without breaking a few rules as she always does? How else would Mulch and Artemis grow to be friends if they weren't pulling off a few heists behind the backs of the LEP?"
6302,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,"In true Artemis Fowl series fashion, I wasn't sure who to root for in the short stories. It was strange to read stories for between books 1 and 2, just because you have to remember everyone still hates everyone. Whoever had this book before me was considerate enough to use pencil in the crosswords."
6303,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,"I love how for all his brilliance and criminal activity, Artemis Fowl is firstly and lastly a little boy who loves his mother :) I liked both of the short stories that were included in this book. We get to read a prequel short story about Holly's initiation and a sequel story in which Mulch Diggums makes a reappearance. The physical anatomy of a dwarf is very intriguing to me."
6304,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,Four stars on the cute short stories that give you a little background a peek into some unseen time during the Artemis Fowl world. The interviews I give three stars. Several of them I liked but for some reason the one with Foaly rubbed me the wrong way. I know self centered but wow I didn't realize how bad. I would have hated his character had I read his interview before the books.
6305,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,"Not too much to say about this one. The Artemis Fowl Files is for the completists amongst fans of the series. It contains two short stories of 76 pages each, and a little activity pack in between. Each of the books in the series also contains a code along the bottom of each page for the wily eyed reader to crack after reading the book - for those who've missed this snippet in the books, this activity pack specifically invites a little code breaking activity and provides the full alphabet to get"

6310,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,"This was such a fun read. “The first female in Recon,” groaned the commander. Holly lowered her face to hide a grin that she couldn’t contain. “You’re going to wash out in six months,” continued Root, “and probably cost me a fortune.” He was wrong about the first, but right about the second.” My admiration for Captain Holly Short grew fonder after reading LEPrecon . Additionally, it was such a nice short story as it challenges the characters's morale and motives, especially Commander Julius R"
6311,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,"The Artemis Fowl Files makes for a fun little addition to the series, which really does fit better as book #1.5 than something to read at the end of the series which is what I did. But then, it is always nice seeing familiar faces we haven’t seen in a long time, too. Holly's initiation to LEPrecon made for a good story, and the end definitely had me laughing out loud - it's so Holly! It also made for a better introduction of Turnball Root, Julius Root’s brother, so he does not come so out o"
6312,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,2,"The Artemis Fowl Files includes two short stories, LEPrecon and The Seventh Dwarf, as well as short interviews with the characters, a guide to the different fairy species, and diagrams of Foaly's inventions. It is nice to see some illustrations with Foaly's work, but the filler section seemed just like that to me, filler. The meat of this book are the short stories. I especially loved LEPrecon as it tells the story of how Holly became the first female recon officer. The Seventh Dwarf is a short"
6313,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,"I expected it to be more boring than what it was, but especially Holly's story was really interesting to read through as it depicts how she got into Recon and establishes her past solidly. Mulch's story on the other hand was a bit too fast and it did not have the same tension, but fun and heartwarming nonetheless. The contents are not that amazing. Apart from the 2 stories, there is information Artemis has gathered, but it seems way too specific to be useful (like basing the traits of an entire r"

I had actually never read these before, but it was kind of cute going back to when they didn't all work together as a cohesive unit after reading further into the book series. I wish I had read it before the seventh book, but too late now! Still, it was a fun and easy read. I'd give it four stars."
6315,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,"The Artemis Fowl Files This book was amazing! I would definitely recommend this book to anybody who likes fiction, fairies, stuff like that. I wish that it would have another short story, but it was amazing as it is."
6316,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,This was a good extra book that told you all about the characters with an inside interview. It had a crossword puzzle and a test determining which type of fairy you were. It also had Artemis' report card and his teacher's evaluations of him in his classes.
6318,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,A couple fun stories from the early Fowl years where things were still interesting and not super convoluted.
6319,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,"A cute set of Artemis Fowl short stories and other short segments (like school reports); if you like the series, you'll enjoy the stories, but they are by no means ""essential"" reading."

6323,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,"It was so nice to return to the world of Artemis Fowl. This book was filled with extras like interviews, games, and short stories. The characters had not changed in the short stories, nor had the settings."

This short story gives us good background on Holly - that underneath her impulsiveness, seeming inability to obey orders and brash jock behaviour,"
6338,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,"The Artemis Fowl Files This book was very interesting to say the least, I was a bit skeptical in the beginning. Mainly because I’m not a big fan of books that have fairies and magic in it, but this book changed my view on that opinion. What kept me reading this book was that I was always wondering what was going to happen next. The story kept me on my toes from the very start; you never knew what was going to happen. The plot of the story probably wasn’t the greatest because it was very simple b"
6340,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,"Actual rating is 3.5. I would highly recommend reading this book after reading Artemis Fowl and The Arctic Incident because there are massive spoilers for both of those books in this one. It's not necessary to read this book to understand the others, but it's good for clarification and information if you're curious or the type of fan who has to know the details or enjoys the details. The reading level is definitely middle-school level, and this book only has two stories: LEPrecon (which gives the"

One called 'LEPrecon' - The story of Captain Holly Short's move from Traffic to Recon, and how she became the first female officer to serve under Commander Julius Root and the other is called Seventh Dwarf. LEPrecon was somewhat of a disappointment. The villain, who has a very interesting background, turns out to be flat in the end and the story was just lacking the usual Fowl smartness and edginess.

It was a blast from the past. There were no spoilers in the book so you could read it if you haven't read the other Artemis Fowl. Still, I enjoyed reading it last. This book was really a blast from the past. It has a bunch of little games in it, which I personally skipped. The reading part was fantastic, though. There were two short stories.

Apart from the stories, there are also a couple of interviews with the main characters, some blueprints of fairy technology and several puzzles. The stories are great, but the puzzles I could have lived without. The biggest fault this book has is that its contents can also be found elsewhere.

6347,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,"I recently had the honor of reading “The Artemis Fowl Files”. It was amazing and descriptive! The Artemis fowl files, which was written by Eoin Colfer, took place mostly every where. This book is action packed and still lies a mystery even I can’t figure out. Any ways , this book was mainly about children trying to figure out about ancient cultures which still were not reveled. I think this was mostly to do with the captains and commander. The main characters were Holly and Root. This book is al"

It was quite interesting, too - I think I liked the first story more than the second but the history side of things is often underplayed in the main sequence so worked well here. This sort of tie-in gets lost when you listen to audio books; a real shame as Nathaniel Parker (who narrates the unabridged novels) does so with such aplomb. It would have been nice if LEPrecon had been included as an audio bonus with The Opal Decept"
6349,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,"Not really sure how to review this book. It has two short stories in it – that sandwich some other pap, which are character profiles and interviews with characters. I’d seen mention to the second story – the eight dwarf – on a website which made me aware of the book. I must say that while I’m writing this – I have no recollection what the first story was about – which either sums up my memory or shows that the story wasn’t particularly memorable. I didn’t really enjoy the supplementary material."

6357,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,I enjoyed the short stories; they were well-developed. The background story of Holly Short being initiated into the LEPrecon unit was especially meaningful. It further deepens the overall relationships in the Artemis Fowl world. I loved the silly interviews. “What keeps you awake at night?” Part of the answer Artemis gives is he sometimes feels bad about the things he has done but gets past the guilt when he checks his bank account balance. One of Butler’s questions was “What is your favorite bo
6358,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,"Not really all that important to the core series. It would have been better if there were some tidbits that would pop up later in the series but honestly it feels like it was written as an after thought, or just random loose end story ideas that never developed into anything. I did like Hollys story as a prequel but the Seventh Dwarf, although fun, just seemed kinda an obsolete story in the long run. I actually would have loved it if Holly wasn't involved in that story and the little heist was b"

There are two full stories here - Holly Short's initiation into LEPRecon, and Mulch and Artemis's first job together. There are also interviews with characters (and with the author), plans for Foaly's inventions and some other extras and simple activities for readers. The full stories add strong detail to the main story; the first one clarifies who Turnball Root is, exactly how crazy he is and why he has such a grudge against Holly and his brother; it"

Although it's entirely supplementary, in a weird way I think this was my favourite book of the series. You definitely can't appreciate it without having read the others, but I found it was the one that I had the longest-lasting affection for. This book is pretty much what you'd expect, containing notes, diagrams, and maps relating to the series along with a couple short stories about the characters' other adventures.

Crosswords, find a words, codes (which I admit weren't so bad), interviews, species biographies, and diagrams. The interviews were nothing special. The biographies only revolve around one particular character (e.g, centaur=Foaly, elf=Holly).

The Artemis Fowl Files does exactly what it's supposed to do–a yummy snack while we wait for the last Artemis Fowl book. I must admit that I did not enjoy the interviews and other activities as much as I enjoyed the two short stories; however, I can see how readers who love the Fairy world even more than I do could find the interviews and other activities quite fun.

I immediately used it to read the inscriptions on the bottom of each of the books (I know... Im a nerd...). It was really fun.

There are two short stories, interviews with the characters, and illustrations. My rating is based on the short stories. One story is about Holly joining the Recon unit and the other story is earlier in this series. The second story is an adventure with Artemis and Mulch. Both stories are excellent and bring forth the enjoyment of this series. If you like the Artemis Fowl books you will probably enj"
6368,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,"This book almost didn't even need to be published. Its only real interesting parts were Holly's initiation and the interviews. Everything was rather unsurprising (we already knew everything, just restated from earlier published books and the fairy code was only for those who couldn't figure it out already or were too lazy to) and Mulch's story added nothing really. It wasn't like Mulch lacked presence in previous or coming novels, and the story gave no new information. It felt like a silly activ"
6369,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,"Basically the official Fowl field guide, The Artemis Fowl Files is a must-read for any Artemis fan. Not only including bonus material, it contains two short stories. The first story is about Corporal Short's raise to Captain, the second is an operation involving a Fei Fei tiara, seven drawfs, and a criminal boy genius, plus the back-up of billions of dollars worth in fairy technology! Bonus material includes a fairy field guide, character interviews, Artemis' report card, a Gnommish translator, a"
6370,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,"I've listened to all the Bowl books. I don't think there's an audiobook of this one. It really wouldn't work as one. It's a short quick read. About 190 pages or so. If you've read the series, or listened to it as I have, it adds some background info about a few characters. But it really kinda feels more like info that was simply left out of the other books at some point in time and then discovered laying around in an old file, slapped into a new book and published. If you're a fan of Arty and the"
6371,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,"Two short stories. One is before the first book and the second one is after the first book. Neither takes away from reading the first. Artemis is a criminal mastermind, genius, science geek, rich, and only 12 years old. He is the anti-Harry Potter. Somehow I feel though he's not all that bad. I've already began reading the first book. As a friend at work and I are both reading these stories. Its fun to read the same book as someone you know. This is a YA/Teen book but it is very much a fun read."
6372,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,2,"This book was okay. I didn't exactly dislike it, but I didn't really like it too much either. It's been a few years since I read my last Artemis Fowl book, and to be honest, I don't really remember a whole lot about them. I feel like the books in general are not memorable for me. I know I had fun reading them, and I know I (mostly) liked the characters, but the books really aren't anything special. This one had two very short stories. The stories didn't draw me in, I mostly just kept reading to ge"
6373,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,"Two short stories show how Holly became a LEP officer and follows one of Artemis's schemes, along with interviews with the characters. These stories serve as bonus material, and definitely shouldn't be read unless otherwise familiar with the series. But they do examine two of the characters and shed some light on their characters. Holly is the only female LEP officer, and it was an uphill climb to get there. Her story showed how her quick thinking and ingenuity got her her place. The other story"
6374,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,"I bought this book because of the cover (and because Artemis is my internet alter ego). I'm not being absolutely true. I bought Artemis Fowl (the first book of the series) because i liked this books cover. I still love to play with the magnet that runs along the fold. The short stories are nice, but I don't really see them fit in the other books chronology. But they are nice back stories, and they fit the characters well. The rest of the stuff in the book is already available on the internet page and"
6375,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,"I'm so glad that I found another Artemis Fowl book to read! I was so sad when I finished the last one, but then I found out about this one and the 4 graphic novels! I'll have to get my hands on those. This book was great. It has two short stories, as well as descriptions of all the fairies, interviews with the main characters, and a key to the Gnommish language. Now I can decode the messages in all the other books, which I am trying to collect so I can own them and read them over and over and OV"
6376,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,"I picked up this for a short fun read, and it certainly was the first line had me laughing. It was great to get back into the world of Holly Short and Artimis Fowl and remember all the other hilarious things they did. This book had two short stories in it and some other amusing 'interviews' and bits and pieces. You will definitely want to have read at least the first book before reading this one otherwise there would be big spoilers. I have no problem with the content in this book at all mostly"
6377,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,"This was a very quick read as it's 2 short stories and some game type stuff. I'd describe it as basically an activity book with two short stories and a few page or two long ""interviews"" as well as a few pages describing the faerie creatures. I enjoyed both the short stories immensely. The first one has to do with how Holly moved up from traffic to recon as well as what Commander Root's brother did and HOW he wound up in jail. It was a pretty great story to read. The second story was a heist story"
6378,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,"I enjoyed this story (or rather, 2 short stories) and it reminded me of how much I enjoyed the Artemis Fowl series as a whole. Interesting characters and an imaginative plot with all the fairy technology etc. In terms of added extras in this book they seemed a bit young for me but entertaining none the less, I loved the character 'interviews' especially the one of Artemis Fowl, it was plausible for his character and quiet funny."
6379,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,"A nice little taste for fans of Artemis Fowl. The short stories are both solid, well-paced and without the overstrained humor that plagued some of the later books in the series. The other content is kind of hit-or-miss; I appreciated the illustrations of the pod and helmet, but I could have mostly done without the interviews (except for Butler's). Not particularly substantial, but a fun little extra."
6380,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,2,"This is basically just an Artemis Fowl add-on, though worth a read if you're a fan of the series (you can usually find it in bargain bins, or for cheap online). It's got character bios and interviews, as well as some short stories and a few puzzles (there was a crossword in there, I think), all dedicated to the Fowl-verse. Not bad, really, but not appropriate for someone who wants something with real plot and action."
6381,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,i loved this book. The Artemis fowl files was one of the best books I have read. The book was about how Holly Short was a corporal and she was trying to become a recon until these one Elvs kidnapped her and others who were going to the test to see if she had what it takes to be a recon. But then they said if you try to run away we will hurt and maybe kill one of your friends. The only way Holly and her friends were going to escape is if her boss gave them a ton of 24 carat gold jewlery.
6382,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,"A fun little book, written between The Eternity Code and The Opal Deception, it explains all about the Elves, includes interviews with the key players, and especially nice, gives the key to the elvish alphabet so you can decode all the elvish writing on the pages of the Artemis Fowl books. Several short stories are included. We find out how Holly got her acorns, and have a bit of fun with Mulch Diggums."
6383,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,2,The first short story is really good! It tells the story of how Holly got to be the first female LEP officer ever. It's a 4 stars story. The second story... It has to much Artemis and I just don't like Artemis. I can see that he will probably get better but right now? He's just a little know it all (or so he thinks)... It's a 2.5 stars story. The interviews are just to fill some space in the book... So they're a 1.5 stars...
6384,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,"This book is part stories, part Artemis Fowl universe info. Inside, you get the fairy alphabet (which kinda made me sad because I liked that I decoded it without help!), some guides to the different races of fairies, and some other odds and ends, plus little one-shot stories about the characters you know and love. Want to know how Holly basically got into Recon on a bet? It's a hilarious story and I love Holly so much."
6385,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,"This is a cool field guide to Artemis Fowl, and I enjoyed it. I was personally annoyed that they included the decoded fairy language, as my friend and I spent several hours decoding the fairy code using the actual code and the translation, then translating the entire bottom of the first book. It was painstaking, but worth it, and it bothers me that other people can do the exact same thing by looking at a couple of page in that book. Otherwise, a fun read if you have enjoyed Artemis Fowl."
6386,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,"I liked the short stories and the extras, such as Artemis's report card and the fairy language. The reader gets a better understanding of the characters, which is always good, because the stories take place in ""normal"" situations. It does have the main problem of a supplementary book in that much of the information is not new and is just pulled straight from the series. Luckily, there's not too much of it."
6387,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,2,"I've liked all of the Artemis Fowl books but this companion piece didn't feel like an Artemis Fowl story. I enjoyed the Seventh Dwarf, mainly because Mulch Diggums is always entertaining. Everything else felt flat and forced, however. The interviews, the diagrams...it wasn't anything that couldn't be included in or explained by one of the main stories. I'd much rather have a new Artemis Fowl book to read!"
6388,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,"If you are an Artemis Fowl fan or simple read the Artemis Fowl series, you may want to pick up this book. It is a nice companion to all the great Artemis Fowl books and gives us in depth files of each of the characters in Artemis Fowl. Pick it up if you wish for more of an insight on the characters' backgrounds."
6389,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,I think this book was a good one because this book was about all kinds of action and fairy tales this book was great about many other things like how the monsters and other fairy tales charaters were in the in hole story all of the monsters are after a code to unlock something like a door way or something else like other monsters and other fairy tales.
6390,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,2,"Nice background info on Holly and Mulch. The true gem in this collection is Artemis' school report - he choses alternate days to give wrong answers to teach his teachers about chaos theory, lol. On the other end of the spectum: The 'interviews' with the characters were just so painfully stereotypical - I'm clearly too old for this stuff now."
6391,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,2,"I didn't like it much because of the ""Seventh Dwarf"". The stories in it are quite good. But Eoin Colfer missed a spot. The Seventh Dwarf takes place between the Artic Incident and the first book. And yet, the dialogue in the Artic Incident clashes with what is written in the Artemis Fowl files, and basically ruined it for me."
6392,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,"if you have read Artemis Fowl series and you have some questions in your mind,this book can answer them. It has 2 new but short stories in it and also a lot of other texts. I really liked this book.my favorite short story in this book is the seventh dwarf,I also liked the interviews and Foaly's inventions."
6393,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,"Have you ever wanted to be able to read a symbolic language? Besides the short stories (which are so much fun for a quick read), I really loved getting the codes for the language translation. At the bottom of each Artemis Fowl book is another story written in one of the fairy languages, The Artemis Fowl Files will help you translate it! Really great for kids of all ages."
6394,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,"This was more of a short stories and stat book than anything else. I found the character interview section hilarious. By far Butler and Mulch Diggums are my favorite characters in the series, with Holly and Artemis in a tied second. These short stories fill in the holes that were left in the story from the third book on. Cheers and Happy Reading!"
6395,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,2,"Eoin Cofer’s Artemis Fowl series reminded me how much I love a good fantasy series. He sucks the reader in and weaves a story that does not let go, making for a non-stop reading fest like only a good fantasy novel can supply. My only regret is that I only became aware of the series when I had already grown up and had to suffer the weird stares that people give to adults reading YA material."
6396,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,"It wasn't quite as fascinating as I was hoping it would be - not to mention the What Magical Race Are You quiz (or whatever it's called) is rigged. I couldn't get anything other than human, and I was hoping for at least a sprite or centaur. C'mon. But still, it's Artemis Fowl. It has a worthy place on my Favorites shelf."
6397,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,"For an 'extras' book, this is downright amazing. There's NEW stuff in it, which, I don't have to tell you how rare that is. In summary: two short stories, interviews with the main characters, Artemis's school report, the Gnommish alphabet and some general info about different aspects of the Fairy world. My only problem is that I am greedy and want even more stuff :("
6398,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,"It was wonderful to get some of the back story behind Holly and Julius' encounter with Turnball as well as Artemis' shenanigans with Mulch after the whole fairy gold incident. There were other interesting profiles in there too, and I liked the part with the interviews with the main characters. I liked getting the stories not ""officially"" told :)"
6399,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,"This is a weird ""guide to"" book with some diagrams and interviews with characters and blurbs on the language and whatnot. But there are a couple stories in it too! The story about Holly Short's experience in trying out for Recon is hilarious and awesome, and the extra information is fun. Did I mention I love this guy?"
6400,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,"It was so fun to get lost in this world again and learn more about Artemis, Mulch, Butler, Holly, and everyone else! I adore books like this and it was such a fun, quick read. I wish it had been longer! Mr. Colfer has such an imagination and this book was proof of that. I would read this again any day. It was funny, well written, and engaging. easily 5 out of 5 stars."
6401,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,"I love Artemis Fowl. I really do. Although the last book was relatively disappointing, I still love the series, and this book reminded me of that. I admit, I mostly skimmed the ""reference"" material, and I skipped Mulch's short story because I don't like him, but the other short stories were totally worth it."
6402,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,It was good. I read the series a number of years ago and completely enjoyed it. It was neat to find this book and get some in between and back stories on the Artemis Fowl gang and find out some new adventures. I didn't like the last half of the book that had the interviews with the characters. They didn't seem genuine.
6403,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,"Gee, this might sound creepy... I can read Gnommish now! This book has a code in it for the bottoms and/or covers of the rest of the books that are written in the Fairy language. ""Carry me always carry me well. I am thy teacher of herb and spell. I am thy link to power arcane. Forget me and thy magick shall wane."" :P"
6404,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,*3.4 Light-hearted. Easier than the formal books in the series. A nice change from the tense and thrilling Artemis Fowl. Funny and interesting to read the character interviews. Normally I dislike these small guides in between a series yet I enjoyed The Artemis Fowl Files . I can now learn how to write Gnommish!
6405,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,It is so fun reading this series with my son. I did not know that this was short stories and I was left wanting. We get a glimpse into Corporal Short’s intro to LEP and a short intro to a great villain that just never developed into a climax that I was anticipating. It is really hard to review something like this just not sure what to say other than it was enjoyable.
6406,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,2,"A frustrating companion to the series that includes some mediocre short stories. The stories carry none of the charm or wit of the series and feel loose and oversimplified. Skip this. I haven't bothered to translate the Gnommish at the bottom of the pages and read it, so I can't speak for that though."
6407,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,The two little stories in the book were cute. I like Holly's back story best. It's just good to know how she became the first female to get in and all that. There were some great activities in there for kids and it even has the first alphabet in there for those who didn't work it out when reading the first book.
6408,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,"I really enjoyed this book. The middle information was cute, I didn't really pay to much attention to it but the two short stories really caught my attention. They really added to the plot and story of the Artemis Fowl series and I loved the suspense and surprises they carried. The epilogue of ""The Seventh Dwarf"" was just cherry on the cake."
6409,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,Overall 3.5* This one is about Holly's initiation into LEP's recon unit and another short story involving Artemis and Mulch Diggums. Also carries interviews of all the main characters of this series and characteristics of the various creatures of the fairy world. Must read for fans of this series.
6410,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,"In the short story ""The 7th Dwarf,"" (set before ""The Artic Incident"") Artemis meets Mulch, contradicting the premise in ""The Artic Incident"" that that was when they first met. Otherwise, an excellent mini-adventure. As well as the other short story, ""LEPrecon,"" Holly's initiation. All the other little extras were cool, too."
6411,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,"This book includes a couple sections of stories that, I think, were written for special events or something - anyway, stories that are like side stories and not found in any of the real books. It was a really fast read, and I really enjoyed the quick tales. I even enjoyed the silly interviews with characters and extras in the book."
6412,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,"It won't be interesting if you aren't an Artemis Fowl fan, but I quite enjoyed it (since Artemis Fowl, Butler, Holly Short and Mulch Diggums are some of my favorite characters of all time). It is the first Artemis Fowl book that I read rather than listened to, and I find I like him in writing just as much as audio book."
6413,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,Very Short and enlightening read that adds some depth to the Artemis Fowl series. The best parts of this book are the two short stories included in this book. The first one is about Holly shorts initiation into the LEP-recon division. The second story features Artemis Fowl and the dwarf Mulch teaming up for a jewel heist.
6414,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,"The Seventh Dwarf reminded me of the younger, more cunning Artemis. Definitely enjoyed the back story about how Holly got her first acorns. Too bad the notes didn't include descriptions of No1's species as well. A neat companion to the Artemis Fowl series."
6415,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,"The two bonus stories in this book were fun to read. I'm a big fan of Holly Short, and she was important in both stories. There is some helpful info about the difference between fairies, pixies, dwarfs, trolls, etc. for those who might confuse them sometimes."
6416,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,"This must have been written early on in the series. I don't think it's worth as much as the eight series books, but it was good. I liked that it filled in some gaps left from the first couple books. Kinda weird that it has a word search in the middle."
6417,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,"I found this collection after completing the series. It was nice to be reminded of several books back in my memory. These shorts stories are great vignettes that deepen the characters' background and personality. Honestly, I wouldn't mind a collection of more."
6418,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,2,"This a complementary book for the Artemis Fowl series. It has two short stories, one with Holly and the other one with Mulch and Artemis, they are both good but there's nothing special about them, read it if you really like those characters."
6419,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,"Do not read it this book if you didn't finish with the first three books of the Artemis Series. It had crosswords and word search. His report card was my favorite part of the book. It showed his personality so much!!! It's very interesting, so start reading this book!!!! :)"
6420,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,"Doesn't compare to other books in the series, but a good read nonetheless. I enjoyed the interviews with the characters and the author at the end. Funny how Opal Koboi and other stuff was mentioned a couple of times in there."
6421,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,"A cute short story which serves as a prequel to the Artemis Fowl series, it describes how Holly Short came to be the first female LEPrecon agent. Merged review: Two short stories from the Artemis Fowl universe."
6422,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,"I enjoyed all the extra bits and the short stories, but Colfer could've included so much more. I've read other books similar to this one for other series that were much better done. Overall, I'm glad I read it and the parts I enjoyed were very good, but it could've been a lot better."
6425,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,"It was nice to see a couple of background stories in this book, but it sort of peters out when you get to the interview parts. It would have been more satisfying to have the miscellaneous parts first."
6426,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,2,In enjoy the Artemis Fowl series and these were just 2 short stories which were a fun and a quick read. I also liked the book because it had a lot of drawings about certain pieces of fairy technology that were fun to see.
6427,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,"A short story about how Holly got her job and another about what Mulch Diggums did after the events of book 1. Both are entertaining enough, though neither is necessary. There's also some miscellaneous junk of questionable interest."
6428,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,Nothing that I hadn't decoded before (specifically talking about the Gnomish alphabets). It is not updated (as in with the latest novel - the Atlantis Complex) and I say this isn't really a required reading if you're a fan of the Fowl series. Just leaf through it.
6429,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,"Nice companion book for Artemis Fowl's series, while we waiting impatiently for the final book, Book 8 (Last Guardian) next year. It contains 2 short stories and tidbits on AF series main characters. I never can get enough of this series, too bad it will end soon :')"
6430,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,"What a great bit of fun! If you love the Artemis Fowl series this is a must-read...two short stories plus diagrams and illustrations explaining everything you've wondered about. The first short story is a prequel, the second short story takes place between the first and second books."
6431,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,"I started reading Artimus fowl to help Brevin(my 9 yr old) get in to them. I have to say I am really enjoying them. They are fun,and I think they have some good lessons about integrity and selfishness."
6432,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,"2 short stories: LEPrecon and The Seventh Dwarf, one about Holly becoming the first female in Recon and one about Mulch Diggums working with Artemis. In between the 2 stories are some interviews and diagrams."
6433,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,"Not as interesting as I had hoped. The stories are good, but again not as good as I was expecting when I ordered it. More fun than entertaining, some interesting interviews and little games. Possibly something a huge Artemis Fowl fan would enjoy, really."
6434,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,"I love Artemis Fowl. Artemis Fowl is Perfect Novel!!! And all I want to tell u... ""Just Read it!"" To. Eoin Colfer YOU'RE GREAT!!!! From. RedharinG (Foever Fan's)"
6435,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,A clever guide to the Artemis Fowl Books
6436,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,Great juvie lit. Really enjoyed the fun world and characters were a hoot. Fun read! Especially good for tween boys but as an adult it was also diverting enough.
6437,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,The stories are the only thing that makes this worth reading. They are quick paced and action packed. The interviews and whatnot are pointless.
6438,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,Good book I read in primary school.
6439,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,"Yay, it has a translation key! And the short stories are really good."
6441,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,"I love this book almost as much as the actual series of Artemis Fowl all n' all, this is another masterpiece of Eoin Colfer's"
6442,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,"This was a great book, but the activities in it were WAY easy and the extra stories weren't all that interesting to me. Good thing was that I learned a new language!"
6443,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,a long time i ago i read this remember nearly nothing
6444,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,This is kind of a fun guide to the series--you need to have read at least the first book in the series before this one will make any sense.
6445,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,"Very commercial book. Fun little stories in it, but not very intriguing like the full-length books are. It is a fun read, but not much more than that."
6446,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,Short story quick read ... as opposed to the longer books that were a quick read. I guess now I can let Z have the kindle back so she can read them herself?
6447,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,Interesting collection of stories of the great Artemis Fowl.
6448,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,I really likes the extra short stories in it.
6449,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,2,"Also a book to pass some time, not bad certainly (not great either)"
6450,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,It seems to me that this book is meant to be read between the third and fourth books of the Artemis Fowl series.
6451,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,2,"the two short stories were cute. not as satisfying as any of the books, but cute."
6453,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,An amazing series with great characters. The protagonist is very cleverly written. A great series I would recommend to anyone!
6454,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,"I L.O.V.E.D. this book! I should have probably read this before I finished the series but still, it made a fantastic read!"
6455,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,I always have this in my bag. *laughs*
6456,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,When you are hungry for more you turn to whatever you can. He brings up many parts of the character lives you would not have had in the books. I liked it.
6457,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,"If you like Artemis Fowl, you will like the stories it contains and the extra information about the Fairy people. It is a quick little read and fun."
6458,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,"Happy to find the out-of-print ""The Seventh Dwarf"" in here. Nice additional materials to go with the first Artemis book."
6459,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,"This is a fun little book with a few stories, like how Holly gets into her job. It gives more info and is fun."
6460,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,Really enjoyed learning how Holly became the first female officer.
6462,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,2,can't match up to the series.
6463,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,Some interesting back story about Holly Short.
6464,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,Eion Colfer's erapting style of writing makes the paranormal seem normal/plausible.
6465,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,2,"I might up the score to 2.5. I really liked the short stories, but the other extras just didn't interest me."
6466,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,"The short stories are good, and so are the interviews and the only bad thing was the quiz."
6467,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,"really good, I like the Artemis Fowl novel, he's not your average villian."
6468,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,I love Artemis Fowl
6469,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,this book teaches you gnommish!!
6470,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,Page random. So I am not reading this book in order and because it's a spinoff- handbook I have the right to. My innerthought is MULCH MAN THIS IS ARTEMIIS THE GUY WHO ALMOST KILLED YEH!!!!
6471,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,"This book is a fun, quick companion to the Artemis Fowl series. There's nothing groundbreaking here, but nothing terrible either. If you're a fan of the series, you'll probably enjoy it."
6472,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,Part of series
6474,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,"I learned nothing really new from this book, except the wonderful fact that I can finally read Gnommish. Quite a disappointment, actually. :("
6475,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,"This was just a fun read. I enjoyed some of the silly journal entries and fun comments that are made. It is also fun to learn about their perspectives, and character's personalities a little more."
6476,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,A great follow-up to the first book. Includes small puzzles with two extra stories that compliment the first book.
6477,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,this book is sooooooo awesome my friend got this and briefly let look at it it shows you how to read and write gnommish!
6478,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,"an amazing series, love the characters and the cliffhangers and twist leave readers begging, pleading, demanding, more :)"
6479,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,"You don't have to have read any of the other books, so it take a lot of explaining in the beginning and wastes pages on it"
6481,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,There are some good short stories and info.
6482,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,Loved the interviews!
6483,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,"“Who or what inspires you?"" ""I must admit that I often read my own articles in scientific journals and inspire myself.”"
6486,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,"Two short stories that give a little background with a few fun puzzles thrown in. Quick and to the point, yet help the readers know more about the world below us."

6495,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,Awesome little side piece on Artemis
6496,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,"This is the best book ever(if you read the series)!!!! There is a gnommish alphabet, a ""fairy quiz"", and 2 short(but amazing) stories!"
6497,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,The two short stories were good. The other things were meant for youthful artemis fans including the code for his special alphabet. I was mainly curious about just what was in the diaries.
6498,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,This book gave very in depth information behind the developement of the artemis fowl series and included various extras that grabbed my interest.
6499,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,I really enjoy the Artemis Fowl books. These are two short stories that give a little background. Fun.
6500,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,"I loved most of the short stories, but what really sealed the deal for me was the decoder for the fairy language. I've decoded the bottom of every book now, and many of them still make me laugh."
6501,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,"Collection of short stories, interviews with characters and the author, designs of equipment, and even a crossword puzzle. An Artemis Fowl fan, I particularly enjoyed the short stories."
6502,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,I love this book it's a good addition to the series.
6503,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,An interesting insight into the Artemis Fowl series. Thanks for writing this short in-between kind of dossier. :-)

6509,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,I HAVE READ ALL THE ARTEMIS FOWL BOOKS AND THEY ALL ROCK!!!! EVERYBODY SHOULD READ THEM!!!!
6510,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,to me l think the needed more important things in the novel
6511,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,This provides some helpful insight to the lives of the Artemis Fowl characers.
6512,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,Not what I thought it would be...
6513,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,"Amusing, perfect for some light reading. If you have a pre-teen or teen on your Christmas list this would make a great stocking stuffer."
6514,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,i learned how to write in gnomish and now i use it all the time
6515,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,Wrote a paper book report.
6516,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,Combo deluxe!!! I LOVED THIS AND WOULD HAVE LOVE IT MORE IF IT WAS LONGER. Oh well... Recommended for everyone!!!
6517,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,2,"two decent short stories about holly and mulch, otherwise not much to it."
6519,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"Jorg Ancrath, you little fucker. My feelings towards Jorg and this book can be best described as the epitome of an abusive relationship. Jorg is not a nice man. Actually, for most of the book, he's 14 years old, so fuck the ""nice man"" part because he's not even a man yet. But he'll rip your head off, quite literally, if you say that to his face. He is a rapist. A murderer. He tortures. He kills haphazardly. He is destructive, capricious. A madman in every sense of the word. He will wound you, ph"
6520,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"""I read the small forgotten books. The ones found behind the rows on the shelves. In locked chests. In pieces to be assembled. They look old. Some are--a hundred years, three hundred, maybe five, but Orrin's are most ancient. Mine though, they look older, as if what is written in them takes its toll, even on parchment and leather. Mine were set down after the Burning, after the Builders ignited their many suns."" I first met Jorg Ancrath in the first book of The Broken Empire called Prince of Thor"
6521,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,2,"2.5/5 Stars A lot of reader and fans claimed King of Thorns to be the best out of the Broken Empire trilogy, it pained me to do so but I can’t agree with that notion. I’m going to inform you right from the beginning of my review, there's an innocent dog torture scene in this book and I’ll admit that part was quite tough to read. However, this doesn’t mean that the scene itself isn’t important to the overarching story, there’s a reason behind this scene. It’s really well written and in my opinion,"
6522,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,
6523,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"I think this is my favorite book in an excellent trilogy, because the odds are so severely against our anti-hero Jorg. The stakes are high and the plot twists are perfect. Having killed his uncle and secured a small kingdom in the mountains, young Jorg now faces a powerful, charismatic enemy – the Prince of Arrow – who seems destined to unite the Broken Empire. The action jumps back in forth in time, from the siege of Jorg’s capital to several years before, showing us how Jorg traveled the empir"
6524,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"(06/09) King of Thorns? Probably the best of all SO. MANY. FEELS. Do you know what I love in these books? Picture the perfect hero. Kind. Skilled. Supported by all kind of prophecies. See this guy, the perfect Gary Sue of fantasy? Well, here, you root for the other guy who wants to kill him . Because Jorg is some kind of anti Knight in Shining Armor.

6525,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,1,"Unpopular opinion time! There are some brilliant anti-heroes in the realms of fiction. Anthony Burgress’ Alex from A Clockwork Orange and Byron’s Don Juan immediately spring to mind. In both cases, the characters are undeniably flawed and twisted; they exploit the world, and other people, to meet their own ends: they are egotistical bastards with little (to no) scruples. Mark Lawrence’s Jorg Ancrath is no different; he is a nasty piece of work who lives simply for himself. There’s nothing wrong w"
6526,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"Sometimes the world slows and you notice every small thing, as if you stood between two beats of eternity’s heart.(...) The air hung heavy with the metallic scent of rain. I wondered: if I stood out there, in the flood, would the rain wrap a grey life and make it shine? Should I stand, arms spread, and raise my face? Let it wash me clean. Or did my stains run too deep? Err… * picks up the jaw from the floor* Wow! This book is in an entirely different league than Prince of Thorns. So many layers, s"
6527,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,3,"Originally reviewed at Bookwraiths Reviews __________________________________________ 2015 UPDATE AFTER FINISHING THE TRILOGY In the below review, I had many criticisms about the story, specifically how Jorg seemingly produced ""super-powers"" out of thin air to save himself. While that is exactly how I felt after closing King , Emperor of Thorns satisfactorily explained those aspects of the story, so when reading this review, please understand many of my criticisms were later made moot by Mr. Lawren"
6528,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"As good as the first? Not quite but I still really liked it. The story is told from three points of view, Jorg's present as he faces a massive army set to destroy him, flash back four years as Jorg tries to discover the origins of a mysterious copper box that seems to have stolen some of his memories, and finally the journal entries of Katherine Jorg's love interest. At times I found this bouncing back and forth confusing but I'm pretty sure it was only because of how slowly I was forced to read"
6529,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"If you regularly follow my reviews, you must have already noticed that nice out of ten times I don't get to enjoy the next installments in a series as much as the first one (probably due to the fact that I'm already acquainted with the world & character building, as well as the magic system, so i am less impressed by the rest of the story). King of Thorns is the exception to the ""rule"". The one out of ten. ""Fifteen! I'd hardly be fifteen and rousting villages. By the time fifteen came around,"
6530,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"Mark Lawrence stormed onto the scene (well, as much as you can in the publishing world) last year with his debut, Prince of Thorns , book one in The Broken Empire. This divisive book found a fan in me, despite this particular first person point of view that all notions of good and virtue tells you to hate. I found a lot of things that I liked about Jorg even though I didn't love everything about him. Lawrence's captivating writing and smooth prose keep the pages flying and have not a little to do"
6531,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"With my reading time becoming increasingly precious, only the very best authors make it to my reading pile at all, and of those, I went with Lawrence to read after finally finishing edits to The Daylight War. Lawrence's poetic prose is amazing, far and away the best of the modern fantasy authors. The prose can get a little hard to follow if you're sleepy or your brain is fried after a long day, but this is hardly a quibble. First person narrative is arguably the most difficult POV style, and Lawr"
6532,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"""The warrior rides a black stallion. Smoke shrouds the castle ruins behind him and the wind gives only glimpses of the corpse-choked gap between high and broken walls. That same wind streams long dark hair across his shoulders, like a pennant, and flutters the remnants of his cloak. To his left and right more riders emerge from the fog of war, warriors all, their armour dented, torn, smeared with soot and blood."" Honourous Jorg Ancrath, the Prince of Thorns, has become a king in his own right, an"
6533,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"This month I am recommending both PRINCE OF THORNS and KING OF THORNS by Mark Lawrence. They are two of three, with the third not yet published. I have read the first and am halfway through the second. As a fantasy tale, Prince Jorg Ancraft's story is quite extraordinary. It begins when he is 13 and already a stone cold killer with a horrific past. This is a dangerous and risky protagonist for any author to put forth, but Lawrence does it with verve and confidence. It is like a train wreck from"
6534,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"The most interesting thing I took away from this book was that I started to like Jorg, albeit just a bit , more. He still does reprehensible things, don't get me wrong, but he's older and wiser and not so eager to jump in and kill people without asking questions first. He strategizes a great deal more as well and really tries to think many steps ahead of his opponents. Jorg actually seems to be bothered when certain people are hurt or die, instead of just forgetting them and moving on. He thinks"
6535,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"King of Thorns (#2 Broken Empire) by Mark Lawrence. Hmm, What to say about this Author and this series, without spoiling any of the twists or surprises. Book one, Prince of Thorns was one of the surprises of 2011. If you didn't get it on your to do list you should add it now. I'll wait while you do. Ok? Done? At it's essence, this series is a VERY dark and violent tale, told first person, from the point of view of Jorg the young and disturbed ringleader of a brutal band of wandering misfits (Bro"
6536,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,2,"I don't want to be harsh and all, but all I can say of King of Thorns would be that it was fucking boring. It's a shame compared to Prince of Thorns. The plot's utterly full of useless shit. This novel could've been way shorter. It has 500+ pages (on my iPad) and most of the novel was full of useless conversations. It also has too much adjectives, and tends to describe things longer than it should. And where the fuck is the action? I really liked the first book because it was full of violence"
6537,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"This second book in the Broken Empire series was of a similar quality to the first. Which means it was pretty good! The Story This story picks up 4 years after the end of the first book. An 18 year old Jorg now sits on the throne of Renar, but still dreams of being Emperor. His main competition for the role, the beloved Prince of Arrow, marches on Jorg's kingdom with an army many times that of Renar. In a fair fight there would only be one winner. Fighting fair has never been part of Honorous Jor"
6539,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,3,"THE SOCIOPATH IS AT IT AGAIN While I despised Jorg in Prince of Thorns, the story itself was highly entertaining and kept me turning pages as quickly as I could read them.  However, I did not find this novel as engrossing, perhaps because I've grown somewhat use to the main character's sociopathic behavior. In any event, since the ""shock"" value of Jorg didn't overwhelm me this go round, I found myself focusing a great deal on the story itself, which quite honestly was a bit underwhelming.  I co"
6540,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"Well, I’m pleased to say that I am pleasantly surprised at my feelings towards this book. Upon first reading I didn’t much care for it at all. I didn’t like Jorg, I didn’t care for his brothers and I got overly confused by the different timelines in this book. Couple that with my tendency to read rather quickly and I was left rather underwhelmed. However, upon my re-read 4 years later my opinions have changed somewhat. Don’t get me wrong, I still didn’t much care for Jorg’s brothers. I don’t fee"
6542,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"King Jorg somehow finds a way to make you root for him as a reader despite his brutality. He is bold, rash, relentless, ruthless and shameless in pursuit of power and vengeance. I love falling in love with the characters and King Jorg Ancrath. I have to say it only got better in the second installment. and now on to the next book."
6543,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"The Broken Empire is a trilogy that I was absolutely afraid to even touch, due to reviews about how violent and gritty it is, and because of rape scenes that are really hard to read about. It's been on my to-read list for a long time as I found the story quite intriguing but all these comments about rape sensitive issues put me off. It was when I read a short story by Mark Lawrence in Unfettered and then the Sleeping Beauty. I loved the atmosphere and ML's wonderful prose in the short stories so I"
6544,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"This was really good. I loved that there were mainly two different storylines in different times (four years ago and wedding day). Also, since Jorg himself did not know his own plan and what happened in the past we got to figure it out together. I am surprised that I like Jorg. He really comes off as the villain most of the time but still I feel sorry for him and also really want him to win the war and become Emperor. In any case, now I need to get my hands on the third book cause I am curious t"
6545,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"Prince of Thorns impressed the hell out of me. Jorg Ancrath is the best kind of protagonist: flawed, stumbling, sometimes evil. He's human, and has that greatest of human capacities: the ability to make mistakes, learn from them, and drag the world forward with him. Jorg doesn't disappoint in the 2nd installment in the series. If anything, his sharp wit, dark perceptive humor and almost precognizant read of complex situations develops. Lawrence ups the stakes in King of Thorns, and takes a comple"
6546,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"In King of Thorns Jorg of Ancrath takes the next step on his path to power. Again author Mark Lawrence shows us the becoming of a villain and as Jorg matures the story does as well. First time readers beware, this review will most likely to contain spoilers for Prince of Thorns. As in his first novel, Mark Lawrence divides the narrative into two timelines. The first timeline starts immediately after the concluding events of Prince of Thorns and shows us what Jorg and his Brothers are up to for th"
6547,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"I liked this one even more than the first. There are a lot of surprises as the world gets more and more flushed out. Jorg is a unique character, and the end is great - when you find out what's going on inside him, and how Katherine and Sageous fit into it.. and how he's poised to live the next phase of his life. I can't wait to finish the series. My only complaint is that it felt a little disjointed at times, with about half of it being a flashback, and half being Jorg's present day. I think it w"
6548,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"Mark Lawrence accustomed his readers to a tale swinging wildly between the now and the past. This is how he crafts his stories and he surely knows how to do this. I mean swinging. And also, wildly. Thus, we meet Jorg on his wedding day . He is eighteen, a young man, hundreds of days stand between him and the revenge-obsessed kid thinking of gutting every second person that crosses his path. He is reshaped but not broken, he is burnt but not burned out and he is getting married but not to the woma"
6549,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"Even better than the first! More action more emotion. Amazing character development! I highly suggest you pick up this series if you haven't already! I can't wait to devour the final book though I'll be sad to see this story end. ""A dark time comes. My Time. If it offends you. Stop me."""
6550,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"I know this may sound odd since this is such a dark book, but I actually laughed out loud several times while reading this book. I don't know how Lawrence created a sociopath who is hilarious at the same time (and who you actually feel sympathy for). This is a great book."
6551,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"http://www.rantingdragon.com/review-o... Our favorite debut of last year was unquestionably Mark Lawrence’s Prince of Thorns, a dark, brutally captivating tale of epic fantasy—or low; opinions on that were divided. This August will bring us King of Thorns, the second volume in The Broken Empire and sequel to Prince of Thorns. What he started in his debut, Lawrence expands in King of Thorns. Again, this is a breathtaking, captivating, and violent venture into a wonderful world filled with morally"
6552,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"Brilliant. I was twenty pages from the end when I had to stop to write this review before I forgot what I had to say. I have never done that before. King of Thorns is better than the first book. It is brutally brilliant, gruesomely good, and amid the carnage offers slivers of a rainbow before snatching it away in a world and future as grim and real as any out there. Amid the wickedness that is Jorg Ancrath, you will find wit and wisdom to match. Sometimes almost too much for a young man of eighteen"

6554,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"Still loving it! The writing stlye is a masterpiece. But dammit, I've got lost in the timeline again, so this flaw chalks up on the books board, not my inexpertness with the genre when I first read KoT. King of Thorns really needs your attention, otherwise you may get a bit lost in the timeline. The story whirls the reader between real time events and several flashbacks. It's a bit confusing but eventually a clear picture emerges as to what Jorg has blanked out from his mind, what was taken from"
6555,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,Jorg Ancrath has been haunting my dreams since book one. I love everything about the book and all the characters. I got to know them better and care for them. Oh how I love jorg❤❤❤
6556,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,3,"Executive Summary: I thought this was another decent entry to this series where I care more about the world building than the main character and his story. Audiobook: James Clamp does a good job. He reads with good volume and pace. He also does some voices, that adds a little extra that makes audio a great options for this book.

6557,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"You can see that I gave this book five stars. That's actually five trillion stars for King of Awesome, but GR is pretty stingy with its stars; it gave me a five-star limit. Anyway, I think I should let it out that the Broken Empire series is why I hate Mark Lawrence so much. Not only was I supposed to be studying for two tests when I read this second book, but I was also supposed to be studying for an exam when I read the first book, Prince of Thorns . I had fun reading the books, but my grades d"
6558,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"As always, this review and more can be found at Book Geeks Uncompromised . My rating for this book is more objective than probably most of my other ratings are. Despite my personal feelings on this book, I can’t deny that it is well done and likely enjoyable by a great many people that are not me. Here we are back with our Jorg Ancrath, the teenager that lives for blood and murder. Well not exactly, but it’s really not too far from the truth. Jorg is back along with his his small goal of ruling the"
6559,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"I was a little afraid about starting this series, as the reviews are very contradictory: some people loved the books, others totally hated them (or Jorg?). For me, it was a go-go from the very start, I got fascinated by the characters, the world and the hints at more than meets the eye. The whole series deals with politics, scheming, magic (mostly dark), ruthlessness, betrayals and lots of gory and cruel details about murders, battles and war. Even so, I snorted some many times, as there is also"

He takes what he wants at whatever the cost and subsequently the paths he takes end up littered with the dead, some of which haunt him from the shadows. He may be one evil necromantic young bastard but he shows (a little) growth and maturity in this second installment. His thoughts have grown to include a more sympathetic understanding of the plights of others, and despite his sociopathic"
6563,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,Truly brilliant. What an ending! Love the character development of Jorg so far. I should probably spend less time reading these books and more time revising for my imminent exams. Bring on the next one. RED JORG!
6565,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"And now, an exhaustive look at the dos and don'ts of kicking a severed head, as told by Jorg Ancrath: ""I dropped the head and kicked it into the crowd. I say 'kicked' but in truth it's a bad idea to kick a head. I learned that years ago, a lesson that cost me two broken toes. What you want to do is shove the head with the side of your foot, like you're throwing it. It's going to roll anyhow so you don't need that much force. See, the thing about severed heads is the owner no longer has any intere"
6566,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"This book blew me away and answered unanswered questions I didn't know I had from the first book, Prince of Thorns. The anti-hero, Jorg, has made himself a king -- of sorts. In book one of the series, Prince of Thorns, we meet Jorg and get introduced to his vengence against his evil uncle and father. Jorg's is a child bandit at 14 running a gang of killers and rapist. Why? Because he helped them escape his father's dungeon and he is brilliant so they let him lead. It's clear that Jorg is ruthless"
6567,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"I felt this was better than the first book in the series. Its more complex in a way and the characterization was better as well. There are characters who died that I didn’t want to die and even Prince Jorg becomes more likeable. The story starts off 4 years from when Jorg wrested the Renar Highlands from his uncle where he has set himself up as a King. Outside his walls, he is surrounded by twenty thousand soldiers led by the Prince of Arrow who intends to crush Jorg in a bid to become Emperor."
6568,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"5 Stars King of Thorns is one of those rare exceptions that have the sequel actually being better than the first. This book has a better plot, more character development, and an incredible ending. Jorg has taken the definition of an antihero dragged it through the mud and scum, bathed it in blood and filth, and caused us readers to wonder how far can he go and how far can we follow him. Lawrence has created a world that is simply incredible. As in the first book there are small snippets and morse"
6569,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,Mark Lawrence is carving a bloody path to the top of my Favorite Authors list. This book is a brilliant sequel to Prince of Thorns - read my review here King of Thorns
6570,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"Read it, it's damn good!"
6571,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,Really like this series. LOVE Jorg!!! Happy and Sad about some things that happened in this book. We must move forward though! The world awaits and it needs a smartass Emperor to run it.
6572,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"Wow! Better than Prince of Thorns, are you kidding?! It was such a treat for my opinion to do a 180° with this book. The main character was so changed since the first novel that I felt disappointed at first. I absolutely loved PoT's Jorg and I just wanted to see more of the brutal, ruthless, cunning little maniac. What a main character he was! But now we come to King of Thorns, where Jorg is (a little) older and more mature: calmer, introspective, strategic. Both Jorg's character and his story ar"

When I decided to put this book into my reading month I can honestly say that whilst I remembered enjoying the first (Prince of Thorns) I didn't remember quite so much about it. This book, however, was a step up from book 1 for sure and it's certainly one where I think some scenes will stay with me! In this book we follow Jorg once again and this time we are following two plotlines. The first plotline is the present day and this is set on Jorg's Wedding Day (which isn't the aver"
6574,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"I'm just going to say right off the bat that I enjoyed the first book a lot better than King of Thorns. However, in many respects, this book is much better than its predecessor. It's better written, a lot gorier but also strangely humorous just like the first book. Joe Abercrombie and Mark Lawrence must have a knack for mixing humor and violence. Incidentally, I recently read an interview of Mark Lawrence where he said that he'd never read any JA books. Well, that's interesting. Also I spotted q"
6575,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"Where book one was a mixing bowl of madness, crazy writing with randomness thrown in for good measure, book two is a journey into mind fucking. Whilst I am spare with profanity in my reviews and in life generally, I find when I do need decide to use them, it tends to give credence to the impact statement I am trying to make. This was a big bold move on Lawrence's part. This type of writing reminds me a little of The First Law series where the first of the trilogy is really just a character build"
6576,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"I've been thinking about this book a lot lately. Partially because I'm enrolled in the SPFBO hosted by the generous Grimdark God Mark Lawrence, and partially because I've been thinking about all the things this book got right, which I should replicate in my own writing. Interestingly enough, despite King of Thorns being my favorite Jorg book, it seems to be the least popular among fans of the series. I don't know why that is, but I know I loved it. 1. Jorg's relationships develop quite a bit in"
6577,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"I recently read a piece of writing advice about how to properly write violence and death by always making it count. Be it the character committing the act, the victim, or the observer, violence has to have a price. Gratuitous violence is just too easy. My thoughts went immediately to The Broken Empire series and it's antagonist, King Jorg Ancrath. Violence in his past shaped child into man by breaking him and letting the darkness we all harbour within ooze out. The article made me further appreci"
6578,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"There are very few constants in the world. Even the certainty of the speed of light is becoming debatable. I realized that as I got older. Growing up is the slow disrobing of ideals – at 5 not crapping your pants is an accomplishment worthy of a Nordic saga; at 15 a smile is not just an expression of happiness as you always thought before, it may be an invitation to carnal pleasures, and suddenly everything is an innuendo; at 25 your parents suddenly tumble from their pedestals and you realize t"

My new favourite Fantasy novel of 2012.” ~The Founding Fields You know in my review of The Blinding Knife, I mentioned that I’d found a favourite fantasy of novel of 2012? Well, as it happens, the very next fantasy novel that I read beats a Brent Weeks novel. Something that I’d never thought possible unless the name of that author was George RR Martin, Peter V. Brett"
6580,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"Well that was a hell of a ride. I read the second half of this book over the course of 2 days... which is quite rare for me given how slowly I read. That should tell you something about how much I enjoyed it. So King of Thorns follows on fairly directly from Prince... and also not. Jorg feels a bit more human this time around, slightly fewer sharp edges and not quite as much of an arsehole... though he is still very much an arsehole. The story is told across 3 different timelines. There's Jorg's we"
6581,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"Surely, in coming to this volume, you will have already read the first and your fascination with Jorg's character has overcome your distaste. Weeded out already are those who were not prepared to read about a protagonist they wouldn't want to be best buddies with and the generally squeamish. Those who read this volume should already know what they are letting themselves in for. If you couldn't abide the first book, you wont want to read this. In this volume, the character of Jorg continues to rip"
6582,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"I remember reading somewhere that, when writing a novel, you should never use flashback because it'll distract the reader and make the book an absolute load of wank. No shit, seriously? Apparently Mark Lawrence is flipping the bird to the literary critics and laughing his lungs out. A good 50% of ""King of Thorns"" is nothing but flashback. And guess what? It. Works. Ha! It really does. And in a marvellous way. The novel is sort of a patchwork made of short stories - I absolutely loved the circus"
6583,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"Synopsis : Four years have passed since Prince Honorous Jorg Ancrath took the throne of Renar from his uncle and now the time has come for the young king to wed his beautiful bride. A Wedding is often seen as an occasion to celebrate; for Jorg it may not be so, the Prince Of Arrow, a champion of the people stands outside the Haunt with an army of twenty-thousand soldiers, waiting for the king to surrender.

6584,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"Full Review originally at Fantasy Book Critic ANALYSIS: Last year Mark Lawrence debuted on the fantasy scene with his dark and morally tipsy book Prince of Thorns. It shocked many readers and led to interesting debates about the book, its main protagonist and the overall direction of the story. I thought that the writing and storyline was sheer brilliance. Mark Lawrence’s plot had the main protagonist who is a teenage sociopath and who in most novels would be featured as the series villain. The"
6585,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,2,Book 1: 4* Book 2: 2.5* I think I'm firmly in the minority in liking book one so much more but while that book was fueled by Jorg's grief and I loved that introspective this book lacked that. It never picked up steam for me and was a bit rambling.
6586,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"This was a slow burner for me but it delivered when all the strands came together. I struggled with the dual timelines at the start but as I got further into the book I started to look forward to switching so I could get another little piece of the puzzle. Possibly better than the first book for me, interesting setup for the third, keen to see how it all pans out 🗡⚔ well worth a read"
6587,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,That was just brilliant! The timeline bouncing between four years ago and now made for a really well developed story. Jorg is still his wonderfully terrible self. Can't wait to see what he does next!
6588,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"King of Thorns tops my list of most anticipated books in 2012. Now that I’ve read it, its ownership of the top spot is absolutely validated. I fully intended to ram my way through all 597 pages of the Harper Voyager hardcover but I couldn’t. It took me five days. There are books so good, so ‘unputdownable’ you breeze through them. King of Thorns is not that kind of book. Rather, it is a book so beautiful and sublime that I deliberately slowed my reading lest I miss a single meaningful word or nua"

Chess is black and white, which suits me rather well. A black king. But where’s the read? There should be red, a lot of it. A lot of red, a lot of blood. Because, I’ve played all my pawns for check mate. I’ve got one castle, one knight, a queen and a king on my side of the board. But, there’s six boards against my one side. Surely that’s against the rules? Why am I com"
6590,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"This sequel is better than its predecessor. Firstly, the structure was quite interesting – it comprised a present day narration (which covered all of a single day’s events), journal entries of Katherine Ap Scorron (read by Jorg) and flashbacks to 4 years ago after Jorg took the throne of Renar. I found that this worked well to thread together all the various plotlines (and Jorg’s well-laid plans) to culminate into the present day arc. There were, however, times when I was not sure what was happe"
6591,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"Like the first book, on the surface the story of King of Thorns is a simple one; in one timeline, a young man goes on an adventure to seek help from a wizard, and four years later in the present time, he is defending his kingdom from a rival prince. Sounds straightforward and rather typical, but the truth is that this book is as dark as its predecessor. If you're an avid reader of fantasy, the story elements and tropes will feel familiar...except more twisted and messed up. I was glad to see that"
6592,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"This is without any shadow of doubt-the best book of 2012.You have got to read this. It takes you on a whirlwind of emotions and feelings I have rarely felt for a main character and rolls it up into a heart thumping tale of blood,lust,revenge and outright audacity. I could not put it down. Mr Lawrence has done what I did not expect and made Jorg even better in this book than in Prince of Thorns. If you have read the first book and were unsure if it could get any better...then read this one- you wil"
6593,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"Loved this part much better, partly cause I understood how the storylines are put together. It was still very confusing, I wouldnt say annoying cause it was really captivating. I feel like I should reread it to understand it better. And I really dont mean this in a bad way. Looking forward to the final book! 'A man is made of memories. It is all we are. Captured moments, the smell of a place, scenes played out time and again on a small stage. We are memories, strung on storylines- the tales we te"
6594,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"How is it possible that I enjoyed such a horrible book? Its not horrible in the way it is written its that is so bloodthirsty, cruel, and downright evil. We learn a lot more of what Jorg has been through as a child and its not surprising he has turned out the way he is."

6596,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"Was it worth spending a month slugging through this book? >.- I am not really sure, but I liked Prince of Thorns and I wasn't about to turn a blind eye to King of Thorns (also, the title of King, sounds so much more badass than Prince, methinks ^_^). This has got to be the best 7 euro I have spent. May contain spoilers! Read at your own risk! This was in my opinion the strangest 5 star worthy book I have read. It builds up slowly, rarely displays any hint of action or anything aside from Jo"
6597,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"When I started this book, I thought to myself: How will this book hold its own against part one? I felt like the author must have already played all his cards, that's how amazed I was by the first book of this trilogy. But no. The second book started with a bang and it just kept on delivering. It was sometimes somewhat difficult for me to discern past happenings from the present (""does this character know this at this point?""), especially because the author plays around with the main character's"
6598,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"This was a very good read. There were a few things that I didn't like, but I got over it. There lots of blood & a lot of fighting. The end is satisfying. Everything is all set up for the final book in the series."
6599,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"Oh Jorg. Ok so I wasn't intending to write a review but I do have a few things I need to put down to remind myself of what this book was about. In short, this about Jorg getting married, Katherine getting married, the Prince of Orrin, a box of thorns, war, blood, smartness, sadness, happiness, conflictedness, actually those last three are just me. So Jorg has to get married to this 12 year old who btw I adore, I think she suits him to a T. Far better than Katherine ever would have. Jorg is still"
6600,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"I appreciate Jorg's development for the best in this installment. Here we get a glimpse at the human, the kid below all that mountain of wrong that Jorg has made of himself. His enemy is his complete contrary, a man whose strength comes from the better part of what the Broken Empire is full of. The pov's also worked really well, Mark does well for it never feels disrupting in the slightest."
6601,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"Although it took roughly 25% of the novel until we got to the meat of the action in this book I still really enjoyed the whole thing. Jorg is probably one of the most interesting characters I've ever been able to read from the point of view of. Although he was a bit tame at times, he certainly made up for it in the end. And what an ending!!!! Very intense. Bring on book three!!"
6602,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"I like myself a good sociopath. They make things interesting in a world of heroes and anti-heroes if well written. I found a new favorite in Jorg of Ancrath when I read Prince of Thorns and wrote this review . In the second book of The Broken Empire series, Jorg is now King of the Renar Highlands and he's all grown up. Now eighteen, he's preparing to marry his young bride Princess Miana with an army knocking at his door. The Prince of Arrow wants to roll right over him with numbers Jorg can't hope"
6603,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"I was less than impressed with the predecessor to this novel. It came across as forced, frustrating and playing to the modern fantasy crowd so in awe of G.R.R. Martin (though there are easily better classic fantasy series around which don't push the dark and grim idea). There was something about this novel however as a sequel that blew the first novel's failings out of the water and improved upon them immensely. Perhaps it was the expanded world. There were hints in the first novel that what Mark"
6604,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"As you can probably gather from the title, our dear Jorgy managed to achieve his goal of becoming a king. And now all his problems are solved and happiness is his! Oh, wait. No, not that. Actually, the armies of the combined nations of another claimant to the empire's throne, outnumbering his by a paltry 20 to 1, are marching on him to take his submission - or his head. And if we've learned anything about Jorg, it's that he'd rather die than submit - and he'd certainly rather kill. Of course, ha"
6605,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"Why Brother Jorg, You've gotten even more clever! King of Thorns, the second installment in The Broken Empire makes an excellent second book. The book, instead of picking the story from book one, jumps four years ahead, and we join Jorg on his wedding day. The book actually has three narrations. One on the wedding day, one of Jorg's recollection of events four years past and one presented in the form of Katherine's diary. As usual the narration is often complicated as it shifts back and forth bot"

I really took my time with this as I wanted to properly enjoy Mark's unique world building and beautiful writing. Jorg is ...Jorg. One of a kind psychopath who is now man grown. He is the main reason I even started reading this series in the first place and again.. he didn't fail me. Still an evil bastard through and through. But I think he might be on his way to redemption...or not. Either way he is bad-ass"

6608,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"This book was way better than the first one. I liked how the characters' personalities and thoughts are explored more. I finally got to see Jorg as something more than just a little bastard asshole, which definitely helped me enjoy the story more! I still get confused with the different times at which the story is set. I have to take real good notice of the chapter names and not stop reading halfway through a chapter. Other than that I really enjoyed this book more than Prince of Thorns so that'"
6609,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"A well written book with brilliant prose and a story that is at once fluid and well structured. King of Thorns assembles a great cast of characters: Princes, Earls, Fire-sworn sorcerers, völvas, necromancers and more...but it is Honorous Jorg Ancrath that made this a page turner for me. His growth, ambition, razor-sharp wit...his decision making in dealing with the various obstacles placed in his way all make for an enjoyable read. When you read Mark Lawrence you can expect a constant dosage of b"
6610,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"There's not much to say about the 2nd book in a series without spoiling the first one and usually the book in the middle just kind of hangs between the other two books and glues them together. Not this one though. King of Thorns definitely stands on its own two feet. It's a great story with a wonderful anti-hero that I love to hate, but secretly love. Mark Lawrence's writing is solid, the world building definitely very interesting and I'm looking forward to reading the conclusion."
6611,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,Better than the first one. By a hefty margin. http://staffersmusings.blogspot.com/2...
6612,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"King of Thorns is the second book in the The Broken Empire trilogy as we continue to follow the tale of Jorg. I really enjoyed this book, it was even better than the first one (and I really liked the first one too!). We follow two story plots in this book; Jorg in the present time as a six nation army marches toward Jorg's gates, led by a shining hero determined to unite the empire and heal its wounds and the past plot line which follows Jorg from end of book one and how he got to the present st"
6613,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"In heavily paraphrased words of Robin Hobb - this book was so amazing that I came late to work for past 3 days. And seriously considered taking day off. The chain of events (even though it goes back and forth in time like in Prince of Thorns) in this book is so captivating that even skipping to the last chapter and knowing the spoilers for whole ""thrillogy"" ;) couldn't keep me from reading it in the morning, missing breakfast, leaving in a hurry and arriving almost an hour late."
6614,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"Last year, when I read Prince of Thorns, I had one of those moments where I gained a new appreciation for the written word. It set a new standard for every other fantasy novel I read--and I read only fantasy novels. I didn't know how I was going to get by until August 7, 2012, the most anticipated day of the year. (Wait, 2nd most. My wedding day is first, right? Right?) Then August 7th arrived! Oh happy day! I immediately threw aside my other responsibilities, namely health and personal hygiene,"

Where I should start? I had such high expectations for this book, and"
6617,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"After reading the Prince of thorns, the King of Thorns instantly became my most eagerly anticipated book of everything I have read or want to read. Amidst the darkness that is Jorg Ancrath, you will find also find wit and wisdom in abundance far outstripping a young man of eighteen years but then he is not a normal young man. Jorg Ancrath despite the brutality has a confidence, charm and swagger that endear you to the character, quite simply he is one of the best characters in fantasy fiction. Told"

I can still criticize my lack of sensibility to them, when I question whether I should read each and every a good book. Then there are books like this, that draw you in before you have time to think of standards. And never let go. This book, unlike the first, takes a decidedly darker and more mature tone than the other. The first is unique for Jorg's voice and the origi"
6619,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"Excellent. I wish it had been longer though, mainly because the story took a while to get going and then it did and then it rushed through a series of events and then boom! Finished. I would want more spent on how Jorg learnt about Fexler Brews and his manner of death and more importantly all the adventures he had while he was touring the Empire. But this is a call for *more*. Lawrence has delivered yet another deeply dark and intense tale that when I describe it to my friends I say it's 'Game o"
6620,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"OK, so I wanted to wait and write my review after I finished the whole trilogy instead of reviewing each book individually. All I can say, is Wow! From character and world development, to gripping plot, to Mark's unique style of storytelling. I thoroughly enjoyed the ride from beginning to end. Of course like most I was left wanting more... a lot more, but I have to agree with Mark's afterthought. Pushing a good thing too far can ruin it. I was left disappointed in a good way. I highly recommend"
6621,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"The second installment did not disappoint, picking up from the first one and expanding in just about every area. The plot is more complex, there is a lot more content, and we get to see some real depth in Jorg's character. Although I felt it slowed a bit in the middle, the book certainly picks up for its conclusion. This is not a series for everyone - Lawrence's blunt writing and strong emphasis on 'show, not tell,' is something not every reader will be able to stick - but for those who are look"

It gelled why I'd been feeling differently about this book and then about-faced and we were back on the level and all was well. And now I love this one even more than the first.

6624,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"This trilogy is like wine, the older it gets the better (although I absolutely loved the first one. I just thought it couldn’t get any better and it DID, in so many levels). I adore that we get to see and know a little bit more of Katherine. And Jorg, oh Jorg I LOVE YOU forever, one of the most interesting and amazing character to read and know more about it. Can't wait to read the sequel, but I don't wanna to end. Mark Lawrence did it again, another book that I just couldn't stop reading."
6625,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"There is the occasional book that comes along and makes you consider changing all your other five star reviews to four stars. These books are rare, because each time one comes along it sets the bar that much higher for the next book. Can you believe it? I've read two of them this year, back to back, and they're both by Mark Lawrence. Just read this series. Pick up your Kindle or your Nook, or do like I did and order the hardbacks for the top shelf, because this is top shelf material."
6626,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"Okay so that was actually 10 stars. Favorite Quote: “The next words out of your mouth, priest, will be ‘Yes, Your Highness’ or you’ll be making a meal of this cane.” To his credit the priest hesitated, then said, “Yes, Your Highness.” I doubt he believed my lineage, but he sure as hell believed my culinary predictions."

6630,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"Ah, that difficult middle book of the trilogy! The one that carries all the baggage of the first without the freshness, while also setting up the climax of the third without being able to resolve the big questions. All too often it feels like drifting - there’s motion of a sort, but it’s slow or undirected. There’s an element of that here. What seems like the main plot, the massive army of the Prince of Arrows camped at Jorg’s gate, seems to play second fiddle to the flashback story which feels"

Whose definition of competent is another story :) Let me just start by saying I am very guilty of finishing a book with ""OMG...that was the best thing I've ever read"" (see initial review of this book below). I'm very, very easily excitable. Those thoughts and feelings usually wear off with time or with the next ""best thing I've ever read."" That being said, this past"

I'm not sure whether there have been any character less worth to have his HEA, but I SO want Jorg to have it! And the writing! It's so... lyrical (I know, huh?

However, about 3/4 way into the book all of those points finally come together and started to made sense, cultimating to an epic finale where Jorg conquers all once again.

6635,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"This book has to be one of the most ambitious narratives I've ever read. It's plotted between the present (of the time of the book, of course) and four years prior. It moves seamlessly through these two times, weaving together a very complex tale and it does it successfully, as the past and the present blend without snare to present a very broad image. The first book was something of an acquired taste. Jorg Ancrath was an arrow fired from a blindman's bow, hellbent on destruction, pain, and panic"

6637,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"An absolutely worthy sequel of Prince of Thorns. I simply couldn't put the book down. It's a deeper and more complex book. While the first is mostly linear, this one is a roller coaster, full of surprises and aha moments. It was really interesting to see Jorg's personality developing even more. His monologues were written impressively. It feels like many thoughts the author had himself and managed to give them to Jorg, be it about the essence of men or mountain-climbing. I'm glad Jorg isn't the edg"
6638,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"I'll start off by saying that, although I liked this book, it wasn't as enjoyable as Prince of Thorns. That in no way means that it isn't good, it's just that I found the four years earlier concept a little harder to follow in King of Thorns, leaving me feeling somewhat confused on occasions. And, as I wrote in a couple of my pre-review notes, GR have wrongly estimated the number of pages as 449, my copy has 597 pages.

6640,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"Very different from anything i have read, in a good way. Great read, very intelligently written and fantastic prose!"
6641,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"The second book in this unique Fantasy/ Scifi blend. Firstly a must in my opinion is that you read book one, King of Thorns just doesn't work without having experienced Prince of Thorns. The main Character Jorg, so basic, so simple and yet so complex and so diverse its an amazing feat to have achieved on paper, for me something this complex comes with a fair bit of yawning and desire to skip a few pages. But not with this book (or Prince) the clear writing and story direction just enthrals the re"
6642,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"Another very good book and worthy sequel from Mark Lawrence. As always, in my review I won't describe any summary of the plot or something like it, it's up there and you can read it. I'll just word my thoughts which are mostly possitive. I think what Lawrence does with this book is take everything from the first book and turn it up a notch. That includes everything that is good but also some things that are not so good. Negatives first and I'd say that for me there are 2 of them. One is that even"
6643,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"King of Thorns isn’t just better than Prince of Thorns, it improves on it. Let me explain what that means. The first book was all about setting up Jorg’s character. I’ve discussed it at length so I won’t do so again, but every reader has a clear picture (though not necessarily the same picture) of who we’re reading about. King of Thorns takes this and plays with it, exploring it to a depth not fully realized in the first volume. You thought Jorg was a complex character? Just wait until you’ve rea"
6644,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,Brilliant A great follow up! It kept me turning page after page. I can't wait to finish off with Emperor now.
6645,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"When I read first read The Prince of Thorns I came away from it feeling as it that book had subtly changed my life. It was an experience I think, not dissimilar to the one Jorg described in The King of Thorns. Having climbed to the top of that mountain and seeing the world from such a different perspective everything afterward was just a little bit changed from what it had been before because he had changed too. That is what the Prince of Thorns did for me, I had thought it to be one of the best"
6647,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"The worst part about this book...the third one doesn't come out until August 2013! Admittedly, the second begins a little slower. Jorg doesn't seem his evil fun self, at least not as much as the first book. Take heart gentle reader, everything has its time and purpose! Mr. Lawrence deftly uses the two storylines (present day is four years after the first book ends, while the flashbacks represent events which happened shortly after the first ends) to paint an unfolding tapestry which keep the ten"
6648,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"There is no way I could write a good enough review that would do this book justice, it's so clever and I absolutely loved it! The character development on all the characters from the first book is brilliant, I think Gog definitely became one of my favourites. It was interesting that this book was written so we read from both the past and the present, it was exciting to find out what happened in the past slowly and made this book so hard to put down. The plot was so interesting, I was completely una"
6649,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"If you can read prince of thorns and not want to read King of Thorns, I would get checked out. Similarly, if you can read King of Thorns and not sit waiting like the rest of us for Emperor of Thorns to be released, I would suggest couseling. Seriously though, this story only adds to what was an incredible start in prince of thorns. The action does not die down and the story only gets thicker. Weddings and deaths, blood and the unmatched wit of Jorg will carry you to the last page where you will p"

6655,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"This book is so damn amazing! My questions from the previous book were answered in King of Thorns but it arises new questions that I feel a great need for answers RIGHT NOW! I love how this book had me second guessing not just to how Jorg will win his battles but also how he sits in the plan of the Players in conquering and uniting the Broken Empire. I love how Jorg resists the manipulation of the players, how he remains to be vicious but a bit more mature, still evil and flawed but with a littl"
6656,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"The first book, Prince of Thorns, was a packed potential legend but with a lead who failed miserably in my eyes. It still held a compulsive allure to it, a sense of a deeper story lying hidden beneath the shallow waters, enough to make me eager to plow on with the next book. King of Thorns was nothing like its predecessor and everything which I wanted it to be. -Jorg Ancrath- A lead can make a story or break it. And this one not only makes it, he welds together all the ends in a knot so tight and"
6659,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,3,Still a really enjoyable series however I did not like this one more then the first book. This reason is mainly because of how the story was told. There is a time jump of four years and that is where the story starts but then we also flashback to find out what happened after the events in the first book. I found the flashback arc of this book to be more invested then the present. I did love the ending to this book however and I am really intrigued to see where this book goes. I know it is going

6663,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"I really really really liked it. There was no second book syndrome and a tone of stuff happened. I've come to really enjoy the authors strategy of using two POV's for Jorg in each book. They always separate between the present and 4 years earlier and while during the first half they seem to have no connection, they slowly start to come together and its like reading two series together. Miana is awesome and I wish she were the one instead but I like that there is an immediate understanding and u"
6664,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"Underneath the dark, gritty prose is a truly epic masterpiece that is so exceptional as to outshine other writers within this genre!! The eagerly anticipated sequel to ‘Prince of Thorns’ exceeds all expectations, with Mark Lawrence’s writing just getting better and better as his inspired creation contains even more depth. Similar to Joe Abercrombie this bloodcurdling, graphic narrative is coated in blood, gore and is so atmospheric that you can actually smell the putrid stench of death, see the"

I am not him because we die a little every day and by degrees we are reborn into different men, older men in the same clothes with the same scars. “ A changed man ? That’s what I thought when I read this musing by Jorg Ancrath. It was followed by a moment of inward groaning and a mutter from my mind that ’Oh there goes another fine character to become a goody two-shoes.' But then, good old Jorgy was never one to stick to clichés and he proved me wrong by resorting to what he d"

The king of the lightning is the second volume of the fantasy trilogy The Broken Empire by Mark Lawrence, published in the British market in 2012 and arrived in Italy in 2013 thanks to Newton Compton.

6667,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"The final chapter of this novel is so satisfying that chills still ripple down my spine whenever I think of it. This is the book that firmly cemented Jorg Ancranth not only as one of my favourite characters in fantasy, but as the perfect example of how someone so evil can be so lovable."
6668,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"My, my, this book what a ride. I liked Prince of Thorns a lot, but this one is in a completely different league. I can easily say now that the Broken Empire is my favorite fantasy series next to Mistborn . Let’s start, shall we? The writing is just as powerful as the first book, if not more so. I remember the witty dialog and the subtle development. Every paragraph flows into the next. We explore the world building through the eyes of the narrator and there is no info dumping (Thank you, Mark Lawre"

A dark time comes. My time. If it offends you. Stop me. I LOVE this book. I hadn't read a book where it's main character is so dark, harsh, uncompromising and utterly unapologetic for it in a long time. He revels in it. He makes no excuses for his actions. Even with all that he does you just can't help but like the guy anyway. He has his own de"
6670,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"I really enjoyed the first book but I love the second book in the Broken Empire series. The book is structured similarly to the first book with the narrative taking place directly after the conquest of Renar and then 4 years later. In the present day, Jorg is marrying a young girl named Miana and facing an attack on the castle by the overwhelming forces of the Prince of Arrow. Throughout the book Jorg is harassed by Chella and Sageous, who we met in book 1. There are ominous warnings about the D"

I think he should linger. I am in love with this series! Mark Lawrence is a new favorite, for sure. This is a violent story told in a grim future, but with Lawrence at the helm there is a haunting elegance about it which makes my senses tingle in all of the best ways! Prince of Thorns was good, but King of Thorns is fucking spectacular! It is an even"
6672,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"This book works for me mostly because Jorg is such a unique sort of protagonist that he gets me hooked and truly interested in knowing what made him walk the path he's walking (because socipaths are not born in a day, you know?) and here I found a more grown up Jorg, not necessarily more human but more mature and aware of the fact his actions have repercusions and come with a burden he has to bear.I enjoyed watching Jorg evolve and seeing the people gathered around him go from felons to loyal fo"
6673,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"Mark Lawrence has built a world upon much of the same idea as St. Zelazny's "" This Immortal "". The earth has been ruined by nuclear war, and the world has plunged back into a middle age. We ‘The Builders’, as what remains of human society call us, did in our last days nudge the universal constants and so blurred the lines between life and death, science and magic, reason and unreason. On the continent small-time war lords, none of them having more technology then the forge, are in constant conflict"
6674,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"I just finished King of Thorns today. To quote my own tweet posted minutes after, ""WOW! Most powerful book I've read since... well, shit! I don't know."" If the rating scale would allow, I'd enthusiastically give it a 10/10 or a 100/100 for that matter. Nothing in this book gave me any kind of pause - from thinking some character was acting too unrealistic, even for fantasy, to feeling the events simply couldn't have unfolded the way they did - everything in King just made logical sense.

6675,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,*sigh* I literally just finished this book 10 mins before writing this review (the bathroom accounts for a couple of those as I refused to take a break for any reason until I've read every last word). How can I begin? We all know Jorg is a bastard of the highest order (I think he killed someone in book one for calling him that?) and I instantly hated him for his callous ways and lack of respect for human life. Yet something much deeper and more complicated than love or hate developed for those v
6676,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"Father was right of course. There were lessons to be learned that night. The dog was a weakness and the Hundred War cannot be won by a man with such weaknesses. Nor can it be won by a man who yields to the lesser evil. Give an inch, give any single man any single inch and the next thing you hear will be, ""One more, Jorg, one more."" And in the end what you love will burn. Father's lesson was a true one but knowing that can't make me forgive the means by which he taught it. Someone burns a dog al"
6677,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"I was afraid that King of Thorns would fall to the “second book” curse but I am so glad that I was wrong because this book was simply amazing! However, I must warn you: this series is not for everyone. It contains content that may be uncomfortable for some people. The first thing I would like to address is the world-building. In the first book, I was confused with where and when this book took place but my questions were finally answered in this book. I don’t want to spoil anything but I must sa"
6678,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"Brother Mark. Many thanks for writing the book – which technically I have never actually read. As you know. As a non-reader of your book please allow me a letter of complaint. In the many written commentary of yours I did not come across one single warning about the consequences of opening a door to the Broken Empire. The tube stops I would miss as temporarily lost in some awful dead-end marshland somewhere far far away, the sleepless nights spent witnessing violent deeds of blood and fire, subs"
6679,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"King of Thorns is the best book of the trilogy. One of the best I have ever read. Each page is a different surprise. A big different surprise. Mark Lawrence gave his best in this book and Jorg too. The creator and the creation have a visible progress in this work. Both of them seem magical. While stealing our attention, they run a preposterous plan in our blind spot. The fusion of plots is the grand finale that every magician would like for their show. So prepare your mind before you read it, becau"
6680,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"I'm still fascinated by the fact that I'm rooting for Jorg no matter what the situation is. He is greedy, selfish, sadistic, and foolhardy, yet I enjoy every bit of it. I love his sarcasm and the humor that goes along with it. Jorg is what makes the story so interesting. His character is like none that I have read before. Never have I cared so much for the overly prideful. Lawrence has done a wonderful job molding this character into someone we all can relate to at some point and keeping us inte"
6681,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"This trilogy keeps getting better the further I wade into it. Jorg Ancrath is still playing the game of empire, using his own rules and placing the right pieces in place. This guy has an amazing handle on playing the long game. As he deftly maneuvers himself closer to the empire throne in King of Thorns , it is clear to readers of Prince of Thorns that Jorg is growing up and maturing. That is not to say he's unwilling to make difficult gory choices. He is willing, but doesn't revel in the gore as"
6682,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,2,"EDIT: I have read Book 3 and gave it 5 stars. So there. I was very excited to get back to this series. So much that even Stephen King had a hard time keeping me focused with Dr. Sleep: Prince of Thorns was still resonating in my mind. That book held everything I appreciate in fantasy: A great story, mysteries about the world, and cool revelations. A lot of reviewers mention the same thing about this book in comparing it to its predecessor: it was as if the author 'grew up' with more polished writin"
6683,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,2,"I really really really liked book 1 so obviously I was excited to pick up book 2. But sadly that has ended in a bit of a disappointment... The only reason why I'm giving this book 2 stars instead of the 1 that I was planning to give it was because the last couple of chapters were okayish, they were interesting. In this book you follow 3 different plot lines: 1: Jorg not that long after book 1 ended (called 4 Years Earlier) 2: Jorg when he's 18 (called Wedding Day) 3: Katherine through her diaries. Now"
6684,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"Previous to this I read ‘Legend’ by David Gemmel, and also recently Sanderson’s ‘Way Of Kings’, and it was hilarious watching the traditional conventions of heroic/high fantasy being wreaked havoc upon here by Jorg and his brothers. But that was just the tip of the ice-burg. Both plot and character development in King Of Thorns were outstanding. Genius. Each scene profoundly vivid and beautifully written, the style and grace of a masterpiece, start to finish. And this book contains the most exci"
6685,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,3,"I can't even cope with this series. It's silly and gross one moment and then powerful and moving the next. It's hard to get a handle on Jorg as a character, partially because he has elements of a gritty wish-fulfillment antihero but also is textually shown to be a bad person who has committed inexcusable atrocities. He's a sympathetic character, but also vile, but also delightfully awful and I can't help but want him to win but I also can't help but want him to be a better person, even though I"
6686,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"Without sounding overly enthusiastic, this series is shaping up to be the best fantasy series I have ever read. The story alone is brilliant enough, but it is Mark’s style of writing that really brings it to life. As brutal as he can be, I really enjoy being inside Jorg’s head, and the thing I like most about King of Thorns is that we’re inside it a whole lot more than we were in Prince of Thorns. I really liked the way he would talk to the reader, and give us his personal views/theories on the"
6688,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,3,I really enjoyed the first book in this series but I struggled through the first half of this second volume. I found myself skimming sections that just didn't interest me very much. I usually end up dropping the book after I start that but I hung on because of my enjoyment of the previous book and in the end it did turn around. I thought the writing in the first book was lean and crisp but there felt like quite a bit of filler through the beginning of book two. I don't have a problem with a narr
6689,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,3,"This really wasn't that amazing. There was no plot (only endless traveling), all the characters were bland and absolutely indistinguishable from each other, and it was mostly just BORING AS FUCK. Still, I give it 3 stars, because it had some tiny parts I liked and the world building is good (though it didn't really show in this one). Also, am I the only one who is really annoyed at how there's always this brilliant, magical object that the characters just happen to have and that always saves them"
6690,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"I had to grind this one out, because for me 'Wedding Day' was far more interesting than 'Four years ago' and there seemed to be far more of the less preferred story line to read! The ending made it all worthwhile though, and the hard slog paid off. I basically moved straight onto this from the first, although I will have a break before beginning book three. I feel like my brain needs a bit of a refresh, so I'm reading something completely different now. I did adore the big battle scenes, especial"
6691,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"Five stars for sure. Mark only went and made this better than the first, somehow. Had me laughing out loud more and feeling for characters more. Jorg has grown as a character and I really liked reading that. Full of surprises and I cannot wait to pick up the next."
6692,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"I read first part many, many years ago and then didn't know where to find the sequels. And I'm glad I did. King of Thorns is just SO good. Dark and Jorg is very unique character. And something about this makes me think of Assassin's Creed... 4,5/5"
6693,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"I very rarely leave reviews as prefer to read my words than write them, but this book is amazing. Honest, gritty, dark and totally engrossing. Every character fully written, as good as the first book... maybe better. Either way both books are amazing, can't recommend enough :)"
6694,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,Brutal. Intelligent. Bloody. Charismatic. Violent. Suspenseful. Intriguing. Humorous. Dark. Sexy. What more could you want? Believe the controversy. Indulge in the hype. I f**king love Jorg. 5 out of 5 stars.

The stakes are high and the plot twists are indescribable.

6699,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"I immensely enjoyed this book, and now that I'm finished with it I wish I had the third book to read right now. The first book was an amazing start, but I found this book to be so much better. It's really masterfully constructed, and incredibly well written.

In this book however, I found it to be much more successful, an"

6704,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"Honorous Jorg Ancrath was introduced in the book Prince of Thorns . It was very hard to like him. He associated with the worst possible crowd, his methods were beyond questionable, the word ‘fair’ does not exist in his dictionary, committing atrocities around the Hundred Kingdoms was the least of his flaws. But Jorg Ancrath is a very complicated character. His past is scarred with thorns that has chosen the path he walks. Intelligent, charming and ruthless are just a glimpse of his qualities. For"
6705,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"One of my favourite books of 2011 was Mark Lawrence's debut novel Prince of Thorns . While hotly debated and often maligned for it supposed misogyny, I found Lawrence's story of this black-hearted prince and the forces that made him who he was and which manipulate his actions still fascinating. Not only did Lawrence tell a fantastic story, he also told it in wonderful prose. Unsurprisingly, I was looking forward to reading King of Thorns , which however I didn't get to read until this past week."
6706,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"I love Mark Lawrence's writing. Dark characters with equally dark philosophy. The story unfolds almost like a stream of consciousness including lots of flashbacks if that is possible. It is a fatalistic type of story telling, all of the characters seem sharply aware of who they are and what end is likely to await them. Life just is, there isn't any noble motives or care for others because in the end none of it matters. Jorg is bad, he uses his friends and allies almost without thought. He mostly"

I've read a lot of reviews of this book that almost unanimously claim that King of Thorns is much better than it's predecessor.

Obviously the plot and characters thicken quite nicely in KoT and really, I couldn't ask for a better sequel - but there are two reasons that I enjoyed PoT just that li"

6711,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,"Actual review: 4.5 I am in awe. Literally, my jaw dropped and I stared at this book, because it was amazing! The only thing that has stopped me from giving it a perfect score is the fact that the first half of the book moved too slow for my liking. The latter half of this book, however… WOW .

I could say that Honorous Jorg Ancrath is an anti-hero, it would be true though inaccurate. I could write that Mark Lawrence once more trumped the stereotypes of fantasy I'm used to, it would still be inaccurate but true. I could even say that King of Thorns is just a sequel to Prince of Thorns and it would be truly inaccurate. King of Thorns in many"
6715,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"Reviewing the second entry in a series is tricky business. With a book that blew me away like Prince of Thorns, there is a tendency to expect a similar experience from its sequel, which is sort of unfair if you think about it. This is especially so in the case of PoT, because part of the joy of it was how incredibly surprising it was. Almost regardless of what you know going in, Lawrence shatters your expectations immediately, uses one of the shards to stab you in the gut, then twists and digs i"
6716,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,"There's a lot going on with King of Thorns that begs me to go back and read it again soon. Firstly, hats off to Mark Lawrence for juggling a non-linear story structure. We follow Jorg on his wedding day when he goes toe to toe with the golden boy, the prince of Arrow, who's set to become the emperor. Or at least that's what everyone keeps saying. We simultaneously also follow the events that happened to Jorg four years ago, as he settles in his position of king of Renar. The Jorg we follow in boo"

In the process he won himself a Kingdom (albeit small). In King of Thorns the story continues. This time Jorg is fighting against all odds (and against the natural human instinct to survive, compromise and in general get along) to retain that Kingdom.

That said, he's mellowed in this book into someone recognizably human.

Everything you read about Mark Lawrence's ""Broken Empire"" is that it's dark; that it's deep, deep hole of base emotions and actions. I can see why people say that and while I see it in the book(s), I also see an explanation of the why and how of it's plausibility.

With that in mind; in addition to The Dark Tower saga, this novel is one of Mr.King's lesser known creations that is definitely more Tolkien than Tommyknockers. It is an easy story to get into and I was intrigued from the first page. My grandfather gave me this book when I was a wide-eyed, eleven-year-old lover of Goosebumps b"

6731,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,2,"At its time of publication, way back in 1984, The Eyes of the Dragon was a bit of a departure from Stephen King’s typical horror fare. I wouldn’t say it was his first venture into the fantasy genre, per se, considering the iconic Gunslinger (the first of the Dark Tower books) was released a few years prior to this one, but I do believe it was his first attempt at a novel length fairy tale. It makes perfect sense that King would dedicate this story to his daughter, considering the cutesy feel to i"

I don't enjoy reading about people being tormented and murdered. I like to read about people overcoming their fears and the villains they encounter in life. So it was nice to read a story by King in a setting I love, fairy tale land. This is a fairy tale, with all the usual trappings, and he does a great job with it.

I do not always enjoy adult fairy stories, but this one catches you up into the action and there is nowhere to go except to read and enjoy the whole book. The way the story is told is quite original.

6747,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,"Probably King’s most atypical novel. A fairytale-style story about two brothers disputing over the throne in a vague Kingdom where the power is manipulated byt the evil wizard Flagg. Not much reminds us that we are reading a book by Stephen King here. There’s Flagg, who is the most memorable part of this book, and then there are of course those boogers… It is told by a narrator from our time which at times feels a bit askew. The story has some nuance and atmosphere. Some parts hold together well"
6749,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,"I really missed out reading this book when I was 14. King packed this baby with all of the tropes YA fiction should contain and made a fun, page turning novel - even if we know how everything is going to turn out. The snarky narrator is an extra bonus. And how cool is it that he wrote this book for his daughter? He even gave a character in the book her name. Did he win Father of the Year when this was first published?"

I couldn't quite give it five stars this time around, since it's not as epic or grand as something like The Talisman , but my sheer enjoyment of the story has not diminished with the years.

This is also the first YA book he wrote that he wrote for his daughter.

6781,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,2,"2 1/2 There is something that some authors who usually write for adults do, sometimes, when they are writing for a younger audience - and that is that they clearly write for a younger audience. This book had some of that sing-songy tone to it that adults sometimes use with children when they're sort of talking down to them. That whole ""Now pay attention, boys and girls, while we see the big, bad magician trick the silly people."" It's... annoying. And it makes me want to almost mark this book as j"

6783,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,"At times, King's approach to writing from a storyteller's perspective is a little cloying, and there's a lot of old-fashioned narrator presence in this one. ""I'm sorry to say,"" ""It's not for me to tell,"" ""You'll have to make up your mind""; to me, this stuff is cute in very small doses but betrays a little too much the mechanics behind writing itself. It's difficult to get really lost in a story when the author continually reminds you that it's a story. Other than that, this is a good adventure y"

For one thing, it’s squarely in the young adult genre (aside from an early reference to “The King’s Iron,” a.k.a. the royal penis). The book is also relatively short, clocking in at a modest (for King) 384 pages. Both traits impressed me; changing your writing style is no easy thing.

A risky move by King, as well as removing his reputation as a horror author by creating a purely fantastical novel. I think it can be"
6802,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,"The Eyes of the Dragon is a Stephen King that slipped past my notice in the 80's, probably because it was fantasy. And I was in a snooty collegiate phase at the time, thinking Pynchon God because... well... he was often near impossible to follow... Heck, I'd even disavowed King's early works which I'd love in high school, like The Stand and The Shining , as schlock. Typical. Snotty late adolescent. Though I did read and loved It one summer break, a ""guilty"" pleasure. Lucky for me, I got older. No"
6804,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,"Having read The Stand last summer, I was surprised to encounter a familiar villain in The Eyes of the Dragon : Randall Flagg. In this story, he appears as an evil magician bent on inciting destruction and violence in the kingdom of Delain. We begin with the stories of King Roland and Queen Sasha, building up to the births of their two sons, Peter the noble heir to the throne and Thomas the cowardly and underappreciated younger brother. When Flagg plots an assassination against the king, the two b"
6805,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,"This book was okay! I DNFed it at 73%. This was my first Stephen King novel. I've read a couple of his short stories previously, but none of his longer works. I really tried to read this, but I would think that I should try to read a little bit of this and feel an aversion. And I'm not going to force myself through a book I'm not liking. I did enjoy parts of it, but Dennis is simply very boring to me. I also hated the gender roles enforced in this book and only let them slide as this was written"

""The road to hell is paved with good intentions, but he also knew that for human beings, good intentions are sometimes all there are. Angels may be safe from damnation, but human beings are less fortunate things, and for them hell is always close."" Stephen King and fantasy? Surely you jest! I know at"
6807,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,"This is my second read of this book (I read it the first time about 15 years ago). The Kingdom of Delain is ruled peacefully by King Roland and his two sons, Peter and Thomas. But when King Roland suddenly dies of a strange and evil poison, his son Peter is blamed for the murder and sentenced to live the rest of his life in a tall tower called the Needle. King Roland's assistant Flagg is an evil magician who wants to topple the entire kingdom. As Thomas deals with his own guilt surrounding Rolan"
6808,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,"This is my third Stephen King, but I’ve been told it’s not typical. I don’t think my others ( 11/22/63 and Joyland ) were typical either! I started this with some apprehension, as fantasy is not usually my genre (and I had chosen to read this because I needed a book with a dragon for a particular challenge!!) but I was pleasantly surprised. It’s written in the style of a fairytale, although at 400+ pages, it’s a little longer than your average fairytale! I got caught up in the story, found the charac"
6809,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,"Not only have I read this book 3 times, I own it because it is one of my favorites. Stephen King is the kind of guy who can write about anything. The sorcerer in this story is none other than Randall Flagg since this is medieval fantasy, it shows that the Dark man is eternal. My copy of this book is very old, and has beautiful drawings of the dragon. There is a peep hole through the Dragon's eye, used for spying on members of the royal family. Eavesdropping is not a new concept. Randall Flagg is a"
6810,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,"While not the most original plot or intricately woven world, Stephen King has a way of telling a story that makes it hard to put down anything he writes, including his mostly successful attempt at the fantasy genre, The Eyes of the Dragon . One thing I am very curious about is whether J.K. Rowling read this, which was first published in 1984, right before she wrote the Harry Potter series. I say this because of the stinging number of similarities I found in the two works: a teenage boy protagonist"
6811,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,"I was waiting for a dragon! Well, without spoiling it…you’ll see for yourself if there are dragons or not, but if you love fairy tales and all things kings and evil magicians, and king court politics and intrigue and napkins (yes, napkins), then dive in. I haven’t even noticed how I swallowed this book. King has this effect on readers, doesn’t he. A few hours later you look up and wonder, “Where am I?”"
6814,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,"Another book I really need to re-read so I can fully appreciate the Dark Tower connection! I loved this story because it was different, and my first dabble into King's fantasy. I honestly don't remember much of the actual story now but I do remember enjoying it immensely, and how it kept me captivated from start to finish. Personally, I think it's one of King's more underrated novels."
6816,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,"This is definitely one of Stephen King's better novels. I listened to it in audio, and the narrator did a fabulous job of bringing this fairytale to life. What can I say, the child in me loved it. :)"
6817,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,Very different for a Stephen King book but I loved everything about it. Especially the end where thing's aren't completely resolved so it leaves it open for another story maybe? If you like Stephen King this is a must read to show just how versatile a writer he really is.
6818,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,"Radically different than any other Stephen King work, ""Eyes of the Dragon"" is a fantasy book set in a medieval world in a fictional kingdom. It starts slow, but the pace changes as it progresses, subtly transforming from a children's book into what could be considered a young adult one. Judging by the phrasing and the ""educational"" vibe it emits, it's clearly targeted at children. Nevertheless, some of the character names are those of already established famous Stephen King characters, such as Rol"
6819,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,I read this for two reasons: 1) It's the only time Stephen King has written out and out straight up high fantasy. 2) It's got Randall Flagg. Overall this was lovely if not super arch. It's got kings and princes and a court magician and a dragon and tall towers and castles such that it makes me evaluate how much we actually need stories that are so down the middle tropey with regards to fantasy. Where it succeeded was in the telling of it. King is a hell of a storyteller and can weave a hell of a
6820,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,"All of King's style is here, but kid friendly. It was amazing, simply put. I loved all the references that I caught. I read this only to make sure it was suitable for a 13 year old, and I'm happy I finally picked up this masterpiece. I think it'll be a great start for a younger generation's relationship with King, and for the Constant Reader, it sure ticked off a lot of reasons as to why I love King to begin with."
6822,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,"An amazingly written fantasy story. 👌 I loved the friendship and the loyalty between Peter, Ben AND Dennis. . . A pretty enjoyable read. 🌌👍🐉👑"
6824,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,I read that this book was one of the inspirations for King to write Misery as a lot of fans were mad at him for writing something that wasn’t horror. I think this story is proof that King can write so much more than horror and it still be a damn good story. I think that quote about friendship is going to stick with me for awhile. I’m still kicking myself my having not read this earlier in life. I think I would’ve loved the hell out of this story in high school and I may have become a Constant Re
6826,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,1,"I haven't, in the rereading of King's work, read his collaboration with Peter Straub as yet. I'm saving The Talisman and Black House , along with the Dark Tower series until the end. I consider The Talisman to be his first misstep, the first time I read something by him and was disappointed, but I'd put it down to the perenially disappointing Peter Straub (yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, I know, he's good blah blah blah. I do not like his stuff. Get over it.) But with this book, King officially produced"
6827,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,"This was quite a captivating read, though I have mixed feelings about it (hence the 3 stars). I liked the story, but it was not very complex, and from the start, we know the general outline of what will happen. The narrator, who makes his presence known with various comments, tells us from the start what the main event of the book is (though at the time, I didn't know that the book wasn't going to go much further than this). I liked this on the whole, and found the narration fun and ""cozy"" to li"

6831,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,"I don't think I have ever come away from a Stephen King book and thought ""delightful!"". Yet that was the case here. This book had passed me by and I picked it up recently since it was on sale and sounded interesting enough. This novel is more straight-forward fantasy, but with a quest or a long-winded adventure. Instead there is a focused narrow story arc involving the King and his two sons. Betrayal and then seeking for justice. Yet not a self-serving justice tainted with revenge, but a thirst fo"
6832,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,"More of a 3.5. This is my first Stephen King book. I've bought a lot of his books before (thick ones, with small font sizes!) but I've never gotten around to read them (I'd read the first 50 pages then give up. LOL.) so when a friend of mine forwarded this to me saying a TV series will be produced from it, I thought why not give it a try? Especially since they say that it's a dumbed down version of what he usually writes. And I liked it, I did, with a few exemptions... The storytelling was unique"
6833,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,"Stephen King. For kids? Yeah, sometimes. Eyes of the Dragon is as close as King comes to being for all ages. This is a shift from most of King's other writings, but carries much of King's traditional thematic and style. Stephen King's world is connected to our own and it's in that world that all his stories hang out, blending together in fascinating and engaging ways. One can't help but see the connections in Dragon to other books; The Stand , It , The Dark Tower . Maybe it's just that I really like"
6834,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,"This is one of my favorite Stephen King books of all time. I was an avid Stephen King fan at an inappropriately young age, and devoured every one of his books I could get my hands on. The Eyes of the Dragon was purchased for me by a family member for my 10th birthday as a more age-appropriate book because he had written it for his daughter when she was young, so she could read her dad's work. It is by far less gory and dark than his regular works, but even as a die-hard fan I would not recommend"
6835,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,"Between the scattered pictures throughout the story and the easy concepts and vocabulary, The Eyes of the Dragon seems like it is a children's book. While the book is devoid of Stephen King's patented terror, it's still chock full of his wry humor and warped mind. This is definitely not for the little ones. The Eyes of the Dragon takes place in the same world as Stephen King's Dark Tower series and was the first book he published that was completely apart from the horror genre. The title mentions"
6836,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,"Oddly enough this is the only Stephen King I have ever read. I keep telling myself I will read others, but obviously I have a lot of things I want to read. When I think of this book I think the ultimate fairy tale. Okay, there is not really romance but still there is something so wonderful about the imperfect king, the benevolent queen and all the tiny details that make up this story. I don’t think this story belongs exclusively to Peter or anyone. The magician Flagg has been plotting the downfa"
6838,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,"I didn't expect I would like this one, because I'm not a fan of fantasy novels. Nor do I like it when Stephen King writes something for his children (this was written for his daughter) because you know its going to be a pretty tame read as far as violence and horror goes. But while I was a quarter way through this, it suddenly dawned on me that I was enjoying the book. It's very simply written, and there isn't anything particularly scary or intriguing about it, but all the same it is very entert"
6839,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,"This one's very fun. It's aimed at a younger sort of audience, I think, than Stephen King's other stuff like The Stand, so the tone is quite light. I like the narrative style -- the storyteller flavour of it. The story itself is quite simple, really, and quite fairytale ish, but the little details are really awesome -- the things that are mentioned early on and later become relevant, such as the doll's house. I found the presence of Flagg interesting, too. It's nothing terribly substantial, and t"
6840,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,"This book was, for me, an easy and enjoyable read. I liked the bits when the author spoke to me, the reader. The ending was rather predictable. I read the Kindle edition and was surprised by the misspelled words. Often Delain, the kingdom, was Detain and doll-house became do//-house. Perhaps that was a product of the process of making the book into a e-book. There seems to have been difficulty with the letter L. So, I liked it but wasn't all that impressed with my second Stephen King book. It's n"
6841,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,"I remember reading this in one sitting, about ten years ago, and loving it. In this very particular fairy-talesque setting, Stephen King does a great job of narrating the heroic adventures of Prince Peter, who assumes the throne of his late father King Roland. As the story unfolds, many amazing characters are introduced (Flagg as a villainous magician!) - some of them will try to overthrow Peter. A greatly underrated book!"
6842,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,"I remember reading this book years ago, before I even knew who Stephen King was. I came across it at our high school library, and thought it sounded interesting. As a fantasy lover, I was excited to reading this fairytale like book. I'm glad I did! It was very good and I wish that he would write more fantasy stories. The story really pulled me in and left me wanting to know what would happen next. If you are a fantasy lover, I would highly recommend giving this book a try."
6843,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,"When Stephen King's daughter Naomi was young, she had never read any of his books because she didn't like horror. He wrote this story for her so she could read one of his books. It's quite different from his other books because it's written more for children, and because it's sort of a fantasy/adventure story rather than horror. There's plenty of magic and suspense, and his exceptional storytelling skills are just as evident here."
6844,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,"I don't think that they called them YA books back in '87. But, back then spinning this fantasy tale for his daughter, I'm sure she was more then pleased with this tale. Adventurous young hero's,trying to save the young king.. a wicked old magician trying to keep him from being the new king. With the wonderful descriptions of the landscape and the feel of that cold and drafty castle, this was a fun yarn. Recommended reading for young fantasy fans."
6846,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,"I read it a long time ago. It'd be refreshing to read it again. A unique tale with all the classic items fully mastered twisted. Updated: 3.5 ( I have read a lot of fantasy books since then, so I guess it's normal that it didn't impressed me as much as younger but I really like it and I'm glad of rereading it again. With a few archetypical characters Stephen King has mastered an incredible bedtime read for children and a delightful and fast fantasy read for grown ups )"
6847,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,"This is my second Stephen King, and very happy to find out that he's not just write horror stories. The Eyes of the Dragon really hooked me up good. This book will have connection with the Dark Tower, they said. Definitely gonna be on my TBR. As King said on the last page of this book, ""But now the hour is late, and all of that us another tale, for another day."""
6848,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,1,"I'm not sure whether King was writing this one for kids or not. If so, maybe kids would like it. I thought it was very poor. I really can't get into King's fantasy. Without the horror backbone his work seems too fluffy."
6849,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,"The story was entertaining, but I'm just not a huge fan of traditional/medieval-style fantasy so it didn't really captivate my imagination. I just had it so I read it. The story was left open for a sequel at the end. Anyone know if a sequel was ever written?"
6852,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,"It is, as the editors said, a ""junior book"". But, meh, it's Stephen King, so I just had to read it."
6853,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,a simple fairytale feel...a light read but very pleasing..hard to put down the book..was sorry when the pages ran out...magnific..
6854,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,"Perched in their ivory towers and condemning any literature that does not meet their predefined requirements for excellence (those requirements being obfuscation and inaccessibility), the fiercest critics have had a lot to say about the writing of Stephen King. He has been described by some as an inadequate writer of nothing more than penny-dreadfuls, one who shares nothing in common with literary giants like Dickens and Poe. Speaking of his early work, Peter Straub summarised the views of the l"
6855,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,"I wrote a longer review on my wordpress site but I get a little side tracked discussing the difference between ""author blinders"" and artistic context, so here's a cut and paste of the more book specific part of my review. What you can expect from The Eyes of the Dragon is a predictable YA fantasy set up. Royal family. One distant parent, another dead. Two brothers, one the hero and one isn’t. One royal adviser who seemingly spends all their free time rubbing their hands together in a corner cackl"
6856,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,"I wouldn't call myself a Stephen King fan. I never have been. I have shied away from him in the past because I am not a fan of horror, unless you count the odd Poe short story back in college. But who doesn't like a little Poe now and then?...be honest. I have always had a kind of snobby, can-any-good-thing-come-out-Stephen-King kind of attitude, but I am now officially shamed. I am not overstating, when I say that Stephen King is phenomenal. The Eyes of the Dragon is one of the best books I hav"
6859,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,"King's foray into fantasy is cliched and predictable. The book is short and sweet, good for a quick read but nothing that'll stay back with you. The story follows the royal family of Delain: King Roland (who reminded me a lot of King Robert Baratheon of ASoIaF fame), his good queen Sasha, their sons- Peter and Thomas and last but not the least the magician Flagg. Flagg isn't a new character for a King reader. We've met him has The Walking Dude, The One Who Walks Among the Corns, Randall Flagg an"
6861,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,"The Eyes of the Dragon is the book that inspired Stephen King to write Misery . It's actually a double bind: some people were expecting horror from King, even though up to this point in his career, he had a pretty diverse output; others, still, may have expected that The Eyes of the Dragon would have more actual fantasy elements. Instead we have a tale of courtly intrigue and the unbreakable bonds of friendship, a breezy read told in a more conversational register than we're used to, where years"
6862,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,"Using core 'fairy tale' features such as medieval like settings, kings & Queens, castles with moats, peasants etc. King creates a delightful young adult fantasy of a dispossessed (of his kingdom) prince and how he set about righting the injustice... and the villain? You'll have to read it to find out :) A ever increasing 7 out of 12 :)"
6863,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,God I wish I'd read this when I was a kid! I think it would have had a great impact on my reading future. I tried to read it from that nearly innocent point of view and really enjoyed the adventure. A fun read.....worth rereading.
6864,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,I read this in High School and was happy to find that it still holds up. I think King has a real knack for fantasy. Love the setting and it's a nice fast read. I'd love to see King return to these characters some day.
6867,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,It's been nearly twenty years since I first read this one. I felt called to pick it up again. I love King's storytelling and underlying theme of good vs. evil. A classic for sure.
6868,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,Second time reading this was way better than the first time.
6869,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,"This is the first Stephen King book that I read, many moons ago. My son just read it and I wanted to remind myself why I loved it so much. It is so much fun! Like Game of Thrones for the 12-year-old set, or a dark fairy tale."
6870,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,"Delain, a symphonic metal band I listen to from the Netherlands, took their name from a Stephen King book. This is that book. I never bothered to look it up and now I know. One of the quicker reads by Mr. King, this one read like a children's fairy tale. Nice change from most of his other books. Flagg is in this one, being very Flaggish. There was also a character named Roland, who is not at all like the other Roland. No complaints from start to finish, though I wish the ending was extended a bi"
6871,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,"This fairy tale had a bit of everything that makes a good fairy tale: an evil wizard, a noble prince, loyal friends, etc. It is a story about good versus evil and how evil can use good people for their evil purposes. I enjoyed reading it, although there were some times that the story lagged a bit in the middle. I found myself routing for the good guys (but perhaps Peter was a little too good) and cheering when things didn't go the bad guy's way. The best characters were the flawed ones, but I al"

This had just one narrator, as oppossed to the half a dozen Sleeping Giants had, but was just as effective. He didn't overdo his accents, but was successful when he did them. He had this great menacing voice for Flagg that, at the same time, reminded me of: Benedict Cumberbatch's Smaug Dracula from Penny Dreadful Alan Rickman's Snape Ralph Fiennes's Voldemort (especially that whispery bit in the last movie when he's in everyone's heads) I'm so"
6874,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,"I have a confession to make: I've never read a Stephen King novel before. I've read several of his essays (and been quite impressed), but I'm just not a fan of horror as a genre. But I do love a good fantasy or a twisted fairy tale, which is precisely what we have in ""The Eyes of the Dragon."" And it's delightful. The plot is simple: an evil magician murders the king, frames the crown prince, and then proceeds to install the younger prince as king... a king whom the evil magician can control. But"
6875,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,"Oh, King. Why you do this? Why you try to take on an old and dated style and try to play in that world when it is most definitely not your world. Heck, you even throw in an allusion (one that others may not catch, but I read Stephen Crane's poetry ... and you quoted from what may be in the top ten most well known of his poems) to remind us, ""Hey! I'm Stephen King and this is what I do! See! Hey guys! This is an illusion! This all takes place in the realm of all stories! Wait, don't walk away! Lo"

If I weren't, I never would've picked this novel up, never would've experienced the captivating power that the story of Delain holds. I'm sure glad I did. Those of you who know me also know that I am not typically not a fan of fantasy, although I've read my share of it over the years. That was one reason I wasn't looking forward to reading this one. The other reason was that I didn't read anything that intrigued me in the syno"
6879,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,"I re-read this book to check if it was suitable for my 11 year old daughter to read. It's sometimes referred to as ""Stephen King for children"" but on re-read, I find that's not really true. There is some pretty direct sexual euphemisms at the beginning... how the ""King's sword hardened before the Queen's forge,"" frank talk about how babies get made, allusions to sexual violence. But more than that, you can't really tone down Stephen King's zeal for murder, torture and mayhem. The bad guy is REAL"
6880,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,2,"why i read stephen king when usually i am disappointed, the result is usually a two: it intrigues, interests, intimidates me, that he can write virtually anything and it appeals to an extensive readership. this is his attempt to self-consciously model something of fantasy, but the lack i feel is perhaps easily noted: magic is missing. not simply in the narrative, where what little magic deployed seems momentarily useful for political ends, but 'magic' is also missing in any literary sense... the"
6881,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,"I revisited this old friend for perhaps the 3rd or fourth time recently. As always, Stephen King is a master of creating a desire to turn yet another page, to read on just a bit more. This time around, however, I noticed afresh the strong connections to the Dark Tower series. While neither the knowledge or ignorance of the Dark Tower will adversely affect the reader's delight in going through this tale, I did find that I spent more time wondering and thinking about the other, much later, Roland"
6882,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,"I've always been jealous of people who remember their childhood well. I can hardly recall even a few things I enjoyed doing when I was a child. I do, however, remember how I used to read the books I liked at night, hiding under the blanket so my parents wouldn't have noticed. One of these books was Stephen King's The Eyes Of The Dragon. I find it's funny that I'm doing the very same thing now, and, though it's not by far as thrilling as it was with my parents constantly trying to catch me, it's"
6883,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,"I have to confess, this is the fourth time I've read this book. I first read it back in the 80s when I was kid (how I miss the 80s...), and I loved it then, and I love it now. It was the first Stephen King book I ever read (definitely not the last, although I didn't return to him properly until much later in life (mine and his)). Only King could write a story where the narrator is so present, so 'heavy' and make it all the more fulfilling because of it. Plus Flagg, for me, is one of the best cha"
6884,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,"One of my top three Stephen King favorites. This story is so unlike his usual horror theme, this one is very reminiscent of Neil Gaiman's fantasy stories in which an evil wizard tries to bring death and destruction to the kingdom. The story begins with King Roland and how he managed to sire two sons, even though he wasn't fond of women and the whole procreation process. The brothers, Peter and Thomas, are complete opposites and since the Queen died giving birth to Thomas, they grew up with a riva"
6885,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,"Stephen king wrote this book to apease his daughter, who was frightened by his other more grouesome novels. She liked when he would make up bedstories for her, and this was the ultimate bedtime story. It had knights, and kings, and princes, and dragons, and evil secrets.... I read this many many years ago and thought this was one of kings greatest novels ever... still to this date! Excellent writing and interesting, as he never wrote another like it in all the following years..... Bravo on the fa"
6886,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,"This is a reread from high school that was sadly far too many years ago. Still highly enjoyable, the gradual buildup to the conclusion will definitely wear on your nerves. Encompassing several assassinations, a royal prince wrongly accused, and an demon sorceror hell bent on seeing his wretched evil plans brought to fruition - the driving force of this book is how in the world will justice be served? Never fear, things might not always go as one would think, but many wrongs are righted very sati"
6887,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,"I wouldn't know this was a Stephen King book if his name wasn't on the cover. the light hearted, jaunty story telling was surprising from him. Not a whole lot happens in the plot and I almost predicted exactly what happened. However when I was fourteen I would have loved this story. As an adult I only like it. As a fantasy novel its okay I have certainly read better, but its much nicer than I expected it to be. Its a light hearted easy read. However if you want a light hearted action filled fanta"
6889,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,"I didn't know Uncle Stevie had it in him to be this charming. This is a traditional fantasy story, almost a fairy-tale (which means I'm already inclined to love it anyway), with some King-style added in there for good measure (talkative narrator, great eye for details and use of motifs, character depth in unexpected places). Also, the ""eyes"" of the dragon did not turn out to be what I expected them to be, which made me absurdly happy for some reason. Really, really enjoyed this one. It's like a h"
6890,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,"I'm not sure why I hadn't read this book sooner, as Stephen King is one of my favorite authors. This was an enjoyable fairy-tale type story of evil plots, jealousy, and a wrongly imprisoned Prince. Was it my favorite work of Mr. King's? No. But it was a great example of the type of stories he can weave that draw the reader in. However, I much prefer the OTHER saga featuring a Roland and Flagg. :) (2016 reading challenge category: a book that was published more than 10 years ago)"
6891,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,"My first ever Stephen King book I read as a kid and still my very favorite. It's a quick read, it's magical, suspenseful, and narrated BRILLIANTLY by Bronson Pinchot. He has the creepiest most perfect Flagg voice ever and embodied every character with distinction and clarity. I'm so glad I read this again and wanted to start it over as soon as it was done. An absolute classic, and unlike any other Stephen King book you'll read."
6892,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,"This book seemed to be aimed at a much younger audience than the author usually writes for -- I would estimate young adult, perhaps even earlier. It was an interesting book, with a story that built up slowly -- perhaps too slowly, but I was trying to keep in mind the audience level. The climax was rather delicious, but the resolution was over too quickly. The one odd thing about the book was the complete lack of chapters."
6894,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,"What can I say other than I thoroughly enjoyed this book, the characters, the story, the whole shebang. And the story, it was a charming fairy tale written by the deliciously demented and mega talented Stephen King. And strangely, it remained as just that, a fairy tale. Frankly, I kept waiting for the deaths and misery and scares galore. They never came. So, so glad I picked up this book."
6897,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,"I picked this book up as it was recommended to me by a member of a goodreads group I am active in. I would not normally read much Young Adult Fiction and although I have enjoyed the Stephen King books I have read, I wouldn't say I was a big fan. Needless to say, I was quite apprehensive about picking this up but I'm pleased I did as it was a thoroughly enjoyable read."
6899,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,"Stephen King is definitely one of the best at developing characters! I enjoyed the good guys, enjoyed the middle men and loathed the villain. A very enjoyable (shorter than usual for SK) fantasy read."
6900,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,"3,5. This book was written for King's 13 years old daughter, because she haven't ready any of his books and liked fantasy. With that in mind, it is a pretty good book, but not mutch profound. Aways use your napikins, kids."
6901,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,2,"Too much fantasy, too much fairytale and too much children's book. My least favorite King. The Swedish translation enhances the ""children's book"" feel and so, if you are a completist and are to read it, I would strongly suggest the English version."
6902,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,"A quick & easy read, also a pretty predictable story. It has a few neat moments. Read this if you are trying to get all the extra story tidbits on the dark tower series. Recommended"

6906,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,"This is ranked in my top three King books. Maybe number one. I love every bit of this story. I usually reread The Eyes of the Dragon yearly. I highly suggest this for any reader, King fan or not."
6907,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,"This is a fun light read despite the author. It's a great story of a kingdom and a magician. Pretty simple story, but written in a narration style that was very entertaining"
6908,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,2,"Think this was my first King in English, I have it in Swedish as well. No matter what language, I just can't get into the fairytale feel of this one."
6909,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,"3.5 . I've read it in lithuanian, and I have to say that translation was pretty...weird. To say the least. Anyway, I kinda enjoyed this book though fantasy is not one of my favorite genres."
6910,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,"Great book! It is a tie into with The Stand and Dark Towers. The villain, Flagg, is in each story. Even though this is a YA book, the story is delightful for all ages."
6911,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,Fuck Flagg tho
6912,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,"I was finally able to start my goal of reading The Dark Tower series with this book! I know this isn't technically part of the series, but it serves as a type of prequel as it shares a villain with the series. I was excited to get to this book, so I was kind of disappointed that I didn't like it more. There was nothing terribly bad about it, but there also wasn't much that was terribly good. I didn't connect to any of the characters, and the writing style just didn't agree with me. On the bright"
6913,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,"The Eyes of the Dragon exhibits Stephen King at his most innocuous and least abbrasive level. However, this novel also seems to have lost a little bit of King's spirit in exchange for less graphic material. For example, in King's novel Misery, he fearlessly puts his characters through gore and profanity, as well as sexual content and plaguing fears. The Eyes of the Dragon appeals to a younger audience than King's other novels, but the author is not totally out of his depth. He busts out the mor"
6914,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,"The Eyes of the Dragon is decidedly a minor entry in Stephen King's catalog of work, and deservedly so. It is apparently set in the same ""Mid-World"" as the Dark Tower series, though generally has little actual connection to those longer and better books. Still, Eyes of the Dragon has its own enjoyments, as long you keep your expectations in check. It's a fantasy novel with all the tropes that come with that designation: dragons, castles, royalty, magic. King has dabbled occasionally in fantasy (D"
6915,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,"This book was an interesting read, because it was more like a piece of epic fantasy than a work of horror. In fact, King himself faced a backlash after the book was released, and the subsequent furore inspired the plot of Misery, with Annie’s obsession acting as a metaphor for his demanding, dissatisfied readers. It’s a shame, because speaking personally, I loved it. In fact, it’s refreshing to see King flexing a different set of authorial muscles, and it certainly proved a point – the man knows"
6917,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,"Sometimes you are surprised. Stephen King has long been associated with horror, and deservedly so. His career began with works like Carrie , Christine , Firestarter , The Shining and so on, all designed to scare the everlovin' out of any poor soul who picked up the book - and usually succeeding. What's more, the books often became movies, thereby allowing that segment of the population who doesn't read much to be terrified. So for years, King has been called one of the scariest authors alive. I've se"
6918,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,"I am a die-hard King fan. Some of his novels are in my top favorites - The Stand and The Green Mile to name two. However, the fantasy genre is my love and I do not believe that Mr. King ""owns"" this area of literature like he does horror (if you want to label the majority of his work as such). I have not enjoyed his Gunslinger series nor The Eyes of the Dragon nearly as much as his other works. They are pale comparisons, to me, of other novels in fantasy and of his other stories. That being said,"
6920,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,"As an avid Stephen King reader, I was prepared to go on a reading marathon with The Eyes of the Dragon while having goosebumps from word after word. But unexpectedly, this book turned out to be something that, in my opinion, is completely different from Stephen’s usual horror/thrillers. It turned out to be set in a realm of fantasy. Having said that, The Eyes of the Dragon was an easy story to get into and intriguing from the first page with its elaborate plot and well developed characters. Some"
6921,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,"This was Stephen King's foray in to the genre of fantasy and he succeeded spectacularly! This is a book that I've put off reading because I didn't expect it to be very good. I don't generally like fantasy because the characters are generally underdeveloped in favor of a strong, complicated plot. The main characters in this book were well developed. The plot was strong but linear. If you're a fan of the Dark Tower series, this is a must-read. I listened to the audiobook version on Overdrive from B"
6922,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,"It's getting close to 25 years since I last read this book as a fantasy-obssessed teen. Moments came flooding back to me as I flew through this brief tale, for moments are what King focused on most here. It's almost a Reader's Digest version of an epic, keeping the plot lean and the detail even leaner as we trip merrily through an awfully long period of time in a tidy length. Of most interest here is the character of Flagg, recognisable from The Stand (and elsewhere). Several large clues link him"
6923,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,"The Eyes of the Dragon is one of Stephen kings first take on fairy tale . And although it’s not a bad story and I did enjoy it. It’s quite different from any other Stephen King story and not because it’s fantasy but because it’s a fantasy story that reads like a storybook. In fact I wouldn’t be surprised if the adaptation of this story was an animation rather than live action. Although it is a good story, I feel like it just falls flat compared to to any of his other stories, especially after re"
6924,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,"I really enjoyed this book. It's certainly less creepy/horror-based than his more well-known works, which some long time fans may not like. For anyone who has been put off reading Stephen King because of that, though, this would be a great place to start. The tone of the story narration brought to mind a kindly storyteller by a fire, and greatly reminded me of CS Lewis. That said, this is probably not a book for younger children, as there's just enough creepiness to remind you this is in fact St"
6925,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,"If you aren't a fan of this author's other books, you should still check this one out. It's sort of historical fantasy with a little of a fairytale feel maybe. It is back in the times of ruling kings and has magicians and such. I recommend it for all ages. It's probably more of a young adult or maybe even middle grade. It's a little harsher on everything not going perfectly compared to some middle grade books, but it's definitely not like his adult horror. I'm enjoying how little bits of his boo"
6926,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,"I’ve probably read this book more times than any other. It was my favorite story as a kid, although it has been 20 years since I last read it. It still gives me everything I could ask for from a standalone fantasy novel aimed at a younger reader. There are many books that I remember as being “favorites” from the past, but many times reading them years later you discover that nostalgia played a big part in your love for it. So I was delighted to find that I still have crazy affection for this one"
6927,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,"I haven't read this since High School. I enjoyed it, but I can't decide if I like that it tries to be both epic and brief at the same time. On the one hand it was a fun quick read that kept me engaged, and that enjoyment might have been lost if it tried to be The Lord of the Rings. On the other hand, having enjoyed many books like The Lord of the Rings, there were a lot of moments that I might have enjoyed a little more detail about. As a result, it did feel a little bit like a YA version of an epi"
6928,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,"More like a really long short-story than a full blown novel, the story is essential reading for fans of The Stand and the The Gunslinger series and maybe other books I have yet to read. The book may also interest fans of other serial adventures: The chapter illustrations, castles, wizards, even a hero with a lightning bolt scar on his face. King's influence is broad and deep."
6929,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,"I enjoyed the story and the idea of it but the thing that threw me off the most was the writing style, especially in the first half of the book. He would tell you a major spoiler in his own way then proceed to go back in time and tell how it happened, with the reader already knowing the result, which can be alright for some people but not for me. The second half was much better than the first half though and much more fast-paced."
6931,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,"An amazing fantasy tale full of murder, sibling rivalry, jealousy, loyalty, betrayal, and much more. Anyone who knows me personally knows I am a huge Stephen King fan, and with that being said, The Eyes of The Dragon is definitely one of my favorite novels of his. King writes mostly of horror and supernatural, but he is amazing at fantasy too. I also love how this novel has a connection to The Dark Tower Series and The Stand because of the main villain and other little hints, although this novel"
6934,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,"This was an interesting fantasy novel from Stephen King. It wasn't what I expected, but I enjoyed it. It had a lot of wit, humor, sarcasm, napkins and boogers. I could have done without the obsession on the last two items, but it was still enjoyable, nonetheless. It was longer than it needed to be, but I didn't think it dragged on too painfully. My favorite part was the ending. It was not what I was expecting, but it made me think, ""Yeah, right on!"" King made the storyline work very well."
6935,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"A tale of a bond between humans and animals at its finest level. Fool’s Errand is the first book in the Tawny Man trilogy—the third out of five subseries within Hobb’s The Realm of the Elderlings gigantic series—and it is my favorite installment within the entire RotE so far. This is seriously a lovely, memorable, and poignant return to the world of Fitz, Nighteyes, and the Fool’s journey. Honestly, after the disappointment I had with the last installment of the Farseer trilogy, and after the gre"
6936,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"The characterisation of Fitschivalry through the series is brilliant. The books are told from the first person entirely; thus the reader witnesses the change in his thoughts as he grows into a man. In this book, he has developed a new persona: Tom Badgerlock. This is set fifteen years after the Red Ship wars and King Verity’s reawakening of the Dragons. Tom Badgerlock is the person Fitschivalry has evolved into: the one he always wanted to be; he is the man with a simple life, a small farm, a fe"
6937,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"I went into this story with zero expectation. My poor heart was still very tender after the beating it got in Assassin’s Quest. But then I saw everyone reading one or the other Fitz book and going ga ga over. I kept thinking, “did we read the same Fitz stories?” to find the answer I thought why not give another chance to Fitz, perhaps he did better in this. And oh boy, this book simply blew me away. All my complaints of Fitz being whinny and doing nothing went out of the wind. Ms. Hobb what did"
6938,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"Again, Robin Hobb demonstrates that you don’t need to write grimdark to generate realism, high drama, or sinister undertones. Now I love my grimdark as much as Hannibal loves liver *phphpht* , but Hobb’s realism is expressed in believable characters, complex relationships, detailed worldbuilding...wait wait wait a minute now...what about blood and guts? Yes, there will be blood too, but the joojoo is not in the gore - the joojoo is in the sustained threat of violence - the joojoo is in the way th"
6939,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"Do not you sense it? A crossroads, a vertex, a vortex. All paths change from here. This book made my cry. Multiple times. I don't often cry while reading books. I takes a lot. And I might blame it on pregnancy hormones except Hobb made me cry in her last two series Liveship Traders and Farseer Trilogy and when I read those I wasn't pregnant. But this book again has ruined me. In a good way. Robin Hobb is the type of author that slowly builds her story. She introduces her character and you live their"
6940,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"This is more or less what I look like whenever FitzChivalry Farseer is involved: So many books later, and I’m still feeling überprotective of Fitz. I got furious with his neighbour when he attacked Fitz in the market place, I wanted to kick Starling out of the door (and none too gently), and I was even too angry to cry when the inevitable happened (view spoiler) [and Nighteyes dies. It was 500 pages in the making and still I was shocked (hide spoiler) ] . What Robin Hobb manages to do is quite amazin"

I think I hate them like I do because they are so damn realistic. Never the happy ending to anything. Only the harsh and brutal reality. The main character is brave. And good. Lovable. He is also a fool. A wimp. That makes mistakes. That you yell ""WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING!?"" at. Same for other characters. One moment you scream your head of at them. The next you sit there grinn"
6944,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"This is book #1 in the Tawny Man series, which follows on from the events of the Farseer books and the Liveship books. This series relates a lot more to the characters from the initial Farseer books such as Fitz, the Fool and various other characters, both old and new, who are local to Bukkeep. We are told that the main character (first-person again) of Fitz is now 35, so it's about 15 years after the Farsser series. As we follow Fitz we don't actually know an awful lot about the life he's been l"
6945,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"I am broken. My love for Fitz and the Fool is strong as ever, but my heart is broken from the events of this book. I didn't cry, but I screamed. Also, Fitz and the Fool... I ship it. So damn hard!"
6946,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"When I say I couldn't put it down, I mean I couldn't put it down. This 661 page book took me about 24 hours to finish. I listened to it on audio and I couldn't disconnect myself. I listened during my commute, during work, during cooking, during putting my kids to bed. It was so great to reconnect with old characters and watch how they have matured. This book is set almost 15 years after Assassin's Quest. Fitz is no longer whiny and misguided. The Fool is no longer mean spirited. Additionally, I"
6947,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"This is my third time of reading this series and it still remains my absolute favourite! Fitz, Fool and of course Nighteyes are absolute heroes and can do no wrong in my eyes. Wishful thinking below, but who cares and I may get my wish come true in the new series, you never know!"
6948,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"It was a strange transition from the pace of the Liveship Traders to the pace of this trilogy, told (like the Farseer trilogy) entirely in first person from Fitz’s perspective. Fitz is a thorough scribe, to say the least, and this is definitely a set-up book (the main plot doesn’t begin until 200 pages in). But I appreciated this for its quiet steadiness, and found myself getting surprisingly emotional over passing moments of dialogue and introspection. I absolutely can’t wait to read the next t"
6949,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"Another great book about our hero Fitz. I especially love reading about him for some reason, and this book was no exception. I can't go too much into the story since it's a continuation of the long series Robin Hobb has created, but I can say that I liked how we get to follow Fitz at an older age - and I LOVED that this novel contains cats :D I'm definitely going to continue on with this series once Autumn really sets in."
6950,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"Fool's Errand picks up 15 years after the events of Assassin's Quest . Fitz is living a quite life in a cottage with a boy he adopted and his loyal wolf Nighteyes. Naturally, things can't stay quiet for poor Fitzy Fitz. Adventure comes to his door in the shape of Chade, followed by the Fool. The first 5 chapters or so deal primarily with catching up with Fitz and finding out what's been going on in his life. In any other writer's hands this would be tedious but Hobb slowly reveals his past in a ta"
6951,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"So good to be back in the world of the Six Duchies. Fitz is a grown man now and was living a rather relaxed life for a change. That couldn't last forever.

6953,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"I often have problems with sequels... BUT NOT THIS ONE!! Robin Hobb delivers with amazing character development, great plot, twists, and brings in great new characters in the first book of The Tawny Man trilogy!

Much more of an adventure story than the first Fitz series with some nice links to the previous Liveship trilogy. Excellent story, some new characters and a moment of sheer tear scorching heartbreak. Brilliant."

Her other books moved at a much faster pace than this one. I still enjoyed the writing, but it definitely felt slow going. It also seemed very singular in plot focus. But with that being said, those are my only two complaints. I love her writing. It is vibrant and clear. She does world building well. She gives the reader wonderful characters you can root fo"

6960,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"I really enjoyed getting back into the bastard's world, although honestly, most of the novel was pastoral and catching up with the main character after almost two decades of living without adventure. When the story picked up, the intrigue was decent and the developments hinted at greater things for the future. It was almost like enjoying his comfortable life was a well earned and just reward for what happened to him as a child. Being drawn back into the world of royalty seemed inevitable because"

If you like Hobb and her previous two trilogies about the Elderlings Realm, you'll want to continue. Here, we're back to the first person narrative of Fitz himself, and it's great to catch up with old friends. The story itself is decent enough, but what struck me about this particular book was the slow build. True, this is a staple of long Hobb books, but here is where it real"
6962,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,3,"The first half is meh; second half better meh While I did end up enjoying it, it was just so slow and boring yet it still manages to bring a major case of the feels.(still reeling over that one) The characters are,like always, excellent but they're different and while it's more realistic I still wanted more of younger Fitz. Hopefully the next book is much better but after 6 book I fully trust Robin Hobb and am extremely excited the next two books in the trilogy"

But second, because they're a serious time investment and I have a constant stream of books coming into and out of my life, needing to be read. But it was convention time, and Ms. Hobb was the guest of honor, so what better experience than to be reading one of her books while hanging out in the same hotel? I figured I'd get the story of The Fool."

I noticed starting with this one, but Ship of Magic suffers from it too. It seems as though it is hard for her to get started and there is time more or less s"

I really enjoyed re-reading the first trilogy, seeing Fitz and his friends so young, but I particularly enjoy older Fitz. Lots of great new characters, grand adventure, loss, love, and all things that make a great book. Another beautiful book in a long series of beautiful books. On to the next one!"

When I started this book, I expected to like it, but that I would have some reservations, because the Six Duchies books aren't my favourites. The Liveship Traders is my favourite trilogy so far, as Assassins unfortunately failed to capture me in quite the same way. This was mainly due to the fact that Fitz (the protagonist) annoyed me somewhat."

He lives a quiet life, tending to his home and garden while raising his boy. Of course, things never stay too quiet for Fitz. Chade and the Fool come knocking on his door. Prince Dutiful is missing, and it's up to Fitz to save him. The book starts off catching up with Fitz.

6979,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"Hang in there for the slow start; it really build up the characters of the protagonists for the readers to relate and to enjoy the rest of the story. When the book ends, I actually long to read the next book in the series. Great writing, awesome plot development, and beautiful prose. Narration by James Langton was skillfully done. Highly recommended. I would love to see Jake Gyllenhaal play FitzChivalry Farseer in film. Don't you agree?"

6982,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"My love for Fitz, the Fool and Nighteyes knows no bounds Fanart for the feels by SophieAlteaki Maybe the Liveship Traders is the most popular Hobb series because it adheres to fantasy rules the most out of Hobb's other trilogies; multiple POVs, epic battle scenes, ship wars, dragons, unique world and lore and heart stopping action. And then you have Fitzchivalry Farseer's adventures, slower paced, more in line with the traditional fantasy worlds, not that much action, narrated only from Fitz's poi"
6983,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"4.5 stars. I so thoroughly enjoyed being back with these characters. I took my time reading this because I didn't want it to end. There was a point in this book where I cried, and another time where I sat there numbly for a minute and couldn't go on reading for a few hours. At this point it's rare for me to become as emotionally invested in a book as I was in this."
6984,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,Brilliant. Just brilliant.
6985,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"Find this and many other reviews over at Geekritique ! Robin Hobb has written many books in her far-reaching Realm of the Elderlings series. Her most notable, perhaps, would be the novels chronicling the life of FitzChivalry Farseer, the bastard son of Prince Chivalry and all the trials and struggles beset him. Fitz is one of the most tormented souls in all of fantasy, giving even the Starks a run for their money. Introduced first in the Farseer trilogy, Fitz' story continues in the Tawny Man tril"
6986,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,3,"Fool’s Errand by Robin Hobb is the start of The Tawny Man Trilogy, a series that I have been wanting to read for years. I waited until a great time and this year, after reading The Liveship Trader Trilogy, it seemed like the right time. Fool’s Errand is the first book in Robin Hobb’s third trilogy in her Elderling Series and is an epic fantasy in first person. The first trilogy, Farseer Trilogy, is one of my favorite trilogies of all time and Fitz, The Fool, and Nighteyes are some of my favorite"

A child sees the acorn of his daily life, but a man looks back on the oak.” “Death is always less painful and easier than life! You speak true. And yet we do not, day to day, choose death. Because ultimately, death is not the opposite of life, but the opposite of choice. Death is what you get when there are no choices left to make.” Somehow I have"
6988,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"Robin Hobb's writing is brilliant. She goes into so much depth and detail with the characters and their interactions that even though this is a fantasy universe, the characters seem so real. The conversations are some of the most realistic I've read and the dialogue is incredibly well done. For roughly the first 200 pages we are catching up with Fitz and not a whole lot really happens. I don't think any other author could do this and make it as interesting as Hobb does. She manages to be captiva"
6989,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"After 10 hours of near non-stop reading, I have finished reading this extraordinary book. After beginning with the Farseer triology and progressing to the Liveship triology, I picked up the Tawny Man triology with a near maniacal need for more. Robin Hobb has created a fantasy universe the likes of which modern Fantasy has never seen. The Fool's Errand is one of the most emotionally draining books I have ever read. Not even Martin in his SoIaF series has affected me so deeply. Similar to the Far"

Because I can’t help myself hoping that something great awaits him which will worth all the misery and pain endured by now. (view spoiler) [Vain hopes so far… (hide spoiler) ] And because this series stands between Liveships Traders and Rain Wild Chronicles and I don’t want to miss anything, taking into consideration that they are related in some aspects. And, of course, because Robin Hobb is such a great storyteller. She crea"
6991,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,Much preferred to the first Fitz trilogy but maybe because the Fitz books are so well integrated into this. It also worked really well for me because I read the first trilogy nearly 20 years ago and so I have been away from the world of Buck keep as long as Fitz himself had! My only minor niggle is that the first third of the book was very slow and by the end of that section I was on the verge of getting restless for some action. Loved this book :)
6993,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,My favorite Robin Hobb book yet. I really related to the older FitzChivalry more and also like the story line. I was glad he wasn't going to spend the entire rest of his life in hiding.
6996,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"Executive Summary: This is another great entry in the Realm of the Ederlings. It picks up not long after the Liveship Traders and 15 years after the Farseer Trilogy. If you enjoyed those previous books, I imagine you will enjoy this one as well. If you haven't read those books, I highly recommend you do before starting this one. Full Review Like all the previous books in the Realm of the Ederlings books, this starts off slow without much indication as to what the main plot will be. In a lot of boo"
6997,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"This is probably closer to a 3.5 star. I picked this up without reading any of the Farseer books or the Liveship books or indeed any of Robin Hobbs other Books. I regret this majorly and if you are reading this review and are in the same situation GO BACK! Read the other books first. Saying that did enjoy this book a lot –Nighteyes reminded me so much of my Dog, Scamp, who sadly passed away last year it was bitter sweet to be reminiscing of her whilst reading. I really loved his humour and thought"
6998,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,3,"It’s a difficult trick – finishing one trilogy, and then starting another with the same set of characters. There’s so much to catch on, so much to get up to speed with, so much to refresh the readers’ memories of. It’s unsurprising then that the first half of ‘Fool’s Errand’ doesn’t burst out of the traps. Instead there’s a hell of a lot of sitting around a remote cottage reminiscing. Frankly, it’s a good thing nearly everyone reading this is at least three books invested, as it wouldn’t be the"
6999,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"Spoilers!!! What a pleasure to come across Fitz and the Fool again. 15 years have passed since the end of Royal Assassin, and Fitz is no longer FitzChivalry Fraseer, the witted bastard everyone believes is long dead. He is now known as Tom Badgerlock, a farmer. I loved getting a full account of what happened to him since we've last seen him, dreaming about carving his own dragon with Nighteyes. His meeting with Chade was heart worming and dream shattering at the same time, but ever since the Fool,"

I'm actually glad we started here. While there were a lot of references to the ""past,"" I really enjoyed getting to know the characters at these ages. Now, before we go on, we will go back and read the first one. I'm e"
7001,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed this series - the political maneuvering, the complex plotlines, the multi-dimensional characters. In a way, this was a protracted happy-ending for the first trilogy. It is difficult to express what I love about this series without giving the plot away. Suffice to say, I found the Fool's gift to Fitz from the Girl on the Dragon a philosophical and profound answer to some of the unanswered questions in the first. I am not too certain who did the growing up, I, the reader or Fi"
7003,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"Loved it. I'm four books into this series now and I love Fitz and I love the Fool and I thought this book was excellent. If I had a complaint is that the plot took a bit too long to develop. I thought the story lingered a bit too long with Fitz at his little cottage - once Fitz left things got moving and I couldn't stop turning pages. There's a part at the end of the book that had me in tears....it wasn't a surprise, but it broke my heart. Side note - I skipped the Liveship series and went strai"

As with the prior series, it is told in first person, from the viewpoint of Fitzchivalry Farseer, aka Tom Badgerlock. The Tawny Man (The Fool, Lord Golden) also plays a key role, as does Nighteyes the wolf, as well as spymaster Councellor Chade and Queen Ketricken. We also meet some new characters, most notably Thick the musical skiller and Prince Dutiful. Good story, if longer than I like, and the pace"

Fitz and Fool reunion was nice. I enjoyed the Fool's new scandalous persona, Lord Golden. Great to meet Nighteyes again. I always love reading about Wit-bond. And the wolf was as feisty as I remembered. But no thanks Hobb for breaking my heart, yet again. She broke my heart so many times now. And those damned cats. Cats are evil, most of them. If I had"

Here, some of the Elderling secrets were revealed but there is not a strong connection between Fitz's world, at least not yet. Therefore Fool's Errand starts with reminders about the previous adventures of Fitz. 15 years passed since the Red Ship Wars from The Farseer Trilogy.

I'll wait until I finish the series to give a ""full review,"" but for now, just a few points: I have never read A Song of Ice and Fire, but I've watched Game of Thrones through the first four seasons, and I still don't forgive George R.

Robin Hobb is one of those writers. It's been years since I read the Farseer trilogy, but it wasn't long before I was once again well acquainted with Fitz and Nighteyes and The Fool. I hadn't even realised how much I missed them. But even more than the beloved characters, or the immersive worl"
7019,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"Usually I am not sure about visiting old characters particularly after awesome and arduous adventures. However the sort of slow beginning to this book adjusts you to this idea and builds up to where Fitz can go on another adventure. It is certainly a different sort of Fitz to what we have known in the Farseer trilogy and he is older, wiser and still suffering from the past. I liked those elements as people do change from their experiences and with age and his relationships with old friends are a"

No kidding! This book ... it's like it's written just for me (thank's Robin H!) - like the author followed just my receipt for The Perfect Book. And the main reason for my enormous love is the characters we follow. I am utterly in lov"
7022,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"Fitz returns, in an even more character-driven, intimate and introspective story, that takes a record time to get going, but still manages to throw in some excitement along the way, not to mention some very emotional moments. Probably requires reading at least the Farseer Trilogy first, and reading the Liveship Traders, while not essential, probably helps (though I didn't, the first time). Not for people who don't like slow rumination. For lovers of Fitz, however, this isn't just back to the qual"
7023,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"My reviews usually contain my reactions/feelings after finishing the book and my opinion on the writing. I don't go into summarizing the story at all. So, this far into The Realm of Elderlings universe , there's no point in me writing a review for the rest of the books in this saga because the world building, the character arcs and the writing have been awesome since the first book and I'm more than positive that it is so for the rest of the series. FitzChivalry's character development is as gut"

Nighteyes: You should leave off sniffing the carcass of your old life, my brother. You may enjoy unending pain. I do not. There is no shame in walking away from bones, Changer...Nor is there any special wisdom in injuring oneself over and over. What is your loyalty to that pain? To abandon it will not lesson you."

This book is A+ much better than the last Farseer book because there has been practically no whining from Fitz about Moooollllyyyyyy.

I was really looking forward to read this book after a fantastic Live ship traders trilogy, but after a good start to this book, things started to go down gradually and I just could not take it much longer.

7039,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"My eyes are all cried out, and my heart is so full! This instalment was probably my favourite so far of the Farseer story. I loved it because it was so well paced, I never was bored during the 600 pages. And it was a formula that I loved, it reminded me of Fitz’s mission in Jjaampe. I loved that we met my favourite characters again, except it was rude not to include Patience and BARELY any Burrich or Kenddriken. It made up for it, however, by featuring the Fool for at least half of the book! And"

I loved Hobb's Liveship Traders trilogy but Fitz and the Fool hold a special place in my heart and I'm glad to be spending time with them again.

The first three books (The Farseer Trilogy) establish the world, magical systems, main characters and big plot developments and conflicts of this series. They were wonderful in character development, writing style and overall originality but not without their problems. Mainly, I felt Hobb tried to do too much and there were too"
7043,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"After taking a break from reading the first six of Robin Hobb’s Realm of the Elderlings series I decided I was hungry for more. Hobb is one of my favourite female fantasy authors, and the seventh instalment of this series was every bit as good as the first six. After the events of the Liveship Trader trilogy, we travel back to the Six Duchies. Some fifteen years after the end of Assassin’s Quest, Fitzchivalry Farseer lives a quiet life away from the politics of the kingdom with his wolf Nighteyes"
7044,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,audiobook narrated by James Langton Fool's Errand takes place years after the events of Robin Hobb's Farseer trilogy and does not disappoint. The story is as well written as Hobb's previous works and is great from beginning to end. The story kind of fills the gap between the trilogies and explains in greater detail the events concluding the Farseer trilogy while also building into this new adventure. The story is kind of broken into a summation of past events and then embarking on something new. T
7045,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,It was amazing. It's one of those books that I will definitely always remember and I know I will read it again. It's way better than any of the books of Farseer Trilogy which I really liked but it took me some time to get into it. And I gave Farseer Trilogy 5 stars...now I wish I could give Fool's Errand at least 6 stars. It had me hooked from the very beginning. One of the reasons is that Fitz is a grown man now. I liked him as a child or very young man but sometimes I wanted him to finally grow
7046,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,3,"After completing the Fool's Errand I realise I both love and hate the book, which is not altogether an unfamiliar feeling when I read Hobb. I will not delve deep into describing the book in detail, for those who read this book already know who Fitz is and how his world is build. There are many things in this book which I loved and many which put me off. It to me, was like a song, parts of which elate your heart and parts which you know are out of place. The book opens with Fitz and Nighteyes givi"
7047,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"Ah, Fitz, Fitz, Fitz! You are still my hero, but there were times I didn't like you very much in this book. But, that's the beauty of Robin Hobb's writing. Her characterization is brilliant and amazing, creating complex, believable and realistic individuals who possess as many flaws and foibles as they do strengths and good qualities. The reader can feel invested in them and can share their every doubt, conflict and emotion. And, this applies not only to the human characters, but the animal ones"
7048,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"I'm finally back in the world of Hobb! This is the third trilogy in her vast Realm of the Elderlings books. The first Farseer trilogy is best series I've ever read, so I'm thrilled to be back with some of my favorite characters. This installment follows up with beloved (and not so beloved) characters fifteen years after the conclusion of the Red Ship Wars. Peace has finally been attained, but is unsurprisingly tenuous. I do not recommend reading the descriptions on the back of these books! Go to"
7050,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"“He came one late, wet spring, and brought the wide world back to my doorstep.” This was the first line and once I read it, I have to admit, I squealed. I cannot begin to express how much I love Robin Hobb's characters, and Fitz more than anyone else. This is written in first-person, so we get the entire story from Fitz's POV, and it's a POV that's flawed but feels justified when you read things from his perspective. The way Hobb writes the subtle changes in his thoughts and perspective is master"

I looked it up and found out that this is the 1st book in the 3rd trilogy set in this world, so I put it down and pick up the real first book Assassin's apprentice. Robin Hobb's stories are very character oriented and she does well investing just enough effort into her characters to hook the reader right away. I have noticed that some authors need a significant number of pages to develop plot lines that in"

Fitz has been living with his adoptive son Hap and his wolf Nighteyes in seclusion away from the Farseer trappings. But he is drawn back in after the disappearance of Prince Dutiful. Alright. If you didn't fall in love with these characters by Assassin's Quest there's not much here to change your mind. Not much actually happens. And it is different from any other Hobb book as it can be described as a"
7053,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"3.75 out of 5 stars -- see this review and others at The Speculative Shelf . It is so good to see these characters again after three books away. When we last left FitzChivalry Farseer, his story had ended in a place that I was comfortable with and he seemed to be at peace. I was initially apprehensive about his return to action, but author Robin Hobb eventually coaxed me back -- just as Chade and The Fool do for Fitz. As such, our now-unretired protagonist must use his magical Wit and Skill to tra"

Series 9/10: The Tawny Man blends some characters and situations from Hobb's first two series. This series again focuses on Fitz, the main character from the Farseer series. I think the more narrow focus really helps. Relationships are more detailed and Fitz is an incredible character. Not a ton of things happ"

I was a little lost at first, as my reading of Farseer was a couple of years ago, but I got caught up in the story again quite soon and enjoyed every minute of it. I can't remember the last time a book made me break out in spontaneous sobs like this one.... well, that's not quite true. It happened last in Warhost of Vastmark , about a year and a half ago. So on to Golden Fool . Fitz' story is"
7058,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"4.5 stars It was so good to get back to Fitz. To read Robin Hobb is to be lost in another world and be taken on a rollercoaster journey. My emotions reading this varied wildly from comforted, happy, sad, impatient and furious. As usual with books I love, I can barely find any words to describe it. Reading Robin Hobb is to know that you won't be disappointed, except when you try to find other books that can match that standard. The story could have been taken in a variety of directions with this boo"

It was engrossing and it felt very easy to get lost in it, in a good way. The ending - after the climax (literary terms? in English?

I've read a book or two from this series in English, but most were in Bulgarian, hence with most of the names translate"
7060,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"I had forgotten how amazing this book really is! I was only about 13 when I read it for the first time, and many things in it were too complex for me to appreciate at the time. This time reading it, almost ten years later, I could not put it down and I loved every second of it, though I am a bit of an emotional wreck right now. My heart aches for Fitz, and The Fool, and Nighteyes, and Dutiful ... What I really love about reading these books is that Fitz' character feels so alive. Re-reading thes"
7062,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"Read as part of the r/fantasy Book Bingo Challenge 2018 for the ""Novel written under a pseudonym"" category. Hard Mode for this square required a book whose author has written under more than one pseudonym. To read a Robin Hobb book usually feels like cheating (especially as the point of bingo is to make you read well outside your comfort zone), but as I've been making my way through the Realm of the Elderlings books, I realised I could take this opportunity to include her work on my bingo card."
7063,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"Without any kind of surprise, it just gets better every time I read it. Some people say to new readers that they wish they also just discovered the books too to have that feeling again. I do not agree. With Hobb's books I feel like on every re-read it gets better, you see and understand many more things that had eluded you the first time. You are engrossed in the story but can still enjoy the writing style more. Fitz melancholy touched me even more this time. 100 out of 5 stars, would recommand."
7064,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"Regarding the entire Tawny Man trilogy: I found this second trilogy to be even better than the Farseer trilogy. This series is very character-driven, with Hobb digging deep into the characters and exploring betrayal, friendship, hate, love, sorrow, trust, and forgiveness. While the characters are older, they are not necessarily wiser, and are still beautifully flawed. The relationship between Fitz and the Fool is explored in a way that is at turns satisfying and heart-breaking. There aren't many"
7065,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"I couldn't put it down. This is the fifth Hobb novel I've read, and the first one I (almost) unreservedly loved. I still have some issues with some of her characterizations, and boy does she take forever to get to actual inciting events, but I'm ok with that, as long as the payoff is solid. The end of this one is very very good. I'll still thinking about it, and I think a longer review might become a blog post soon... We'll see."
7066,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"Hobb you wonderfully amazing and cruel author - you have once again broken my heart and made me enjoy the process! A really lovely introduction back to the world of Fitz, with a gentle way of reintroducing the character and making me remember everything I loved about the first trilogy. Quite a harrowing first book, with a lot of heartache and cruel scenes. However, this has spurred me into wondering why I leave it so long in between her books. Can't wait for the second."
7067,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"These characters, friendships, enemies, fights and more have me enthralled.. This picks up 15 yrs later with our tortured beloved FitzChilvary and his wolf, but no worries he's gonna tell you (or rather an old friend) exactly what he's been doing. And once again, duty calls, The Skills call, his Queen calls. Absolutely gut wrenching and captivating. Tears and laughter. Joy and defeat. Life and Death."
7068,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"Fitz is back and more morose than ever. Now a hermit, Fitz is called on once again to secretly save the six dutchies. I loved this book. It was better than the last Elderlings book, though Fitz is a little less likable. I'm excited to see where the Tawny Man sends Fitz next! P.S.-Ms. Hobb loves the word tawny."
7069,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"This was just the right length for the story and moved quicker than the last two books of the Fareer Trilogy. I hope the next two are like this. Since the Fool is my favorite, I loved seeing a lot more of him and found Dutiful's progression interesting. No one frustrated me in this, though as a cat lover I have to say ...the cats in this are creepy. Even Fennel. Especially Fennel. ;)"
7071,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"When you are a fan of series such as this one is hard to give a completely objective review. This book was a slow start and no doubt it needed to be that way, 15 years had been since our Fitz saw any action and a lot had to be said. This book is just an introduction of what is to come, it felt that way to me. That's why the 4 stars, but I'm sure the next one will be better."
7073,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,3,"This book was a bit slow, but normally the first book in her trilogies start fairly slow. I do like that each character really has his or her own personality and they don't deviate from it, even when it would benefit the character and speed up the story to do so."
7074,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"This book started off slow. I was a bit miffed that it wasn't delving right into the action. Then the second half of the book came and I couldn't put it down. By the end I was a sobbing, blubbering mess! I don't know if I have ever cried so much while reading a book!"
7076,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"This is my favourite of the FitzChivalry series so far. I cried multiple times. Robin Hobb has created a rich, beautiful, detailed world that has pulled me in and made me care deeply about this characters. That, to my mind, is a huge feat."
7077,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"Absolutely outstanding!! (view spoiler) [Absolutely heart wrenching, never loved a character the way I loved NightEyes, felt like an absolute sucker punch too... RIP Big Brother (hide spoiler) ]"
7079,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,3,"This book was a great introduction back to the world of the six duchies, and some of the characters from the Farseer trilogy, but I predicted the whole book from the summary."
7080,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"Quite good! I think I lost a bit by not having read the previous books, but things were explained enough that I had no trouble following the story and filling in the background."
7081,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"it is slow at start and it really takes a while before the story really is on its way, but once a the end, it was worth all the waiting."
7083,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"Was a bit slow in the middle, but great ending!"
7084,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,6th book read in 2016. Number 56 out of 499 on my all time book list. Review Pending:
7085,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"Fifteen years have passed since the end of the Red Ship War. FitzChivalry Farseer is believed dead, with only a few knowing the truth that he survived and helped end the war and the threat of the cruel King Regal. Living a comfortable life as a smallholder with his wolf Nighteyes and an adopted son, Hap, Fitz occasionally has strange dreams. He dismisses these, until his old friend the Fool visits with news: Prince Dutiful, the son of Queen Kettricken and the late King Verity, has vanished in a"
7086,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"I love Robin Hobb's writing! I put this book off for awhile because I was in such a book hangover after reading Liveship Traders. It's arguably my favorite fantasy book (after HP) and I had a difficult time moving on to her other books because I knew nothing would live up to that series. But, while I didn't end up loving this as much as Liveship, I'm extremely glad I finally picked it up because it still managed to be great. The novel started out fairly slow, taking its time to reintroduce Fitz an"
7088,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,3,"I approached this with trepidation, as I didn't enjoy Fitz at all as a character in his first series. But middle-aged Fitz is easier to get along with: softened a little around the edges, and his dilemmas about protecting home and family are ones I can relate to. As often with Robin Hobb's books, I felt this story had no need to be so long, but I was able to relax into the narrative and enjoy the details of the world of the Six Duchies and Fitz's physical and emotional journey."
7089,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,Another gem from Hobb. I love the web that she weaves through all her trilogies. Masterful and addictive.
7090,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"Ah, Fitz my friend. It was good to meet up with you again, but i'm going to part ways with you, just for a little while, because your misfortune is sometimes too much to bear."

7094,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"It was like visiting an old friend, one I hadn’t seen in a long time. I didn’t realize how much I missed Fitz’s narration until I started Fool’s Errand. I was immediately hooked and so happy to have returned to Fitz and his companion Nighteyes. .... Fool’s Errand picks up some years after the events in the Farseer trilogy and the Liveship Traders trilogy. Fitz is now 35 years old, goes by the name Tom Badgerlock, and has become a recluse with an aging Nighteyes at his side who’s not as nimble as h"
7095,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"I wonder how many times Hobb is planning to stab me in the fucking heart for the rest of the series. Worth it, though."
7098,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"Fool's Errand is the first book in the Tawny Man series or number seven in the Farseer series however you want to look at it. I would not recommend one start at this book because the character backgrounds are important to understanding the decisions they make. Fitz narrates this book and the story begins 15 years after the Farseer trilogy ends. He has lived a simple, secluded life with Nighteyes and a boy he raised named Hap. We don't know much about Hap other than Starling brings him to Fitz to"
7099,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"8/10 Returning once again to the adventures of Fitz Robin Hobb still manages to make an exciting start in this trilogy as her writing continues to be very good but, at the same time, also being beautifully captivating. Fifteen years has passed since the end of the first trilogy and Fitz has now grown up and lives alone, far from anyone that really knows him as he tries, in his personal exile, to find his own life in the world after all that he had to sacrifice for the salvation of the Six Duchies."
7100,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"Fool's Errand really connected with me, and I am really surprised how much I enjoyed it. There is one scene that is really moving and I felt myself tearing up, so I really can't rate a book less than 5 stars if that happens. FitzChivalry has reinvented himself as Tom Badgerlock. He lives in near isolation in the woods with his wolf, Nighteyes, and a young orphan, Hap, he has raised like a son. The only contact he has from his past is the minstrel, Starling. He occasionally Skill-dreams and sees h"
7101,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"A 4.5... In the long years since the events of the Farseer Trilogy, Fitz has been living a quiet life as Tom Badgerlock. Away from Buckkeep and all he loves save for the now elderly Nighteyes and Hap, a foundling he's taken in, and with no visitors save for the occasional tryst with Starling (who's become even more of a selfish, nasty bitch in the intervening years) he's become an old man before his time. A sort of peace has settled over the Six Duchies in the wake of the Red Ships War, but the l"
7102,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"Before I get into this review, I just want to point out that if you are reading this, and are interested in reading Robin Hobb (which you totally should be), I highly encourage you to read Hobb's previous trilogies (Farseer and Liveship Traders) before diving into this one. They are fantastic, and you will lose out on a lot of the enjoyment to be had in Tawny Man if you skip them. With that said, this was by far my favorite Hobb book yet. I went through an emotional wringer while reading it, and"
7104,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"4.5 stars. It's been a couple of years since I last read one of Robin Hobb's books, and re-immersing myself in Fitz' story has reminded me of just how much I love Hobb's work. First and foremost with Hobb's books is the writing. Every sentence flows beautifully, every word of dialogue feels real, and every page drags me deeper and deeper into the world she has created. Second is the characters. Fool's Errand sees the return of one of my favourite characters, The Fool, this time, wearing the guise o"
7105,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"For those who have waded through FitzChivalry's previous trilogy adventure (Assassin's Books), this is a brilliant return to cherished characters and wonderful opening to new storylines. For those who have never laid eye on the city of Buck Keep - never fear, you'll be pulled along for the ride. Summary (no plot spoilers): Hidden away in a small cabin with adopted son, Hap, Fitz is shaken out of self-imposed exile to serve his family, the Farseers. With his aging wolf companion by his side and old"
7106,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"You know you've found a good series when you can slip back into the world after a few months and have scarcely forgotten a thing. Fool's Errand (a title so true and simultaneously puntastic that I love it all the more) picks up many years after the end of Assassin's Quest , but despite the great leap in the timeline, everything I loved about the original series remains: sterling writing, excellent plots, and the characters that were and are the highlight of Hobb's world. I was sad not to see as ma"
7107,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"The story took its time to truly catch some wind under its wings. Not much happened for about the first 200 (!!!) pages. It was just Fitz being restless and wondering if he should take the task that was given to him, but after he made his decision, the story began to move forward fast. The text was enjoyable, the storyline interesting and I wasn’t even annoyed by Fitz anymore. The fifteen years of exile had, in my opinion, done Fitz much good: he was no longer the miserable whiner I had grown to"
7108,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"As per usual Robyn Hobb starts this series with a bang. I love that still, this deep into Fitz's life we're still learning and understanding not only the skill but the wit as well. Her understanding and perception on animals is relatable and at times beautiful. The humour in this this book is great. All character humour is believable and the way she perceives cats, especially Jinna's cat Fennel is hilarious! Jinna herself is an intriguing character, I immediately warmed to her despite Fitz's ini"
7109,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"Fitz's and the Fool's adventures continue in Fool's Errand, the first book of The Tawny Man Trilogy. The book is set fifteen years after Assassin's Quest. Fitz, now donning the identity of Tom Badgerlock, has become a recluse. After adventuring with Nighteyes for several years he has settled down in a remote region of Buck, adopted a foundling name Hap, and now spends his days tending to chickens and writing down the history of The Six Duchies. His quiet life is interrupted by Fool and the tendri"
7110,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"Robin Hobb at her best. I remember that when I first read it, I thought this book started slow and took a relatively long time to get into. But I didn't have that experience this time. Maybe because I just read the preceding two trilogies earlier this year. Entering the world of Fitz felt like slipping into a comfortable robe, or relaxing in a warm bath. I felt at home, and I could have read much more about his simple life at a small farm, with a foster son to take care of, and the visit of the"
7112,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"Spoilers for the Farseer trilogy in this review. If You haven't read that yet, don't read this review. Robin Hobb is probably the only author who manages to write a novel that can leave me thinking, ""That was fantastic! So well written! But not very much seemed to happen."" That is the beauty of her books. They are so driven by the characters' stories and the writing that the plot can be as slow as it wants, and the book will still be brilliant. Fool's Errand again follows the perspective of FitzCh"
7113,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"My heart hurts after reading this book. For fifteen years (or for me, two months) I have been without Fitz and his dear Fool. I wondered how different things would be. Would he be happy with his wolf Nighteyes? How did the appearance of a adoptive son be for him - a change for the good? Fortunately all those questions were answered... but unfortunately for Fitz, he had to return to the life he knew under a guise and watch it all fall apart at the seams. I marathon-ed this book in such a short am"
7114,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"As always, it was a pleasure to return to Fitz's world. This book takes place fifteen years after the end of the first trilogy, and it somehow perfectly achieved both a feeling of continuity (Fitz's narrative still feels like Fitz) and important character growth resulting from the passage of time. It was hard to put the book down, and I stayed up late to finish it even though I had to work the next day. This was an emotional book; I both laughed and cried ( (view spoiler) [I definitely cried when N"
7116,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"This is a multi-series combined review and is copied/pasted across all of Hobb's related series. It does not refer only to this trilogy, and includes Liveship, Rain Wilds, Farseer, Tawny Man, and Dragon Keeper series. These are the most compelling, most enjoyable, best-plotted, most complicated epic fantasy books I've read in ages. I adored them. There are 5 (?) interwoven, inter-dependent series that the author clearly outlined before picking up her pen for the first time. The characters are wo"
7118,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"I read this book back when it first came out 10? years ago and remember not liking it all that much. In fact, I remembered nothing about the next two books so either I did not read them or I made myself forget. This time, I liked this first book much better, but of course still not as much. The scope of the story is much smaller, and it takes a while to get going. I don't blame anyone for that because there's 15 years between Assassin's Quest and the beginning of this book, and because (understa"
7120,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"Ugh, I wasn't supposed to start the next (but continuing with the same characters) Robin Hobb series until a magical, never-gonna-happen time in the near future when I have no books to read. I just got 3 books from the library, have to read 2 books for bookclub, and there are other books chillin' on the other side of my bed just waiting to have their time with me. But no, I have to go find an audiobook of an addictive fantasy series that doesn't really even add anything to my life except ridicul"
7121,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"Apparently this book follows The Farseer Trilogy, so I lost a lot of background story from those previous books; nonetheless it was easy to follow the plot considering this is the first book of a different trilogy. This is the first time I’m introduced to a Robin Hobb book, and her writing is really impressive! Not to mention her visual imagination. It’s a very deep book, no doubt about it, and I’m not talking about its endless pages, but the intense story. The settings are so descriptive you fe"
7122,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,3,"Wordy. This book is wordy. It needed an editor badly. It could have been tightened up, as there were things there that didn't need to be. However, in terms of brining the reader back to the world they missed after the Farseer Trilogy, it was fantastic. All the old gang is back together, almost, and once again they must save the world. The plot was a little shaky, and you could tell that it wasn't given the same attention as the OVERALL plot of the series. It was a subplot. Those were handled bet"
7123,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"4 Stars but the first half really drags. Hobb does that to you, her writing is so good, she can keep you reading even though nothing is happening. And cats, hate cats, always did, always will, especially now! The Fool is a great character, amid many interesting ones. However, I am getting tired of the silly names for Farseer royalty, like Prince Dutiful. The kid is a major pain almost to the end. FitzChivalry is now Tom Badgerlock and does not come across as a warrior and assassin in retirement."
7124,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"This trilogy returns to the people populating Hobb's first Farseer trilogy 15 years later. And guess what? I still care about them a LOT and can't wait to see how everyone's doing! Book number 7 in this world and I continue to be riveted -- Hobb's storytelling really, really works for me. It wasn't until the end of the Liveships trilogy that I realized there is a character common to all the books, and that character (The Fool in the first trilogy, Amber in the second, and The Fool/Lord Golden in"
7125,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"im crying how could you do this to me -- this novel for me was excellent. it kept me interested on every page, whereas the original trilogy suffered from long monologues of exposition. the characters were extremely well crafted and the main mystery was very well done. i also really liked the foreshadowing, which was not so subtle but still really cool. fitz has become more likable to me as a character, as time has matured him and made him think about his actions [mostly], when in his youth he was b"
7126,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"I read Robin Hobb a long time ago in college, and then forgot all about it until my mother picked up The Tawny Man books and insisted I read them along with her. I had a bit of a rough time getting ""into"" this book. It may have had to do that it's the first book in a trilogy that acts as a sequel to the Farseeer Trilogy. However, it took a while to achieve any actual emotional resonance with the characters. The dialog seemed stilted, and the characters seemed a bit cliche and cardboard. However,"
7127,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"With the Liveship trilogy much fresher in my mind than the Farseer trilogy it took me a while to adjust to being back with Fitz. His narration is slower paced and his story continues to be full of pain so don't pick this up without some reserves of happiness to buoy yourself. Once I readjusted the action seemed to pick up and the mysteries became more intriguing. The Fool is incredibly entrancing and frustratingly mystifying as ever and I am left impatient for more, for while my library bought t"
7128,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"Great adventure back with Fitz! Really like the way Robin H does a trilogy, each book still feels like a standalone book, with a concluding story, yet fits into a larger overall arc. Book 7 in this world and nothing feels repeated, all ideas are well thought out, and many of the characters philosophical musings are well worth pondering and remembering. Back to this book, I liked the timeline jump and the new roles of characters, and the small interaction with Liveship trilogy was tidy. Still lot"

But they are good, so i’ve picked back up again with this. Clearly it presumes you remember what the eff happened in the last book, which I super don’t, so it took me a while to get back into it.(who the hell is Hob? What was Skilling about??) But then the book kind of takes a while to really get going as well, there’s little in the way of plot for a hundred pages or so"
7130,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"I love these books. While I can also appreciate the complexity of the multi-POV epics that seem to dominate these days, occasionally I still just want to be told a story , you know? A ""One POV, Witness the Narrative Unfold (through the eyes of the character it's happening to)""-type of affair. Great characters (Fitz and the Fool are two of my all-time favorites), and magic that's esoteric enough to not run the risk of drawing too much scrutiny to itself by the potential breaking of some sort of rul"
7131,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"More great writing from Hobb in the beginning book continuing from the Farseer trilogy! This first book of the Tawny Man trilogy picks up with Fitz and the collected remains of his life 15 years after the ending of the last Farseer book. Just as the first part of his life was filled with strife and the anguish I felt for him as a character, this book continues his life with similar emotional themes of loss, regret, pain, and reflection of the future and of self. Hobb's writing immerses you in hi"
7132,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"I love Fitz and the Fool from the Farseer trilogy, and guess what? this other trilogy is even more Fitz, and even more Fool! The book is great. Hobb is a master story teller, and the first person point of view makes it feel extremely personal. I have always felt that Fitz is a troubled character, and he seems to be always down on his luck, and having bad times. This book is no exception, and its an emotional narrative. At times i felt extremely sad and frustrated, which i guess is a praise on Hobb"
7133,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"It feels strangely good to be emotionally traumatized again. The first third was a bit slow, but once it gets going, it gets going . I can only imagine the next two are going to be really great, since they get to build off of this one. As an aside, if you're going through the Realms of the Elderlings series for the first time, I highly recommend you read the Liveship Traders trilogy first before jumping into this one (instead of going directly to this right after Assassin's Quest). It gives tons of"
7135,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"I don't reread many books, but a) knowing I loved these b) loaning the first trilogy to friends c) reading the beginning of the Fitz and the Fool trilogy, and d) finding my memory of the plot was fuzzy, this seemed a good candidate. I was pleasantly surprised to find I liked it as well as, if not better than, when I read it 10 years ago. Certain parts resonated with me a lot more than I think they can have the first time through. And I will no longer suggest these to friends with the usual ""well,"
7137,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"I liked this one alot. I felt that since the end of the Farseer trilogy, Fitz has grown and I really appreciated that he grew as a character throughout this book as well. Although typically Hobb's books tend to drag in the beginning, this one had the quickest pace of any so far (I skipped the Liveship and read the Fitz books 1-3 then this immediately following). Although many tragic things befall Fitz pretty consistently throughout his life, I'd say this book was the first time I actually shed a"

Her storytelling is masterful, the depth of her characters second to none that I have read. I cannot remember the last time a book brought me to tears, but I wept at the end of this one. This story arc spans twelve books, all between 600-1,000 pages long, and that prospect usually fills me with the dread of some chore; with Robin Hobb, it gives me comfort that I have such"
7140,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,I just love this book. I was a big fan of the Farseer trilogy and was excited to start the next series about fitz and the fool. book 1 of this series did not disappoint me. It was a little slow to get started but the action picked right up and I could not put it down. I love all the returning characters and even some of the new characters. Can't wait to read the other books. I'm sure this series will be just as great as the Farseer trilogy.
7141,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"I'd say this was my favourite Fitz story so far. Lacking the at-times tedious drag of the previous trilogy, this story flowed a lot better, and Fitz as a character was more enjoyable to read about. (view spoiler) [ Nighteyes' death certainly brought a tear to my eye - that was beautifully handled. (hide spoiler) ] Overall, a lovely book that references the Liveship series and even answers a few questions from those books too. Unsure where the rest of this trilogy will go, but looking forward to it!"
7142,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"Almost, but not quite 4 stars. (view spoiler) [Nighteyes' death (hide spoiler) ] broke my heart. The book retains many of the original trilogy's flaws, but also builds on its strengths. Maybe, I am accustomed by now to Hobb's writing. Maybe, I am too invested in the characters that I cannot rate the book objectively. Regardless, it took me less time to read this book than any in the first trilogy. And, now, I can't stop."
7143,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,"Unique magics abound in this fully fleshed world imagined by Robin Hobb, drawing the reader in and keeping him or her hooked. I cannot recommend this book and series enough. Any fantasy reader who likes intricate world building that unfolds in glorious layers will dive in and happily enjoy Hobb's creations. The characterization is amazing. There's never a moment where you doubt a character's actions, even if you disagree with them. Every detail matters. Remember them. You'll love it."
7144,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,"Just finished this ! I loved returning to this world and to Fitz and the Fool ! The the plot picks up at approximately 200 pages in, before that it's really slow at just exploring what the characters have been doing. Though I must say that the climax was well-done and not rushed as it always was in the Farseer books. I gave this book 3.5 stars. I like this book and plan on reading all 16 books from Robin Hobb! I love love love her characters !"
7145,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,"I won't lie, some small but undeniable part of me came to this book hoping to find fault. It would take a better man than me to watch Anthony Ryan's barnstorming success without a twinge of envy. Sadly I have to report that this is a very good book and deserves the five stars I've given it. Ryan writes well, he brings his world and characters to life with good description. It's as a story-teller he shines though, and a good story is always the keystone of a bestseller. Schools in fantasy books are"
7146,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,"When I first finished Patrick Rothfuss’ Name Of The Wind two years ago I was a bit sad. I knew that even though the book was wonderful (and had a sequel on the horizon), that great books which capture me as that one did don’t come along very often. Before Rothfuss was Harry Potter, and that was a good number of years before Rothfuss. It was five years before Potter that Pillars Of The Earth fell into my hands. So I’ve been working on an average of one Utterly Captivating Read every five years or"

They can be amazing, the book can be immensely enjoyable. This book is not one of them. There is a way to write a Gar"
7148,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,"A masterwork you don't want to miss; it is with temerity that I declare Blood Song as one of the best debut novels I've ever read. Why do I love this book? The simple answer would be because this is a book that has everything I love in epic fantasy and that it hit all the right notes for me. I could practically end my review with that answer but that wouldn't do justice to how great this book is. Now, it's time for me to take on the role of the Chronicler and inform you why it's essential for you"
7149,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,1,"Commas matter. They are important if someone, say, an author, wishes to convey a particular meaning or concept or image through the words they use in the books they want to sell. They are important for timing, and sentence structure, and plain ol' literacy. Plus, they make me feel good, like I'm reading something worth my time, rather than some 6th grade creative writing exercise. There's a big difference between ""Let's eat, Grandpa!"" and ""Let's eat Grandpa!"" Also this: ""His father didn't reply."
7150,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,If you like your fantasy Rothfuss or Sanderson-style this is a great book for you. It's a meaty epic fantasy with a really strong main character. I was sucked in and definitely want to read the next one!

7152,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,"Anthony Ryan is a new fantasy author destined to make his mark on the genre. His debut novel, Blood Song, certainly has it all: great coming of age tale, compelling character, and a fast-paced plot. If his first book is any indication of things to come, then all fantasy readers should rejoice as a new master storyteller has hit the scene. Update: I just received an ARC of Anthony's third book in this series. So I just finished a re-read of this."

A young protagonist apprentices himself to a magic military/faith monastery, and proceeds to become the greatest mage fighter the world has ever seen. But the general plot arc isn't the reason of this success. Everything else is. Anthony's debut is an addictive page-turner with compelling writing, interesting plots and sub-plots, masterful"

It includes an intriguing and powerful lead character who we follow from youth for at least a decade. The world is well-crafted"
7157,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,"Trilogy Review: I thoroughly enjoyed the Raven’s Shadow Trilogy, especially the first book, Blood Song. It was easily a 5 star read and one of the best fantasies I’ve read since Sanderson’s Stormlight Archives. It focused on one character – Vaelin, and his coming of age story. Taking place in a school (one of my favorite settings) it offered a combative learning environment that honestly reminded me of Harry Potter adventures meets the medieval, gritty reality of Game of Thrones. The camaraderie"

If done well (and it can be done badly ), it is one of the safest tropes in fantasy. It usually combines a coming of age story with the brothers-in- wands arms ambiance and a quest for saving the world . And indeed the Blood Song seeped into my veins with this heady mixture of ingredients like the best of drugs. I read it with an increasing exhilaration and overwhelming sensation of b"

It had everything one could want in a book. Action, mystery, romance, intrigue, and plenty of surprises. The world building was good, the plot complex, and the various characters were full of depth and personality. This was a thoroughly exciting and enjoyable read.

This is High Fantasy that is contemporary while still hitting a sweet spot for me with the mix of magic and battle. The story was engaging, the plot was well paced, the protagonist was flawed but likeable, the prose was polished. I can't believe this a debut novel.

7166,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,"4.5 Blood song by Anthony Ryan is a great new work of epic fantasy. It was released independently a few years ago and since then has built up a huge amount of buzz, made all the more impressive by it's lack of support. Because of this background I really wanted to like this book. Conveniently the complex characters and intriguing plot made liking it easy. Also the gratuitous violence. FTW.

There’s just something about school stories, be they wizarding schools or battle schools or even schools based in reality, that always just works for me. I’ve always loved learning, and I love learning vicariously through others, even if the subject matter has no practical application.

7168,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,"I had heard a lot of good things about this series but I felt that I went into it thinking it was going to be a three star at best I believe because it has been compared to Name of the Wind, a book that I enjoyed that was subsequently ruined by its sequel The Wise Man's Fear. Blood Song is told in a similar manner. The story is told from the perspective of the main character Vaelin Al Sorna after the events have occurred. He is telling his story to a scribe who has heard the stories of the Hopeki"
7169,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,3,"Almost everyone has high praise for this book, it's often cited as a favourite. It is also often compared to In the Name of the Wind, which I didn't like. I didn't particularly take to Blood Song although it seemed well written. I actually found it a bit slow and boring."
7170,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,"The whole book is 624 pages long but honestly it felt like 1000. I read for an hour and realized after that I just read merely 50 pages. I've read way longer books than this (The Stand, 1400+ pages) and that book felt just as long as this. It's honestly the format and style of the novel. The words are smaller than usual and the spacing makes it look like a can of sardines. Also there aren't much breaks between sentences so it's basically a whole page with one freakin' long paragraph. I hate frea"

I must say, given that I usually have at least 3 books on the go at any one time, it is very rare for me to completely ignore all else and just plough through one. I like being able to have a change whilst reading, but I have to say, once I was into Blood Song, that was it.

He does accents and inflections to really add something to the story. However, he's so DAMN QUIET. It seemed like he was whispering half the time.

7177,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,Simply the best indie book I have read. In the beginning of the book we are introduced to a character who is held captive by people despising him - he conquered their lands unprovoked and killed a well-liked heir to the Emperor. Fate brought a historian to him who became interested in how this person became Empire's enemy number 1. The book is the story of a child who would eventually grow up to lead an army to bring a war to a neutral nation. There are two reasons I did not give 5 stars to this

7184,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,3,3.5*'s. The thing I liked best about the book was how a lot of the things that seemed like small story details all came back to have larger meaning at the end and each having a purpose to the story. There are a lot of these tiny details that will definitely have defined meaning in the coming books.
7185,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,"Loved this. Found myself sneaking off to read more whenever possible, annoyed when life got in the way of my reading time. A serious page turner. Everything just clicked for me - plot, character, pace. Can't wait for the next one."

Anthony Ryan has created a near masterpiece to start out this epic story. This book will receive many comparisons with Patrick Rothfuss The Name of the Wind. Theft both are debuts from the author. Both are of the ""Epic Fantasy"" genre. They both center almost exclusively on a main protagonist that is clearly more than what we get to see. Heck, both of these books are very long"

I expected to be enthralled by a unique story that was hailed by many as equal to if not better than The Name of the Wind. In my opinion, it failed on both accounts. While I was not blown away by this story, I do see the draw for many readers and would not hesitate to recommend it."

If it's done right, it's a book heaven, if it's done wrong, it's horrid and near impossible not to notice for consistent readers.

I also liked the non-linear storytelling, and how different plots slowly connected and joined. It also radiated that nostalgic honesty you get in good literary works. However, the second half, or rather, the last quarter of the book felt a bit forced. I was under the impression that the author got tired, and then he started dropping heavy Scooby Doo cl"

I was hooked from the beginning, and I became more interested as the story progressed. I also really liked the main character. It has some common epic fantasy tropes. The main story starts off when our main character, Vaelin, is only ten. Shortly after his mother’s death, his father abandons him at the “Sixth Order”, where young boys are raised and taught everything about battle so they"
7213,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,"4.5 stars My people believe the raven to be a harbinger of change. When the raven's shadow sweeps across your heart your life will change, for good or ill, there is no way to know. Our word for raven is Beral and our word for shadow is Shak. And you, Vaelin Al Sorna, warrior in service to the Faith, are the Shadow of the Raven. Having heard so many great reviews, Blood Song was pretty much what I'd expected. The story of a young man who pledges his life in service of the Sixth Order, who over time"
7214,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,"Blood Song is a really, really good fantasy book. Nothing it does particularly reinvents the wheel, but everything it does do is just done so WELL. It was very enjoyable to listen to, particularly since the narrator had a wonderful storytelling voice. Vaelin Al Sorna was a young boy when his mother died, and his father the Battle Lord left him at the steps of the religious Sixth Order, a group of warrior monks who fight for the Faith. Feeling abandoned and angry, Vaelin embraces life as a Brother"
7215,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,"Very packed for a first book in a trilogy. Great pacing, cool characters and interesting twists. The main character, Vaelin, could take Logen Ninefingers a run for his money. Definitely liking his character's journey compared with Kvothe. He reminds me of Fitz, albeit a more warlike one. Plus the romance was not too irritating either (sigh of relief). The female characters are quite numerous being a military fantasy and acceptable enough. The worldbuilding with lots of religions and prosecutions"
7216,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,"OKAY wow this was such an amazing and fun and additive book! Everyone told me they loved it and I can definitely see why! The story follows Vaelin al Sorna who, at the age of ten, is left at the gates of the Sixth Order by his father. The Sixth Order are the elite soldiers of the faith and Vaelin endures harsh training for years. His story is amazing and I was hooked from the very beginning. I went into this expecting it to be entertaining, if a little generic, so I was surprised by how enjoyable"
7217,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,"This is a great debut novel, and definitely the best independently published (which it was originally) fantasy I've ever read. Update: I've just done a re-read of this novel in preparation for Tower Lord, and I was just as impressed with the book on a second reading. The characters are well developed and interesting, and I love the large scale of the story. I did notice that the novel almost seemed to be two separate novels in tone (one being Vaelin's time training in the order, the other being a"
7218,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,"Solid epic fantasy tale. Well written, with likeable and believable characters, sincere tone and intriguing and gripping story. There is attention to detail and unexpected subtlety at times and then surprisingly graphic violence at the others. It held my attention fully and made me feel for the characters. Recommended for anyone who likes epic fantasy, especially P.Rothfuss and B.Sanderson fans."

An ARC of Tower Lord (book 2) may be given to me (courtesy of the author) It is at this time I go WTF WTF WTF KYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA , and in exchange I shall do a video review of Blood Song, which is a fantastic deal.

7221,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,"I sit here trying to think of what I want to say about this book, what words can I use to convince whoever may read this that, yes, it is worth their time. All that keeps flashing through my head is... Believe the hype! There are countless reviews before and after this one that talk about how epic and great this story is. They all speak truth. So, believe the hype! Read this. its good. Its better than good...its...GOODEREST! One of the gooderest stories I have read this year! That's all I have to say."
7222,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,"4.5 Stars It is hard to believe that this is a debut novel. Anthony Ryan wrote this book like he’s been writing for thirty years. I immediately loved these characters, the plot—everything about it. The religion, politics and battles were so intricately woven with a fresh voice I couldn't put it down. There were quite a few twists I never saw coming and I never knew if a wolf, barbarian, or witch were lurking behind the next tree. Thank the Faith there's two more books!"
7223,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,- you know ... when a book becomes your standard for other books .. that every book you read you directly compares it to THE ONE -when a book make you fall in love with one POV and despise multiple POV - to make you like a name as ridiculous as Vaelin Al Sorna and shamelessly declare it as one of your Favorite People in fantasy this is fantasy at its finest
7224,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,3,"This is fantasy fiction. It started out as a solid 4 stars. I liked how the story of Vaelin started with his father dropping him off at the gate of the Sixth Order....I loved the dog too. Then it turned into another story, which then turned into another story. It felt like a story sandwich. Which isn't a bad thing, but this is one of those books that should actually be read on pages (or kindle) and NOT listened to on audio. The narrator had a pleasant enough voice, but the problem was that he ju"
7226,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,"This is one of those rare books that will bring to you such a vividly imagined world full of magic, political schemes, brewing with religious conflicts and preparing for a full scale war, a world in which every character is so full of life and death, hope and sadness, a world in dire need of a dark knight and finally a rich story told masterfully. It’s the story of Vaelin al Sorna, who has been trained to the life of a Warrior of the Faith in the Unified Realm “He had many names. Although yet to"
7227,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,"Fantasy Review Barn I don’t know enough about Anthony Ryan to accuse him of being Nickleback of fantasy lit, Blood Song (Raven's Shadow, #1)but he certainly seems to have crafted a book designed to sell. Nearly invincible protagonist humbly telling his story, long training sequence, love interest who holds her own. And in fantasy literature, taken as an escape, I fail to see anything wrong with this. New ground is not broken, deep thoughts are not explored, but a very entertaining story is told"
7228,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,2,"Once again I fell for the hype surrounding “Blood Song” by Anthony Ryan. A lot of trusted bloggers pitched this guy as the next best thing in fantasy, with many claiming it to be a “Darker Name of the Wind.” While it does have some cool moments, overall I was a bit underwhelmed. Blood Song is told from the viewpoint of Vaelin Al Sorna. The story opens with Vaelin being transported to face a trial by combat. On his way to this trial he tells his life story to a chronicler from a neighboring kingd"

This book had my heart pounding and my mind racing. I couldn't put it down. I think I read it twice I went back over so many passages. The ending caught me unguarded and that is a hard thing to do with me. I have read so many books that the ends are quite predictable but Anthony Ryan pulls"
7230,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,"I'm surprised more people haven't heard of this. It felt like Name of the Wind meets Game of Thrones, but ...better. Granted, the prose is nothing to write home about, but Blood Song manages to capture that Game of Thrones vibe while being less convoluted, and the Name of the Wind story structure but with a faster pace. And, of course, it offers a healthy dose of badassery too. I admit, the main character was a Gary Stu, the world wasn't that imaginative, but I loved it nonetheless; especially Va"
7231,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,3,"Blood Song is a fairly typical fantasy novel. You get our main character's entire life story, how he meets all his best mates, and how he becomes the epic warrior that is the crux of the action. We see his first introductions to the love interest (which of course is like 200 pages before anything happens again with them) and we see who will be the bad guy that forces our hero to pick up the mantle of battle. It's a good one, if not particularly surprising. There was very little in the way of ten"
7232,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,1,"DNFed @ 82% I don't care. I just don't even fucking care. I got to the climax of this fucking book where we find out where Vaelin got his names and let me tell you, it's so goddamn anticlimactic. And maybe that was the point in a ""Oh, it's war, you never know what's going to happen"" but after so many pages of Vaelin Gary-Stu-ing it up, I wanted SOMETHING where it all paid off. I wanted something where he godmoded to the nth degree. And that's my main problem with this book. Vaelin is the textbook"
7233,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,"First read: August 2014: This has been a very enjoyable read. A page turner for the greater part, full of interesting characters and events. I'm too ever whelmed to review it now. Full review later, perhaps. Reread: July. 2015: This time around I didn't enjoy it so much. I remembered the main plot points and without the excitement of the shocks, the book felt linear and I noticed it didn't have much humour - something I appreciate greatly in my reads. I'm still happy I did the reread in preparat"

7237,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,"5 stars! ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ An excellent debut novel. I was unsure how I would like this book until 1/2 way through. Then I found myself going back and re-reading the intro to stir the cobwebs in my mind. From that point on, I was enthralled. I loved it. The story is exceptional. The characters are amazing. The decisions heart wrenching. I see others have rated this low saying Vaelin Al Sorna is too perfect and women fall at his feet. From my perspective, that couldn’t be further from the truth. He is in"
7238,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,"Loved it. It’s not as flashy as, say, Brent Weeks, but this is an incredibly thoughtful, well-realized, steady, and thoroughly enjoyable epic fantasy. The protagonist is one of those rare “good” characters that manage to be utterly sympathetic, engaging, and heart-rending. Can’t wait for the sequel!"

While I recalled enjoying this the first time, it was much better the second time around. I believe this can be attributed to the following: (1) I wasn't suffering from a massive book hangover after Words of Radiance; and (2) My reading experience over the past couple of years has heightened my appreciation of character development.

7241,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,3,"Blood Song Reading this was like watching the entire Matrix trilogy. At first I was very excited and enjoying the ride, then I started to get a little lost as the main character becomes harder to like, odd powers were introduced and the story seemed to overwhelm itself and then finally I relaxed into the end game and just let it flow over me. The author himself quotes one of his characters when explaining the gist of the book. “We have fought battles that left more than a hundred corpses on the gr"
7242,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,3,Starts of very well & enjoyed the early years within the Order & how the group bonded & the yearly tests they face are detailed out which is great as you get an insight into their backgrounds plus the growing up is done quicker as you don’t follow them for the whole year. The feel isn’t of a YA read despite it being about thus aged which is all good too. I did however find it starting to flat-line around the middle part as the story wasn’t really going anywhere & the hero isn’t r
7243,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,"If you like Rothfuss or Sandersen you should know that Anthony Ryan has the same qualities and talents and therefor i highly recommend it to all of you! Blood Song, certainly has it all: great coming of age tale, compelling character, and a fast-paced plot.You can find here all of the action, tragedy, love, and depth you want in a great fantasy novel. It is a story of the main character growing and becoming a man of legend, it doesn't have the feeling of a repeating story told many times in the ge"
7244,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,"A coming of age story for adults who like there fantasy hero with a tempered edged. We know Kvothe (Name of the Wind) and Harry Potter, take away the magic school, replace it with a military order and you have Ryan's Blood Song. For everyone who has this on their ""to read"" list, grab a copy and read it, more likely than not, you will enjoy this great book."
7245,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,1,Nothing about it managed to keep my interest. It may just be because the story is a big flashback which lets the reader know the main character already made it through all these difficulties without any lasting harm done to him. Even the moments that should stir emotion just never stirred anything in me.

7248,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,3,"I have a fairly objective system for distinguishing the quality of a book relative to me: it is determined by the extent to which the book affects my thoughts. With a four-star book, I find myself thinking about the book frequently (while not reading) before and after I finish it. A five-star book, for instance The Idiot, the Name of the Wind, or The Silmarillion, will have me constantly thinking about it for days after finishing. A two-star book is more or less a book that I forget about the mo"
7249,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,"Some of the best fantasy series start with the protagonist at a young age, the advantage of this is you see the character develop mentally, physically and you get the sense of growing with the character. Examples that immediately spring to mind are the Prince of Thorns, A Dance of Cloaks, The Way of Shadows, The Painted Man and The Left Hand of God. The Blood Song is a high calibre debut, a self published novel that was available fairly cheaply on Kindle and potentially a big future for the author"
7251,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,"5* for the first part, 3* for the second. I stopped caring about Vaelin, that's what happened. If you want to know why, here's the reason... (view spoiler) [Things started going downhill for me with Vaelin's meeting with the king. Vaelin's deal wiped off all his mother's efforts to protect him. Maybe not the best comparison, but think of Harry Potter siding with Voldemort... If that would have been his only failing, I would have gotten past it. I know Vaelin was young, drunk and feeling guilty for"
7253,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,"The Good : Much like in Full Metal Jacket , the first half of this story is concerned with children in a martial institution, being honed into killers. It's a fascinating introduction to an excellent low fantasy setting, as is the framing device of the musing scholar. I find this kind of thing usually pulls me out of the story but in this case it is well done. The story is good, the ideas are good, and the ending has a very creepy little twist. The Bad : Sure there's a boss fight at the end, but this"
7254,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,3,"This book started out a bit slow, but got more interesting the further it went on. My take on it, is that it's basically the life story of the main character. I found it to be entertaining, but not a 4.5 star book by any stretch. Not sure what else to say about it without giving the story away, but there were a few things that detracted from my rating of the book: 1. It felt like that character was superman in a world with no kryptonite. He just seemed invincible, and like everything very easily"
7255,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,3,"3.5 * Really enjoyed this coming over age story told over 2 accounts, the past when he was a boy and the 2nd as an adult. Great school with tests and abilities having to be passed before proceeding. The action was fun, the characters well developed ( although not many females), but I did find alot of non relevant characters having large page time. I think that was my biggest issue with it. The multitude of short type of stories/events which at the time didnt seem like it had much to do with the s"
7256,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,"In one word: Like. In one sentence: Harry Potter on steroids. In one paragraph: There's a lot going on, considering there is really just one POV. The coming of age is done well but the constant crises Vaelin has to deal with are just too many for one book. I guess it was necessary, but could have been more elegant, in my opinion. The world building is phenomenal and most of the characters are plausible. I really liked the scene in the bakery. Grimdark gold! I will definitely read the next book in"

Vaelin Al Sorna, a scared young boy is abandoned by his Battle Lord father to join the Sixth Order of the Faith of the Unified Realm. The Sixth Order becomes his family, and he grows into a natural born leader and strategist, feared and respected throughout the realm. He is a most complex character, following his moral code, questioning all, despite manipulations and betrayals abounding. I heartily recommen"
7258,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,Most of this book was a 3 star read for me but the ending was an excellent twist and bumps it to 4 stars. If you had asked me halfway through if I was going to continue the series I would have said probably not but after that end I will definitely give the next one a shot.
7259,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,"I think that I first found this book from some reddit /r/fantasy book recommendations, and when I checked the Amazon page and saw the horrible cover, I almost didn't check it out. However, since the book had so many good reviews and it was only 3 dollars I bought it, but didn't read it for a couple months. Now however, I'm kind of sad that I didn't read it earlier and that I only paid 3 dollars for this beast of a book. After the introduction, the book immediately grabbed me and there were multi"

He goes through adventures and mysteries surrounding the kingdom and the hidden Seventh Order and the blood-song. This book is remarkably similar to Sherwood Smith's Inda series - but I would actually say it compares less favorably. The greatest weakness of this book is the dialogue. Most of the story is told in an limited third person, ce"

In a sense it was, but it wasn't dominated by the sheer gore of it. In fact it was an unusually honorable tale, but not to that extent where it becomes so unbelievably annoying.

Story starts with 10 year old Vaelin Al Sorna, son of Battle Lord of the Unified realm, left at the gate of Sixth Order by his father to train under the Order. Years of training and tests make Vaelin a famous warrior who is feared and respected by all. But as the story proceeds certain circums"
7264,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,"This book is outstanding. Ryan knows how to spin a story that doesn't let you go and he has wisely chosen to tell this story through the perspective of a wonderful protagonist. I don't often feel this attached to a character. Vaelin al Sorna is competent, thoughtful, intelligent, and not so easy to anticipate. Ryan only lets us so far into his head, revealing enough to invite compassion while holding more than enough back so that some of al Sorna's decisions surprise and intoxicate. I experience"
7265,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,"So I grumbled whiled updating as I went along, but very glad I read this book. Becomes more and more fun as you read, as layers are added upon layers to create some really interesting characters. Ryan take some risks, building slowly (very slowly at times), but in my opinion it all pays off. What I believed was going to be derivative and, honestly, a bit pedestrian for much of the first hundred or so pages, becomes the groundwork from which some new and rich characters and situations emerge in a"

7277,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,"Ryan has fleshed out an excellent Fantasy world. The only drawback is a bit of sluggishness. Barring that, a great read. I will be continuing with this series."
7279,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,"SIX. That's the number of Indie authors I've come across in the past ten years to whom I am willing to return. Anthony Ryan has joined that select company thanks to Blood Song, the first novel in his Raven's Shadow series. The Fantasy world he's created is intricate and deep. His characters come across as real people, especially the secondary ones. Admittedly, the MC is a bit too altruistic for my tastes. Most importantly, however, Ryan's storytelling is EXCELLENT and the story itself is an excit"
7280,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,Some parts were quite slow but overall it was pretty entertaining. I liked the characters more than the plot but the plot was still interesting. (Plus the animals in this story were awesome)
7281,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,"Anthony Ryan hit all the marks in this enjoyable first step into the Raven Shadow Trilogy. Boy turned into a warrior plot with a twist. If you liked joe Abercrombie's First Law series then this is a must read. The audio book is narrated by Steven Brand, who does a fabulous job."
7282,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,"Loved it:) although completely different then his Draconis Memoria books it still has a really cool vibe. Kinda nothing new that we havent seen alreadt but it Ryan puts a a little twist of his own on this type of coming of age story. Not much magic but that didnt really bother me this time. It is promising more on the magic stuff though. I hope at least. Anyway, 4 stars for this first book in the Ravens shadow trilogy:)"
7283,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,3,"This book had me thinking about ratings, expectations and hype. Yes I expected a lot more. The book was good, but the problem was, it stayed at that, it was good, it never crossed over to really good. I do want to read book 2 one day to see if it gets to that awesome territory, and to see what happens. But, no hurry. This book has one hell of a rating, and often when that's the case I think ok not for me, but yes I can see why others really enjoyed it. Now, I did enjoy the book, but I sure could"

I was a little 'uhh' before I started it but if worse came to worse I could just delete it from my Kindle and go 'well, it wasn't for me..' I was pleasantly surprised at how much I actually enjoyed it! Well, at least the first half of the book and then the rest sort of became 'ho-hum' and 'can this please end soon.' While my comments don't sound nice I could see why the book lasted as many pages as it did and my protest comes from not usually readi"
7285,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,2,"A traditional coming of age story embedded in a frame story with untrustworthy narrative voice. A bit of magic, humans only, shallow descriptions of different cultures, some very unbelievable bits of setting (e.g. half of the boys dying during education, really?), some wrong facts (e.g. sharp swords to cut through... plate mail?): This is not the greatest piece of world building that you've ever read, and it is missing the sense of wonder. Some might like the direct prose without lyric ambitions"
7286,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,This one is really hard for me to rate. It almost seems a sin to rate is less than 5 stars after reviewing other books that I haven given 4 to. Please make no mistake as this a GREAT story... a 5 star story. The only reason that I cannot give it that final nudge is due to several instances of confusion throughout the book. There are certain parts where I feel I had to read several times before giving up only to understand what I was reading several pages later. This book also appears to be laid
7287,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,3,"I found ""Blood Song"" to be a gripping coming-of-age tale with better-than-fair character and setting development. I enjoyed the single-point-of-view perspective and the pacing is good — except for a few places when the timeline changed suddenly and without warning, or the actions and attitudes of the players didn't seem to match their ages or time spent at the school. Also, while I didn't feel the protagonist, Vaelin Al Sorna, did anything *out* of character, the meat of his motives was sometime"

I found the writing, pacing, and story to be excellent, with a subtle but powerful magic woven throughout the story. In a number of ways, the story borrows from your typical ""boy becomes a hero of the realm"" pattern, but it constantly veers in directions I found fascinating. It's tempting to rave about this book for many, many pages, but I'll avoid the temptation and choose my highlights. First, I"
7290,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,"This was one hell of a story. With great characters and solid pacing, Brother Al Sorna's tale drew me in early emotionally and didn't really let go. Ryan presents a different take on 'coming of age' (at a hard-ass combat school with significant trials), and also different from a fantasy genre perspective in that those within the school of the order and the faith are opposed to magic. I particularly enjoyed the bond formed between Vaelin and his brothers and the strong sense of loyalty prevalent"
7292,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,"I was swept away by this book. The main character Vaelin was truly a Virtus theme. So were others in the cast. It is a gritty world, very medieval in feeling, but I found the setting mysterious and well crafted. There is great humor as well as drama and you care about the band of brothers from the Sixth Order--kind of a Hogwarts for assassins. The strong language was a turn off for me, my only real complaint. It's not as dark as GRRM and had some very intricate subplots. Loved all the twists and"
7293,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,3,"This is the first time I have felt the need to use a half star in a rating. 3.5 stars. I'm having such mixed feelings about this book. It had quite a few five star parts, but a lot of stuff that didn't make sense. It started out a two star book, and scaled up to a four star book by the last few chapters, so 3.5 stars. Pros: • Author was very tasteful. There was unsavory stuff occurring, but the author didn't feel the need to describe it graphically, which I appreciated. • I liked having a strong mo"
7294,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,2,"I know I am in the minority here, but I did not particularly enjoy this book. It wasn't terrible, I certainly do not hate it, but I was definitely looking forward to just being done with it (since I just can't stop reading a book I started). The story did not intrigue me at all. That being said, there definitely is depth to the story, hints of more going on beneath the surface, but unfortunately the overall arc was just so bland I really don't give a crap about uncovering those secrets. The charact"
7299,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,"*I listened to the audiobook* I enjoyed the book, the story, and the characters once I got into the book. A little of a slowish start the story builds up through the training and character building to a good ending. Of particular note; the variation in narrator / PoV. I really liked the limited view of the 1st person narration of the historian and the conflict in truths between the story being told to him, and the one we hear. It was cleverly done."
7300,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,3,"I wish I would have liked it better...the writing was there, the characterization was there..... The magic system was there....But god it just plodded along. And the MC? Gary Stu. I had the same problem with Name of the Wind, so maybe first person chronological stories just aren't for me??? I don't know."
7301,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,"Wow. That was a pretty great book. Perfectly balanced it seems, just the right amount of everything. At a certain point I was afraid it would be too much war and fighting, but it wasn't. Quite a world that has been built here, I'm eager to read the next book!"
7302,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,"Strong Character Arc. Told in the now familiar (The Name of the Wind) , ""story within a story"". The Book overall has excellent pacing, and pulls the reader all the way to the end."
7303,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,3,"This took me a while to get into, quite possibly because it was such a genre change that i had to get used to the style. But by halfway i was enjoying it. I thought it was well written and i really enjoyed getting to know Vaelin and the other characters through him."
7304,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,"By far one of the best epic fantasy novels I have ever read. With complex characters and an engaging, this story tops everything I've ever read."

7311,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,Excellent book. Moves to the top of my favorites list.
7312,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,"I have much to say about this book, but I'm currently without words. So much happened, but it didn't feel rushed or forced. The story comes together naturally and beautifully."
7313,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,"This book was the most amazing human interest story. It could have been set almost anywhere that government and faith were put together, like Spain, or the Caliphate, or even Rome, but Ryan chose to create his own world to showcase his all too human story and minimize the fantastic bits. It could have been purely historical fiction, instead it's epic fantasy. Altogether what it is, is groundbreaking! THE PLOT: Now this is the part that is going to sound like every other fantasy, but stop right t"
7314,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,3,"I am going to be honest; I was a little bit disappointed in this. As for some positive things, there are no love triangles (barely any romance in general), a very detailed origin story and an easy readability. On the other side, there was little character development, unnecessarily made up words and a weird time jumps and overall set up. The book starts off okay. I was not too invested in 10-year-old Vaelin but that's on me. But the plot barely picks up from there, we are told in detail how their l"

7319,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,"I had once again began to lose hope in the indie publishing field, having been disappointed with the last few indie books I’ve read. A few of them started with great promise, but left me quite disappointed in the end. But all hope was not lost, at least not since stumbling across Raven’s Shadow by Anthony Ryan. I haven’t been this excited about an indie book since Progeny by Ryan Kaelin ( http://www.rtkaelin.com ). What is it with Ryans writing exceptional stories? Anyway …on with the review. The"

The writing is superb, easy to read and makes you fly through this huge book, especially the first 500 pages really sucked me in and made me not want to put the book down. And while i didn't love the main character, Vaelin, he was defiantly an interesting character to follow along, from the start where he is left by his father to be trained by -lets just call it what th"
7321,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,"Original Review: July 2013 Edited for Update: Sept 2016 ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. First of all, there is a reason why Anthony Ryan's ""Blood Song"" has a 4.4+ rating! That rating alone speaks for itself. Secondly, WHY DON'T MORE PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THIS BOOK??? This is a needle in the haystack kind of book, a dark horse, the most underrated book I have read EVER. It's so damn hard to find an amazing book. The last time I read an amazing book (and when I mean ""book"" I'm talking about a REAL BOOK, not the over"
7322,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,1,"Stop me if you've heard this before: A young boy watches his mother die and is sent off to an order of warriors to be trained wherein him and a small band of friends have many adventures, most of which revolve around our main character somehow constantly being in the right place at the right time and simultaneously incredibly competent at exactly what he needs to be competent in! But wait you say, Luke gets his hand cut off and has to be rescued by his friends from Cloud City! Right you are, exce"
7323,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,"I’ve read two really good new fantasy books this year. The first was Prince of Thorns and the second I’m happy to say is Blood Song. “Blood Song” was self-published independently and was listed in the Amazon kindle section at a nice discount. Usually, I stay away from these as most are quite literally, trash. However, what intrigued me about this one was that there was over 150, 4 and 5 star review/ratings. 150 is a lot more than the usual 5 reviews a self-published author can drum up via friend"
7324,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,"“There are books full of great writing that don't have very good stories. Read sometimes for the story... don't be like the book-snobs who won't do that. Read sometimes for the words--the language. Don't be like the play-it-safers who won't do that. But when you find a book that has both a good story and good words, treasure that book.” ― Stephen King This is one of those instances where you need to read for the story, and a damn fine story it is.

7325,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,3,"Clearly I should have gone to a school where I would have been trained as an unstoppable killing machine. There should have been vicious political currents of dire importance to the world and also a fair chance that my classmates might not even survive the learning process, though of course I would always have succeeded where they failed. If that had actually been my life I might not feel so compelled to read about it, but since it wasn't I remain a sucker for that kind of fantasy setting. This i"
7327,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,"A good friend recommended this book to me, but I couldn't find it. I did find a later book, The Waking Fire, and so I read that instead. I've already reviewed that book, but let me just say that I really, really liked the Waking Fire and so happily returned to the shelves to snag Blood Song hoping to go backwards in time. It was not to be. Instead of a world of alchemy and industrial age technology fueled on dragon's blood, we find ourselves in a brutal world of Northmen and empires. This is a swo"
7328,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,3,"I enjoyed reading this book but it didn’t blow my socks off. The plot follows a typical fantasy vein: the development and training of a young man into a great warrior through a set of tests and challenges accompanied by a number of loyal companions. I liked the religious aspect in the book, the different orders and the mystery surrounding a secretive seventh one; while it is not an original concept I think Ryan did a good job in describing the different skills and goals. The “blood song” gift is"
7329,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,3,"Anthony Ryan's Blood Song was on my list for a long time. Finally managed to read it. Story :- The books introduces us to 'The Hope Killer' a man shackled in chains as he tells his version of the story to a Historian who accompanies him to his last battle. The story is quite interesting as we see his years at the Sixth Order, an elite group training boys at the art of war from a young age. There were a few twists at the end but most of the story was pretty straight forward. Characters :- Most of t"
7330,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,"In the tradition of GRRM’s Ice and Fire series and Joe Abercrombie’s The First Law, Blood Song by Anthony Ryan is a hard-edged “low fantasy” novel loaded with political conspiracy, complex inter-relationships and lots of sword play. The hero, Vaelin Al Sorna, is a classic morally conflicted protagonist, seeking to do the right thing in the face of the complex moral dilemmas he faces. But despite breaking no new ground, this book just worked for me. The characters were deep and well crafted. The p"
7331,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,"Another new Author embracing the Grim Dark Style of Fantasy, which insists on scratching my itch, just right. This Series (This book anyway - so far) does what I thought the Paul Hoffman stuff (Left hand of God, etc) was going to do - Take a child at a very young age and create perfect (religious) warriors - and this series does it very well indeed! It's riddled with cool characters, violence, clever narrative and has just enough world politics in it to make it interesting, but not so much to dra"
7332,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,"I didn't read this book because the summary looked like I would enjoy it (it didn't sound interesting to me) but because of the many good reviews and the listing in ""Best fantasy under the radar"" and ""Best indie fantasy"". I wanted to be surprised and I was - in a good way! I got really attached to the characters, I enjoyed the setting and found the story-telling intriguing. I was surprised by some story twists and less so by others. A few scenes I found rather confusing ""If only he had known if"
7333,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,"Man i did myself a disservice by listening to this one on audio. The narrator wasn't exactly bad, but there wasn't enough variance in his voice. There's a lot of characters, and a lot happening, and a lot of breaks that move the story between times and places. The narrator made it confusing at times as to which character was speaking or where the breaks were. The story therefore felt like it was jumping around a lot and I had to do a lot of rewinding to keep up. As for the book itself, I found it"
7334,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,"This. Book. Ruined. My. Weekend. Read it when it was first released, just bought the hardcover and read it again. I was hooked from the first page. I sat down and read for days, didn't answer my phone, stopped checking work emails, I went MIA. Vaelin Al Sorna has to be one of my favorite characters I have ever read. The character depth in this book is phenomenal - everyone is so well thought out...I loved the time skips as well - no filler content. No pointless pages. Everything in it was there f"
7336,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,"I liked this one a lot. Yes, it's generic, but that made it a fun, easy read...And there was enough mystery to make me excited to keep reading. I did feel like the middle had a serious dip in pacing. The academy section was awesome - and I wish we spent the whole book there - and the denouement was absolutely exhilarating. Unfortunately I've heard enough about the sequals to know not to try them. I'm going to check out Anthony Ryan's new series instead! Also - I really loved the voice actor for t"
7338,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,"I really, REALLY wish I could give this a 4.5 or a 9/10. Such a great read! Some parts seemed a bit slow, but when the pace picks up it really picks up! I really liked how we grew up with Vaelin and Anthony was able to make it interesting. Usually I get bored with books where you go through the hero's training as a kid, but he made it work really well. Really happy with this book"
7339,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,Incredible... A haunting tale that is both beautifully composed and magical in every way. Blood Song reminded me of books from my youth... A more traditional vein of fantasy... Single POV... Coming of Age story... And mysterious magic. It was like catching up with an old friend. A truly impressive debut. 5/5 stars.
7343,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,Review to come.
7345,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,"A really great book, highly recommended.a must read for all fantasy fans. A really good twistat the end. Cant wait for the others."
7348,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,5/5 Review: Once I started reading this book I can count on two hands how many times I put it down for a break. Each time it was with a deep sigh of regret that I couldn't continue reading due to some pesky obligation like work or sleep. This book took a hold of my attention and I read it like my life depended on it. Any book that can have that effect on me gets 5 stars without a second thought. Vaelin Al Sorna is a prisoner. He's spent the last 5 years in dungeons. He is hated by everyone around h
7349,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,"The main reasons, why I picked this book up, were the high Goodreads rating and the many comparisons of it being quite similar to Patrick Rothfuss’ Name of the Wind. They're both epic fantasy coming-of-age stories with overly talented, yet hard-working main characters, but I find that the broad similarities end there, but it really has been a while since I read Name Of The Wind, so I might be mistaken. This is one of the books, that does the circular plot pattern quite well. Only in the last few"
7350,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,"How to rate a book worthy of the hype but is far from perfect? A story, that as a whole, is better than the sum of its parts ? That even after days of completing it, is not faded into white noise? It defies personal logic why a book I would objectively rate 3 stars is whimsically promoted to 4.25 stars just because storytelling-wise, Blood Song * simply killed it. Relentlessly plot-driven, the story breaks no ground insofar as epic fantasies go. Recently bereft, 10-year old Vaelin Al Sorna is adop"
7351,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"I literally don't remember when I read my first Tamora Pierce book. All I can tell you is that it was Alanna: The First Adventure and it was probably an audiobook that my parents checked out for one of our infinite family road trips. I can't have been much older than, say, third grade at a stretch. After that first one, needless to say, I was addicted. (Yes, I read Lioness Rampant in elementary school. It was... educational. Then again, I was already into Pern by then, so...) I also don't remembe"
7352,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"I hopped into this book hoping I would not be confused out of my mind. I have heard of her Tamora Pierce's other Tortall books, especially the enormously popular ones about Alanna, but the premise of those books didn't interest me. I hate to admit it, and this is terrible backwards of me, but books about cross-dressing, disguised characters do not interest me. This applies to manga as well; don't even get me started on how much I hated HanaKimi. This series about a young girl with animal magic s"
7353,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"I loved this story when I was younger, and I’m so glad that it hadn’t lost its magic at all, even if I’m a bit older now! I loved Daine in this book and how strong she was! She fought so hard to protect people, and her animal friends, even if she was a bit stubborn at times. I also liked the storyline, even if I have read this multiple times before, I remembered everything that happened but it didn’t spoil the story for me at all! I loved the travelling, the training, the dragon and other magical"
7354,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"Oh, these books are so lovely. These are like fairy tales for intelligent, empowered girls. The problems are black and white, the villains have simple motives, and the little girls are the heroes . I love every minute. And I will snatch these up for my daughters and say thank you very much. These books are like middle grade or even elementary age fiction that’s been labeled YA, because they have mature relationships. And by mature relationships I mean young women choosing to be intimate with partn"
7355,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,"Well, that was outside my wheelhouse... So in my life outside of Goodreads, aside from the usual adulting that we grown-ups do, I run an actual Sci-Fi/Fantasy book club. Well, we started out as a book club, and then expanded to also watching movies, drinking wine, and generally hanging out and geeking out together about anything science fiction and fantasy related. Anyways, we tend to pick our books by popular vote, and Tamora Pierce was one of the authors whose name was being bandied around freq"
7356,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"After a short break, I've returned to Tortall, and guys, it's great to be back. I decided to resume my long-overdue Tamora Pierce education for two reasons: first, the Immortals quartet was completely new to me (as a kid, I had a passing familiarity with the Alanna, Kel, and Aly series, having read a few chapters of each before abandoning them); and also I found out that my sister has all four of the books in one volume, so I stole it from her. Sorry, borrowed . The first book takes place about te"
7357,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"I wish this book would have been around when I was about 11, I know it would have been one of my favorites. As it is, I wish I knew a 11-13 year old girl who loves to read so I could buy this for her. If anyone knows of one and will let me adopt her for about 15-20 minutes tops, let me know! :) One thing I like to do with books is going into them completely blind with little to no idea what it is about. Tabula rasa style. I often don’t even read the back of the book. Some of the time this “tabula"

I have heard so many good things about this book and Tamora Pierce 's books in general come highly recommended by some of my Goodreads friends. But I fear that if I haven't found anything that makes me want to go on up until now, I probably won't find it in the next 150 pages either. Please don't understand this as a discouragement to give Pierce's books a try - this is in no way a bad book, it's just not f"
7359,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"Wild Magic literally changed my life. It was the first series I read with a strong girl as the protagonist (I read this before her Alanna series), and I wanted nothing more than to leave my horrible junior high behind and drop into Daine's shoes--even with all the bad stuff that happens to her. I mean, the girl can talk to animals! This is an older book, so while it might have been YA when I was younger, it would definitely qualify if as MG these days. Don't let that scare you--there's still SO m"
7360,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,IT WAS REALLY AWESOME IF ONLY THE TRANSLATOR DIDN'T MESS IT UP. I admit this was a long reading. The translation in Indonesian is a mess. It should be a delightful reading. The story was awesome. I never know how much I miss epic fantasy until I read this and get this fulfilment feeling.
7361,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"This is the first instalment in The Immortals series. This managed to combine all of my favourite fictional elements - a complex magic system, political intrigue, a sprawling fantastical world, villains you can truly hate, an abundance of animals and the most lovable of friendship groups that had me yearning to become of them - and did all of this whilst also creating a unique and consistently exciting story-line. This may only be my first Tamora Pierce book, but it definitely not be the last!"
7362,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"If you have read my other reviews, you will know that I am a huge Tamora Pierce fan, (though I am now perhaps a little older than her target demographic). However, despite this I am not blinded to the faults in her writing, something which I discovered in the disappointing recent release ""Melting Stones""So trust me, The fact that I've given this book 5 stars is because I believe it to be truly deserving of each and every one of them. I grew up on a diet of richly rendered fantasy books, which inc"

My review is still honest. Believe it or not, this was my first Tamora Pierce novel! Because of this, I didn't realise until I'd started that I should have read the Alanna quartet first, but I still got the gist of the story and I don't think it impacted my enjoyment/understanding too much. Wild Magic follows Daine, a young girl with a secret, tragic past"
7364,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"I think this is my 5th or 6th reread? Yeah. Still a favorite, the book that launched my love of Tamora Pierce. Some of the appeal of this is lost now that I'm an adult and no longer identify so deeply with Daine, but it was still great! This book, and this series, was so hugely influential in my reading life... and I suppose in my life, period, too!"
7365,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,2,"Two stars, but that's not to say I didn't read this in one sitting, because I did. (Then again, it's not very long.) In order of least to most frustrating: 1. The note that ""Like her predator friends, Daine ate meat"" is pretty interesting. Definitely important to note and also - slightly weird? The later distinction that she can't eat anything she shifts to is even more important, because it tries to resolve the inherent contradiction between seeing these animals as friends and, you know, eating"

7367,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,I don't know! This was never as special as Alanna to me and it still feels a bit THERE. It all seems to come somewhat easy for Daine. No idea what's going on with the plot. I do like all the updates on the Alanna characters. And I like Daine! (Why couldn't Daine have more friends her age??? The few that are there are SO minor.)
7368,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,4.5 Stars Video Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2wUH...
7369,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,2,"After raiders destroy her happy village, a young peasant girl named Daine joins up with the Queen's Own hostler. They travel to Tortall, having dangerous adventures along the way. Once in Tortall, Daine discovers she has Wild Magic, which enables her to communicate and control all animals. Despite the many attacks by monsters, this book lacks any narrative tension, probably because I actively dislike Daine."
7370,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"After having been so immersed in the Full Cast Audio Circle of Magic world, Tortall almost came as a bit of a shock. A few familiar voices in different roles made for an odd (but not unpleasant) experience. Once I'd gotten used to Daine again though, I remembered how much I had always loved this series too. These productions are amazing, I don't know what I'll do when I get through them all!"
7371,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"I know, I know. Review in haste, repent in leisure. But I just finished this book and I want to share it with everyone I love. It's my favorite animal-communication fantasy I've ever read. There are three more books in the series, so I don't know yet what to say about the whole -- it may get even better, or it may lose the wonder that characterizes Daine's younger years and the beginning of her journey, as told here. I'll let you know. But this book can be read alone, and it's overwhelmingly spe"
7372,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,1,"I have greatly enjoyed many of Tamora Pierce's books, this was not one of those. I had trouble from the beginning, there are many little things I could point out, but things really started to get bad near the end. The story revolves around Daine, a thirteen year old girl who can talk to and influence animals. Having just suffered an incredibly traumatic series of events she leaves her village and finds work with the manager of the queens rider's horses/ponies. Stuff happens and to cut a long sto"
7373,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"This was, in many ways, a book that stole my readers virginity. I picked this up in the school library when I was eleven years old, ten years ago. The cover, matching the one I now own, was a spider with a mans head, and in no way appealed to me. But the first chapter, titled 'A girl with a pony' drew me in immediately. Thank God for my horse obsession, or I'd never have discovered these books, and this wonderful author. It was my first fantasy book. It was my first book not directly related to ho"

This is one of those books that's forever lost to you if you don't first read it before age 14.

I did read the Song of the Lioness series first, but I don't think you'd really have to in order to understand and enjoy this one, though that series is definitely good background reading for this one, and introduces several of the characters and concepts that show up here. It's the main characters in THIS series, Daine and Numair, that I really"
7380,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"Well, this stood up to my memory of it. I still prefer it to Alanna, I think. I just do. Something in Daine speaks to me more, or maybe I'm just a sucker for stories about people finding a home. I enjoy Daine's relationship with the animals. I laughed at her crush on Jonathan. Onua is as awesome as I remember. I had forgotten how Numair is introduced in this. I forgot he could shape-shift. I giggled when I remembered. And the Stormwings are still suitably terrifying/creepy. I do enjoy Numair and D"
7381,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"I discovered Tamora Pierce as an adult who still likes to read YA coming-of-age stories. While not as complex as the more recently written books about Beka Cooper, the quartet of books about Daine, which starts with Wild Magic, still satisfies. My reread was prompted by my younger son who after devouring the Erin Hunter Warriors series and the Kathryn Lasky Guardian's of Gahoole Juvenile Series, started to read Wild Magic. He was thrilled to have Mom reading the same book he was! So Wild Magic has"
7382,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"I read this aaaaages ago but we just reread it for roommate reading time. Jasmine and I were SUPER stoked to introduce Andre to the world of Tamora Pierce. ""I dreamed I was a badger and woke up covered in bats! Also, we're being attacked."" ""... can I hold one?!"" We had a great deal of fun making up a running commentary as we read.

However, when she rescues a hawk from Stormwings, a type of immortal, she discovers she has a type of magic which could affect all of Tortall. This is one of my favourite fantasy series, as I love how absorbing the story is and how brilliant the characters are. I wi"
7384,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"Calling all Guardian Herd fans--I think you'll enjoy Wild Magic by Tamora Pierce! The focus of this series is on animals and horses, so what is not to like? We follow our main character, Daine, on a wild and magical adventure after she's hired to help move some aggressive and unruly ponies south. The setting is medieval-ish, the writing is to the point, in a good way. The action is exciting! Odd beasts abound and most are not friendly. And there is a dragon. So yeah, read it."
7385,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"I had a long car-ride with my younger son over the winter holidays and was looking for something for us to listen to while I drove. I'd liked how the Full-Cast Audio recordings had worked for the stories that Tamora Pierce had written to be released on audiobook first, so jumped at the chance to reread Wild Magic. Using a different actor for each character works wonderfully during Wild Magic and I highly recommend the audiobook experience."

I say that because - knowing myself and knowing the tropes that turn me into a quivering mass of hyper-obsessed jelly - I'm fully aware that this book would have utterly consumed me. Possibly in a very unhealthy way, though I've no doubt it would have been a simultaneous blast. ✔ An unpretentious, empathetic, and resourceful heroine finding family after facing loss"

7389,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"4.25 / 5 One again, Tamora Pierce's writing is brilliant, and never ceases to amaze. After finishing the first quartet in the Tortallan universe (Song of the Lioness), I was curious (and a little concerned) as to how the universe would be expanded upon in this sequel series, but I needn't have worried! The new main character Daine was really brilliant and I loved how different she was from Alanna whilst still being a strong female character (with a LOT of backbone ;D). Her relationship with all t"
7390,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"Wild Magic begins the second quartet featuring the land of Tortall. Although there are some familiar names in this novel - cameos from the Alanna quartet, such as Alanna herself, Jonathan and Thayet, George - a newcomer to the Tortall world could start here with absolutely no problems. The level of reading is eight plus, I'd say. There are occasional moments of violence, as you'd expect from events in a feudal country that is beginning to descend into war, but nothing that I'd be worried about a"

7393,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"I loved this series as a kid, and it's still good. It's of its time - the character of Sarge is a bit uncomfortable, for example, and some of the gender politics are very dated (don't flirt with the thirteen year old girl, twenty year old guy - it's not cool) - but on the whole it's an ace kid's book, surprisingly dark, full of adventure. It's better paced and plotted than the Lioness quartet, possibly because Pierce wasn't trying to cram in a lot of world building (and her writing had frankly j"
7394,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"I wasn't sure if I'd like this new series as much as the Alanna series but after the first few pages I did!!! Daine is a very different character but equally wonderful and I love Numair's flirty sarcasm. The animals reminded me of Redwall even though it's not quite the same but I liked all of them and seeing Daine interact. But let's be real, the best part? SEEING OLD BELOVED CHARACTERS EEEEEEEEEE. Every time one of them popped on the page (no spoilers from me) I fell more in love. I love seeing"
7395,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"Gosh I loved this. I have no clue why I waited so long to continue the Tortall saga. I probably would have read it faster if I realized all my Alanna faves popped up here and there in this series as well. Sure, much of the plot could be taken care of with communication but I don't care! I love Daine. I love charming mages. I love wild magic. AND NAUGHTY PONIES! I might love those most of all."
7396,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"Read at least (10) times Soooo this was the first book I ever read by Tamora Pierce. It was great. Incredibly great. I read it over and over and over again. I remember reading the new books in the series as they came out and they were sooooo good. Then I read Alanna, then I remember being enraged when Sandry's book came out and it was in a different universe, but I fell in love with those ones as much as I loved these ones. Tamora Pierce is awesome!!! Just sayin'~~~~~"

I don’t even have the heart to write a decent review, and believe me when I say I’m hurting inside---this was my first Tamora Pierce book and I had such high expectations, but the poor darlings came all tumbling down as the story progressed. I just couldn’t get into it. It’s… it’s all over the place, to the point that I had no idea whatsoever of what, who, when, where… I just---I just---it’s not for me.

7400,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,"I liked most parts of this book but I really found it a little difficult to get into it. I liked Daine and Uona (I prob spelled that wrong). I would've liked for Daine to have been a little more mature but I guess since these series is a long one it makes sense that she is really young. I liked that she was able to communicate with the animals and that she was able to have them do what they needed, they also alerted them when they were in danger or danger was approaching. I was surprised when Nu"
7401,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,I loved this book.All of the twist were really good like the castle being attacked while some of the warriors are drawn away.I also loved how when you thought you knew daine's secret something comes up and you suddenly feel as if daine was different

7404,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,"Even though I loved being in the Tortall world and seeing Numair and Alanna, I really didn't love Daines narration. The story was bogged down by the endless meditation scenes. I do plan on finishing the whole series this month because I never actually read it all the way through but after this first book that doesn't actually shock me."
7405,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"A good book. Even though it is directed at a younger audience, I rather enjoyed it and will definitely finish this series. :) I loved meeting all of the old Alanna characters; they're great. Animal magic is my kind of thing."
7407,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,"Hmmm. You know what? Wild magic should be up my alley. A girl who can talk with animals and isn't quite human herself. The animal speech is awesome! From hilarious, cute, to a little scary. The book moves swiftly! The cameos were awesome. It was too wonderful seeing my favorite characters again. Especially to seem them as happy couples. Oh, and their kids. So cute. So why didn't it hit as hard as the The Song of the Lioness series? Simple. Daine. Alanna walked a perilous path. Between her magic"

7410,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"I've never understood why Tamora Pierce's work is marketed primarily as 'Children's Books', as her legions of fans show clearly that her work surpasses such silly restrictions. If you haven't encountered her before, I'm envious - there's so much out there now to enjoy. But I'm not surprised, as these books go in and out of print in the UK with no rhyme or reason, and in an effort to categorise, they've often been lost in library and bookshop shelves. I first encountered the land of Tortall when t"

Unlike the series I've reread MANY times, like Song of the Lioness and Protector of the Small, I haven't worn out this series with rereads and already-set opinions. It's been long enough since the first time that it's almost like reading it for the first time again, albeit while knowing some key spoilers. I'd definitely forgotten how much I like Daine. Probably because my dislike of the main romance of the series has colored my view of all four books, even the ones it"
7412,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"I absolutely loved this book. It contains so many of my favorite themes. First, we have a hard-working and gifted female protagonist with a backstory that pulls at the heartstrings. She's smart, compassionate, and a dead shot with a bow and arrow. She has a unique connection to animals that is magical and humanizes her quite a bit. There is a large supporting cast of interesting and diverse characters who are likable and have clearly defined personalities. The only character that isn't clearly d"
7413,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"After I finished the 'Song of the Lioness Quartet' the first time, I was anxious to read more about Tortall. At first I couldn't stop thinking 'But it isn't Alanna' for all of about a few pages before I was in love with Daine's story. She is someone who you can really relate to. She has such a sad background story that I won’t spoil but she is someone who you honestly feel with and her abilities only enhance the way that you grow to love her character. She is someone who has been through hard ti"
7414,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"Looking for a feel-good fiction piece that doesn't suck? Snatch it up. It's classic fantasy in many ways and has some of the silliness of the genre: made up names, a manufactured religion, all the magic creatures of history in one place together etc. But it's fun and not astounding but solid and happy and warm. I love that although she makes up a religion she doesn't spend pages wading through explaining it, it just is and we discover some bits of it organically and still wonder about a lot of i"

I never bothered because I'm through my fantasy fiction stage and have heard Tamora Pierce described a feminist author. I've found that ""feminist author"" seems to translate to pointless sex scenes. However, Joe doesn't like that kind of thing and liked this one. Also, I was stuck at home due to an injury, my TV crapped out so I couldn't watch movies, and once the drugs kept me from any heavy reading so I decided to giv"
7417,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"Wild Magic was the first book I ever read by fantasy teen writer Tamora Pierce, and continues to be my favourite. It may help slightly if you have read Pierce's previous Song of the Lioness quartet, but certainly not necessary — I didn't get round to reading it until several years later. Wild Magic is the first book of The Immortals quartet, and in my opinion, the best series of stories that Pierce has to offer, placing her immensely likeable heroine Daine amidst a backdrop of magical upheaval,"
7418,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,"This was a quick, easy read, but there's really nothing special or outstanding about it. I think it kind of sets up the character of Daine, but it seemed like it moved from one thing to another, introducing new ideas a little too quickly. I didn't like it quite as well as the Alanna series. Daine is a likable enough character, and there are some returning characters from the Alanna series. There are also a few new ones as well, but no one that grabbed me, and although I liked the end of this stor"

I didn't love Daine at first, but she became a lot more interesting to me once she started exploring her powers more. I loved the the inclusion of some characters from the Song of the Lioness Quartet. Catching up with Alanna and having the chance to see her as not only a Knight or the King's Champion, but also as a mother and wife was wonderful. I really wish that I'd read all of Tamora Pierce's Tortall seri"
7420,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"Rereading some old favorites. A couple things stuck out to me the most this time around: 1) The abuse rhetoric. Even though the context is different (ie not sexual assault or domestic abuse), Tamora Pierce straight-up wrote out how decisions bad people make are NEVER the fault of the victim, no matter what they say or try to lay blame. Not sure I caught this as a pre-teen, but I'm so glad it's in there! 2) The age gap. Numair is what, 29 in this? Having now reached and passed that age, I am even"
7421,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,This is my first read of Tamora Pierce's writing and it didn't let me down. I like the flow of the story though it was not very action-packed within 3/4s of the book but I enjoyed it all the same. I was curious enough of the protagonist's past and secrets that led me to read on. It was easy to follow even if the instructions were for drawing the wild magic and mastering it. The characters were all interesting. I really wanted to read the Lioness Quartet and was surprised to see Alanna in this bo
7422,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"Aw, I liked this book a lot. I think Pierce's writing has improved somewhat over the early Alanna books. Not that it was bad before, but this is just delightful. The magic, especially, was great in this book. I loved getting to talk to the different kinds of animals and see how they think. Whales are hardcore pacifists, apparently.

7423,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"Beautiful, enchanting, magical, wonderful and endearing. I have finally found a book to call it mine. Yes, I have read fair amout of young adult books that I really enjoyed and loved but nothing has touched me so close to my heart than this book. I knew I would like it before I read it, considering it was about a girl with power to convince, heal and converse with animals. As a little girl, I'd dream of such 'power'. There is no super hero(heroine) in this world I'd rather be! I savored every pa"
7424,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,"The Immortals series, of which this is the first, follows the adventures of Daine, a girl who discovers that she has powerful animal magic - she can speak to animals, command them, and even shape-shift, eventually. I liked the characters and the nicely cohesive overarching plot, carried out through all four books, and I appreciated the thought given to the ethics of animal magic, of being able to control them for human purposes. By the end, though, Daine and her cohorts are almost too powerful,"
7425,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,"This book was full of fantasy - maybe even a little too much for my liking! Sometimes the whole part about the Immortals and all the crazy creatures made the plot a bit confusing. In the end though, everything came together and all the loose ends were tied up. I really liked how this book gave me an outsider's (Daine's) view on Tortall, Jon, Alanna, Thayet etc. contrary to the previous quartet which was from Alanna's view. I think that Daine is such an interesting character and I can't wait to r"
7426,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,"Really a 3.5 - I very much enjoyed this book and thought it was a fun and creative YA novel. The Full Cast Audio edition was great to listen to. Personally, I would have enjoyed more in the way of plot - this was a very character driven book. While the characters were great, I felt more plot was needed to balance the book. Further, many questions were left unanswered in this novel. However, this is a series and the weaknesses I saw may resolve as the series continues."
7427,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"While I like Diane, I'll never love her the way I do Alanna and Kel. I don't know why, and it's not really fair, but her story never grasped me the same way. But that doesn't mean I don't still enjoy this quartet, and especially the first book is great fun. Hearing her reactions to meeting the characters we know and love from Song of the Lioness is always interesting."
7428,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"There's nothing I can say that will adequately express how I feel about these books and I'm not even going to try. Besides, the fact that I read them all repeatedly (I quit counting after the 10th time) is the highest form of praise I can give anyway. Daine, Numair, and the others are friends as dear to me as any in this world."
7429,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,Absolutely lovely novel. I love the characters and all the imagery in it. I can’t wait to continue on in this series. Incidentally this was one of the first books I read by Pierce and I remembered absolutely nothing about it

I’ve been aware of her since my preteens. I know she’s a big deal in the fantasy genre. But because she’s a big deal, I always felt that she would be unaccessible.

But there's more to Daine's ""knack"" than meets the eye: she can actually talk to animals. Her unusual skill set brings her into contact with the highest levels of Tortall society. The kingdom's fate may rest on her ability to master her talents and communicate with her animal friends. I was a huge fan of The Song of the Lioness Quartet as a child, but"
7438,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,Do you remember that time when you read a book and it made your heart sing? That’s what Wild Magic did to me. I felt so wonderfully absorbed whilst reading it and all I wanted to know was what was going to happen next. I’ll start with a caveat– Wild Magic is not a Young Adult (YA) book anymore. It was written when YA was slightly differently classified than how it is today. I would classify it as Middle Grade (MG) as there’s a lot of innocence in it and it’s that coming-of-age story that grabbed

Well the actual writing of the story could be better as I found it really lacked coherence. I started reading this book in 2002 and I know this because it had a ticket stub from the butterfly conservatory in Niagara Falls as a bookmark. I don't think I made it much past the first chapter back in 2002 as per the location of the ticket"
7440,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"Originally posted at Chain Interaction Don’t get me wrong, Alanna was a phenomenal protagonist, but something about Daine just clicked with me, maybe it was her connection with animals, maybe it was her fear of her own madness, I don’t know. Suffice it to say that I fell hard for Daine. I loved her, I want to read fifty books from her perspective and I couldn’t wait to keep reading more. This book captured all of the things I love about books with animals and just kept running with them, I ador"
7441,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"This was such an amazing story! I listened to this on audio and it has effects an a full cast, it was pretty amazing. This was my first foray into Ms Pierce's book and I was a little afraid that because this book is so old it won't have aged well, but I was wrong it didn't disappoint at all! Daine, our main character, was 13 and she actually felt 13, she didn't feel like an adult talking, you could hear the immaturity of her age in her words and I loved her for that. She is empathetic and strong bu"
7442,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"A friend and I were discussing books that we had read during our childhood, and she brought up Tamora Pierce. She was shocked to learn I had never read the author, and immediately gave me her favorite book to read. Thus, I began Wild Magic. Pierce’s writing style is quite simple. There are many minor repetitions (a character grinned four times in the space of two paragraphs), and, frankly, her descriptions can be rushed. Saying that, her plot writing is charming and magical. I found myself intrig"
7443,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"While of course Alanna is always close to my heart as the first TPierce (and really, YA fantasy text) I ever read (at age 8 or 9), Wild Magic shows such a development in writing skill and world building. I think maybe its because Alanna is kind of fast-paced -- the first book ranges over like 5 (?) years, as do the others... whereas in Wild Magic, the text covers only a few months. I love the slow paced development of Daine - from her fear of her magic to developing skills. I love her uncertaint"
7444,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"This has to be my absolute favourite series by Tamora Pierce. I was a little scared for the re-read, because I was a bit worried that it wouldn't hold up to my memories, but I am happy that wasn't the case. Daine has always been very close to animals. Despite not having 'the Gift', there seems to be something magical about the way that she can communicate with them. When Daine has to flee her home, she is offered a job working with horses that changes her life. Now she's on the road to Tortall wi"
7445,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"This book is perfect. I can't believe I haven't read it before! Why aren't stories told like this anymore??? It's clear to see from this novel why Tamora Pierce is a Queen in children's and YA literature. This novel contained fully-formed characters who were kind and loving, intense and emotional conflicts, and a myriad cast full of differing ages, races, and genders. I frankly went into this book expecting the unrealistic rendering of childhood I felt in Alanna's story, but while Daine perhaps"
7446,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"This book about a 13 year old girl, is an engaging book for the girl that likes fantasy and adventure. And it will hook the boys too! I enjoyed reading this a second time. I especially as a teacher enjoyed the hook in the epilogue that will catch the kids and get them to read another book! If you are looking for a coming of age, I'm not sure of myself, fantasy, adventure book this is it. Many kids will identify with Daine as she goes about learning about herself and the world. It will also give"
7447,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"Tamora Pierce will always and forever be one of my childhood favorites. While I was originally more partially to the Circle Universe books, I believe I have officially found I love these also. Daine is an expressive character finding herself while she harnesses a magic seldom seen in humans. Her journey is full of emotion, adventure, and wonderful friends. Numair, Alanna and George are especially lovely, though I've also experienced them in her other Trickster books. Wonderful experience where t"
7448,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"Tamora Pierce’s writing is so understated; the stories are simple and yet you feel so connected to the characters. I loved Daine’s character, I would have been so jealous of her as a teen- talking to animals! How cool. As always, women rule in the land of Tortall, and I loved seeing the king’s champion knight Alanna again, especially running off to fight ogres while her husband stays home with their children. ❤ Can’t waif to continue the series."
7449,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"I do love this book. I love the magic and the world, the strong female characters and the unconventional royalty. I also love the immortals and the unnaturalness of them. Daine does happen to have some extraordinary luck in terms of her own abilities and her choice of friends but I'm willing to let that slide because when I first read this as a 13 year old it was exactly what I wished my world would morph into and I can't forget that."
7450,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"I am pleasantly surprised by this first in a quartet of books about Daine and her wild magic. I expected a lot to do with horses, and that happened in the early part. But after the arrival at the capital - and then some - all kinds of things happened. No romance, although I suspect that may happen as Daine gets older. By the end of the book I am certain that Daine is a lot more than a horse whisperer! The only reason it is not 5 stars is - well - kind of a cliff-hanger ending. Enjoyable read!"
7451,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,"I always passed on this series because I don't go crazy over stories about mages or people who can speak with animals. But as always with Tamora Pierce, the characters drew me in. An interesting perspective for me, having read about Numair's history in Tempests and Slaughter before this. Authentic, character-driven, spare language, and seems leisurely-paced until you reach the end and discover you have whiplash."
7452,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,I really enjoyed this book I liked the world and the characters and the power of the main character because I’m all for animal talking and how she evolved and grow up in this book and how we learn about her past and how she slowly grew more comfortable around other human and she’s smart and brave And even if it was a bit slow at times I liked it a lot and I can’t wait to read more about this world
7453,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"Wild Magic is a fantastic story, it’s full of adventure and surprises! Diane learning to control her magic is fascinating, and the animals she speaks with have such personality!!! I love reading about Alanna after she grew up, and in between the older books, it’s fun to hear her from other peoples perspective! I highly recommend this book to people who enjoy adventure, animals, and a bit of wild magic..."
7454,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"Pretty good book, but not as good as the first book of the lioness series. It's good to see Alanna again, and all her children. Didn't really peg her as a mother, so it will be interesting to see how she progresses over time with more character development. I like the new character Daine a lot as well, a complete personality change from who Alanna was as a child. Can't wait to see her adventures."
7455,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"I first read this series when I was in high school and it is what got me started on reading fantasy. Rereading it not, I was happy that I still really enjoyed it, definitely a step on in Pierce's writing too as the book feels more fleshed out and not as eager to speed through time as The Song Of the Lioness quartet. Very much looking forward to the next one :-)"
7456,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"This was one of my favourite series as a kid. I re-read it several times, if I remember correctly. Just love any fantasy that involves communicating with animals! Plus there were some great characters. One day I'd love to re-read all these books from my childhood."
7457,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,I wish I could talk to animals!!!
7458,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"I could read this series over and over and over again. Oh wait, I have."
7459,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,A start of another great series by Tamora Pierce! I love that she added in so many mystical creatures in this one!
7460,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,"Fast paced and engaging, though a little bit simplistic."
7462,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,I've probably reread this almost as often as the entire Song of the Lioness series and it is still frelling fantastic. But I'm particularly biased where the Lioness is concerned.
7463,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,More brown people! 🎉 Some of them main characters! 🎉 Mostly not weirdly othered or saved by white feminism! 👍
7464,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,Love Numair and Daine! This series is Going to be a wild ride!
7466,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,"A fun read for kids! I can see why this was my co-workers favorite as a child (go figure, she's now a veterinarian!)."
7467,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,Finally back in this world again! After how many years? 6? 7? Too long that's for sure. I loved seeing Alanna and the old cast of characters again. I've missed them a lot. I loved seeing them interact with Daine and Numair. Can't wait to continue reading this quartet.
7468,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,forgot how much I liked Daine as a character and how interesting wild magic was. the plot is a little episodic and weak but you can’t have everything.
7469,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"It's so nice to be back in the world of Tortall. I'll be honest, I was not Daine's biggest fan but she grew on me. This adventure was less interesting but I feel it was building up toward something more. It was fantastic to see Alanna, George, Jon, and their children. I am looking forward to how this story develops and delving into it further."
7470,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"I loved this book so much as a kid that my copy is literally falling apart — what higher praise can I give it? It’s still a really satisfying read as an adult (although I think Wolf Speaker may be, on the balance, my favorite Daine book), and I look forward to sharing it with the next generation someday."
7471,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,"This would have been my favorite book if I'd have read it as a young teen. They're short, the language is plain and all the animals are the friends of the protagonist, Daine. Overall, very few original ideas, she has special powers and doesn't know her dad and surprise, he turns out to be a big deal (later in the series). There also isn't really any conflict in the story other than ""let's defeat the bad guys"" and occasional teen moodiness from Daine."
7472,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"I read this on audio book. The main character, Dane, was created with a past so the story moves you into her future. The entertaining quality of the book holds the readers attention. It is an excellent fantasy adventure. Even the animals have feelings, ideas, and friendships. It's a series book so you can look forward to reading more about these characters."
7473,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"4/5 stars The Immortals Series has been one of my absolute favorites since I’ve started reading fantasy novels. It was the series that actually got me hooked on fantasy as a genre. I first read it in middle school and for the first time, 12 years later, I started to reread it. I remember loving it, but 12 years is a long time and whole different life stage. Mainly, I bought the series because a new edition with the amazing cover pictured above was released and I had to have it. I remembered the g"
7474,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"*****FINAL RATING: 4.55 STARS***** CATCHALL It must first be said that my review of this book and the following three books of the series are not in any way first impressions. I have read these books several times over the years, and only write a review now as I was asked to review these books to celebrate the newest release of the novels. I must admit that I still found this book every bit as magical as I did the very first time I read it. THE HEROINE VERALIDAINE SARRASRI Daine is an incredibly"
7475,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"I hadn't read this book since I was perhaps 12 or 13, but for my nostalgia month I dug it out from the back of the bookshelf since, I felt, it did have a distinct place in my mind and in my book history. I bought it one summer while my family was vacationing in Oklahoma. With it I bought two other books which I feel definitely had huge impacts on my interests and reading for years. Although, Wild Magic really wasn't a part of that transformation I did like the book and read the entire series whe"
7476,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"Because I needed to become invested in another amazing series. Needed to. I mean, I couldn't really pass up more Tamora Pierce, could I? And I pretty much consider this series part of the whole Tamora Pierce world, so it's not new-new. Right? WHAT WAS WRITTEN Daine is thirteen years old and, for as long as she can remember, she's had a special connection with animals. It's not, however, until she is forced to leave her family home that she realizes it's more than a connection - it's magic. Taking on"
7477,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"Wild Magic follows the Song of the Lioness series and is the beginning of Daine’s story, a 13-year-old girl from Galla, a country to the north of Tortall, who was orphaned shortly before the story begins. When Daine meets Onua, horsemistress of the Queen’s Riders of Tortall, at a fair and secures work as Onua’s assistant, she’s unaware that her life will greatly change. Daine has a strong connection with mammalian animals. She’s able to communicate with them and even influence them in other ways."
7478,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"I loved this book. It pulled me in by letting me find everything out right along with the main character, who also had a lot of secrets and a scary past that she was hiding. Those came out gradually. Very compelling. Of course the next thing I did was go to the library and check out every other Tamora Pierce book on the shelf, only to find that a lot of the others are nowhere near as good. I thought at first it was that phenomenon where you think the first book you read by a particular author is"
7479,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,Re-read on 4/2/13. It is just as good as it was the first time I read it. This is probably my 3rd re-read. I have to wait a couple of years to read this series again and again because I remember it so well. This is my fav series of TP's. Daine is my fav character too. Re-read 4th time 3/27/18. I still adore this book and series. So happy. =0) When I was a junior or senior in H.S. my Eng teacher took our class on a trip to our library. That was my first time at the schools library.The librarian too
7480,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"Wouldn't it be fun if you could talk to animals? What would you say? What would they say? Better yet, what if you could become an animal? How would it feel if you had the body of a hawk, but you still had your mind? That would be cool. You'd have the keen eyesight of the bird and the ability to fly. What if you could be a wolf? You'd have such a strong sense of smell. What instincts would you feel pulling on you? What would it feel like? I have loved animals my whole life and I feel a strong conn"
7481,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"When My friend told me about this book I was a bit skeptical. Though I usually trust my friend's judgement on other matters, books are usually off limits. Now I will read books when my friends really want me to, like The Green Glass Sea when one of my friends was literally trying to force us to read it, even threatening to read it allowed to us. I suppose I shouldn't say I don't like to read books my friends tell me to read, I just don't trust them when they start telling my that I will love a bo"
7482,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"I loved this book yet again! I always feel for poor Daine, losing her mother at such a young age. Her fear that she went mad and that it might return! I love the premise that she can communicate with animals. I always wanted that power! I look forward to the next book! Update: August 21st, 2016 I never realized before or at least noticed that Daine was so 'country'. She was very surprised and confused by how backwards and relaxed the royalty and nobles were in Tortall. At least she was able to swi"
7483,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"Since I was a little girl I've had a ridiculous love for all little furry, feathery or scaly beasties. I won't deny that it borders on ridiculous as I've spent copious amounts of time chatting to the neighbourhood cats, rescuing baby squirrels and damaged pigeons, adopting my own cats and generally fussing over every animal I come across. Needless to say, my husband is an endlessly patient man, which isn't surprising since my eldest cat Topaz personally picked him for me. (You think I'm kidding"
7484,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,"This is one of those books that Susie lent to me when we did our “books we read when we were in middle school or thereabouts” swap. This series takes place a few years after the end of the Alanna series I reviewed last time. The heroine this time around is Daine, thirteen-years-old, orphaned, homeless, and oh: she can communicate with animals. She can mind-speak with them, and therefore she understands much more about “the People” (as they refer to themselves) than your average human. This is Dai"
7485,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"I happened across this book when I could not find the second book in the Protector of the Small series at my school library. I noticed that it was from the same author and decided that I would give it a try. This book is very much different from Protector of the Small, though it is set i the same world and appears to be the prequel series to that one now that I look back at it. The main character is Veralidaine Sarrasri or Diane for short. She starts off as being an assistant horse caretaker for"
7486,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"This is the book. I love how the author gets to stretch her wings here and show us some more of the scope of the incredible land she's imagined for us. The countries she hinted at in Alanna are not just names, suggestions on a map, they exist! They have legends, religions, histories and cultures.No artificial depth here! Alanna is extremely special to me and a large part of who I am (I just named a horse that looks like Moonlight after her :D) but I think Daine and her wild magic have my heart i"
7487,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"The previous books in the series all took me a couple days at least. Wild Magic I read in less than 24 hours. Why? Because it's the best thing ever put to paper ever ever ever. Seriously! So, first of all, I absolutely adore that this is a whole new book in a whole new series, with a new protagonist, new magic, and many new characters. It's a new coming-of-age story, too, with its own themes, very different from those of Song of the Lioness. Yet, it was also sort of a continuation of the previous"

Young Daine was looking for work handling horses when she came apron Onua, horse mistress of the Queen's Riders in Tortall. She hires Daine, but is wary, for Daine is lying to her in some way.

7489,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"What I liked: -Daine. She was a little younger than me, but she was intelligent, caring, and she had a unique bond with animals. I loved her powers and the bond she shared with Cloud. -Secondary cast. One thing I like about Tamora Pierce is she includes her previous characters in her new series. Alanna has always been a favorite of mine, and she made an appearance in this book as well. George was also in this book, and he was always a favorite too, and it was nice to see how he and Alanna’s life w"

She meets up with Onua, the horsemistress for the Queen's Riders. She is hired on because of her way with animals and they start the trek back to Tortall with a herd of ponies. Along the way they see some of the monsters that have begun invading the lands. Daine also saves shape-shifting mage Numair when he is hurt and poisoned.

7491,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"Wild Magic by Tamora Pierce is a magical journey that gives new understanding to what it means to be magical. In this series Daine, the protagonist, is a young girl that has rejoined civilization after losing her family to raiders and bandits. The story starts out by describing how she got a job working for a housemistress that needs a assistance. Daine is skeptical about opening up to her about her past and is scared of how it would effect there growing friendship. As their journey rages on t"
7492,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"I just re-read this and I love it more now then I have ever loved it (if that is even possible). Book 1 of a 4 book series. Daine is 13 and an orphan. Her mother, grandda, and ll her animal friends were both killed by bandits except for Cloud, her horse who was with her on an errand for her mother. None of the townspeople who her mother helped came to check on them. She was all alone and took up with a pack of wolves to track down the bandits and get revenge. But what you need to understand about"
7493,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,2,"2.5 stars. I was interested in reading the book due to the fact that the main girl, Daine, had a power of communicating with animals. This was the most interesting feature of the story, though not enough to keep me interested, unfortunately. For the plot and structure of the book seemed very disjointed. I had trouble understanding what was happening at certain points and the motivations for what was occurring. There was a lot of traveling throughout the book and so I guess it seemed unsettled to"
7494,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"Ok, so I just got home from visiting my family in Utah. While I was there I finished the book I brought so I visited my adolescent book shelf (still filled with all my books) and pulled out one of my favorite series: Tamora Pierce's Alanna series. I loved it all over again. The girl who trades places with her twin brother to become the first woman warrior in centuries. You know, woman power and fantasy at its best. Anyway, I finished that series and found out that this is the second in a set of"
7495,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"In this first volume of a series, Pierce returns to the world and characters she introduced in her Song of the Lioness fantasy epic. Here, she tells the story of Daine, a 13-year-old orphaned girl with an extraordinary talent for communicating with animals. The teenager is swept up in the first skirmishes of a war, and is forced to master her fears and learn how to marshall her magical abilities. Trying to make the sequel to four previous novels stand on its own is no mean feat, and Pierce has a"
7496,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"It took me way too long to read this book, but it's not really the book's fault -- I kept getting waylaid by book club books, 20-year-old comics, and books for school. With that said, this is a nice continuation of the SONG OF THE LIONESS series. It opens up the magical elements, adds several new characters, and catches us up with several of the key players from the first series. (I'm 99% sure you could enjoy it without reading the earlier books, but that's hard for me to say since, y'know, I've"
7497,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,"Not bad, really. Considerably better than some of her more recent novels, such as the Trickster series. A fairly classic tale in the ""poor, young, misunderstood child discovers she's really incredibly special / talented and finds a new family substitute along the way"" vein: Mercedes Lackey and Anne McCaffery are also famous for them. Frankly, they don't have to be all that good as long as the world is reasonably interesting and the characters basic enough that we can imagine ourselves as one of"
7498,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,"In the first book in this series, Daine, a 13 year old girl is capable of communicating with animals. Although this sounds interesting, the way the author handled it was more annoying than anything else. Daine is an orphan, who is trying to develop her skills while a war is going on. In her journeys, she becomes an apprentice to a mage, who helps her develop her magical skills. Using her skills, Daine senses new beings known as immortals trying to break into her world. Her and her friends now mu"

Thayet and Jon have their own kids and are in the story as well... I love the character Daine. I was definitly a little worried in the beginning with a new character and new story but I love Daine as much as I love Alanna. Daine has wild magic where she can talk to, heal and even control animals. She has so much spirit like Alanna did. In this first book"
7500,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"I love love love this series. In some ways, I may even like “The Immortals” series better than “Song of the Lioness” although that’d be an extremely difficult decision. The thing that’s so appealing about Daine is that she’s not noble, she’s just a normal girl that has been thrown into some very odd circumstances. She’s feisty, overwhelmed, learning a lot and not afraid to protect her own. It’d be unrealistic for all the characters in the Tortall realm to be intense fighters. One of the best thi"
7501,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"Oh I'm so glad I'm rereading this series. This was THE FIRST Tortall book I read; I practically had it memorized by the end of middle school, and I admit trepidation as to whether it'd hold up to reading as an adult. But it DOES hold up, beautifully. Daine remains a wonderful perspective character, Numair is a ridiculous stork mage, and I'd forgotten how much I adore Onua and Cloud. Having just finished rereading the Song of the Lioness, I found the development of Pierce's writing style even more"
7502,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed this tale of Daine, the animal-whisperer and her adventures in Tortall. Daine is a mage but doesn't know it yet. Numair, the King's mage, knows it and is training her to wield her ""wild magic"". Daine is the hero who saves the day when invaders attack her new home. She draws all the animals - land and sea - to fight. The invaders consist of ""immortals"" which are fantasy creatures (griffins, ogres, dragons and human/animal hybrids) that were once sealed in another kingdom but"
7503,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"I really liked this book and Tamora Pierce is as awesome as ever, but Daine was just a bit lacking in a way that I can only describe as being Not Alanna. Daine is a great person who I like, respect, and enjoy, but sometimes I get a bit resentful - she is amazing at archery and can talk to animals and stuff which is cool, but she didn't really do any work to earn her powers that passed her all the heroism. Unlike Alanna. I'm being a bit unfair to Daine, but I just think of it as a bit unfair to Ala"

I had a tendency to give any book I couldn't specifically remember a 3 (assuming that I neither loved it nor hated it). So all I can say is that I really enjoyed it this time, though I did have a hard time with (view spoiler) [ the whole Daine and Numair thing difficult, because he's like 10 years older than her, and her teacher(!), and I'm pretty sure that I remember from"

I have read this book before, but never finished the series (I just got busy and it fell to the side). Since I still wanted to finish the series I decided to try this as my first audiobook experience. This was a full cast audiobook where Tamora Pierce did the narration and a whole cast of people did the voices for the different characters. It was good (though I do now wonder what I'll think of a single narrator book). I wonde"

Got to meet Daine and follow her as she finds a new set of companions (both human and animal) after her own family was slaughtered. Daine has a definite knack with animals, both for communication and healing. As she and her horse travel, they take up with characters from another series of Pierce (but this book stands alone from the other series -- no worries). As Daine learns the depths and extend of her ""wi"
7507,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"Whenever I'm asked which of Tamora Pierce's series I like best, I always say the Immortals Quartet. I'm not sure if that's true... in fact, while I'm reading her other works, in that moment, that particular story is my favorite. Likewise, Protector of the Small is my 'least favorite' until I read it, at which point I box my own ears and wonder how on earth I could have thought that. Anyways, I do love Wild Magic. It's a perfect introduction to Daine's adventures in learning how to control her mag"
7508,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,"Wild Magic has everything that preteens and young teenagers love: magic, animals, a strong female lead, the promise that excitement exists outside of our every day drudgery... but older teens and adults will feel much less inclined to finish this novel. As an eighth grader, I loved this book so much that I used it for a project in which I got to pick the cast of the movie. When I gave the class presentation, I just kept raving about it and the teacher had to ask me to sit down. As an adult, I've"
7509,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"I was feeling a bit depressed, so I thought that reading a nice adult coming-of-age fantasy would be the perfect solution. And this is the series by Tamora Pierce that was next on my to-read list. Seemed perfect, and I was pretty much right. This, more than any of the other books by Tamora Pierce that I've read, reminded me of Mercedes Lackey's earlier Valdemar books. Poor bereaved and bereft Daine is taken in, discovered to have amazing talents, and ultimately saves the day with them, after a b"
7510,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,"Not much to say here. This is the third series I read from Tamora Pierce. I read the Lionness Quartet first, which was aimed at quite a young audience, then I read Beka Cooper, which, it seems to me, is a little older. Now I move on to this series and the protagonist is all of 13 years old, which stunted my enthusiasm a little. It's pretty typical, tropey even: girl with special powers, mysterious origin, tragic/traumatic experience. She gets more and more special, doing favors for barons and qu"
7511,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"In all seriousness, who really thought I wouldn't like this? NO ONE. That's who. In my triumphant return to Tortall a YEAR after finishing Alanna, I was absolutely not disappointed. I love this book so much, and this series already. It is a little bittersweet to return, and see Alanna, and Jon, and George, and know that I missed nine years, and that I'm not following them, but I fell in love with Daine, Onua, and Numair almost immediately. I've been listening to the audiobook in my car, as well"
7512,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"4.5 Stars. I wish, I wish, I wish that I had found this book as a kid. It was amazing. I don't even know what to say. This book had all of the magic and magical creatures I have ever wanted in a fantasy book, plus an amazing main character and a cast of great side characters. Our main character, Daine, can TALK to animals, which was my childhood dream, and she has magical abilities, including learning how to heal animals and maybe even fantastical creatures like dragons. I mean... It's amazing 😍"
7513,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"Alanna always has a place in my heart, being the first Tammy series I read, but Daine is especially close because of her affinity with animals. I haven't read this series in close to ten years, and the only thing I could remember from that first read was that I didn't like Daine as much as Alanna or Kel -- and now that I'm back to reading her, I'd love to throttle my 15-year-old self and say WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU? This girl is literally perfect. I don't know that there's anything cuter"

Onua, Alanna, George, Buri, Thayet, even Jon (and Daine's friends and all the kids!) * Daine's struggle with her animal friends * DRAGONS (hide spoiler) ] Also, again: it's because in part I am starving for this, but it is so important to me that there are actually people of color in this"
7515,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"Considering this book is basically about a girl who can communicate with animals, not to mention the fact that it takes place in Tortall with Alanna and George and Jon and Thayet plus their kids, it really shouldn't be too surprising how phenomenal this book was! I was so impressed with the way it was done! I was envisioning a Wild Thornberrys type of story, but I never considered the idea of having the animals help fight battles with you! I say again: Phenomenal, Amazing, Favorite, Favorite, Fa"
7516,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,2,"I know Tamora Pierce is capable of creating well-rounded characters. This can be seen in her Circle of Magic books. I also know that her Tortall series is her most popular books. Maybe it's because I don't have enough nostalgia built up around this series, I really didn't like Alanna because I thought she was too perfect, but I find Daine even more whiny and irritating. That and even her magic isn't as interesting as Alanna's. I will say that the plot is a bit faster moving than the Alanna serie"
7517,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"This is the 9th story of Tortall I have read. Somehow I started at the end of the series before I realized there was a connection between the stories. So far I have enjoyed this book the most. Daine has a tortured past and a magical connection to animals which she both cherishes and fears. Hired by the royal horsemistress to drive ponies to Tortall Daine meets a mage who takes her as an apprentice. Although I already know Daine from later books, it didn't disappoint in any way to go back and lea"
7518,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"I recently decided to reread this old favorite. Wild Magic is the first book in the Immortals series. The book focuses on Daine, a young woman who has ""wild magic,"" which gives her the ability to communicate with animals. While the focus on learning to be a mage reminds me more of the Circle of Magic Series (also excellent), the Tortall setting is always a joy to revisit. Thanks to the likable characters, fast moving pace, and thrilling story, Wild Magic remains a great read, despite the fact th"

7520,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"This is a review of a several-times re-read. Daine is fun, although upon re-read, I forgot how easy of a time she has, as compared to some of the other heroines in the series: she's OP as! I still love it, and the enjoyment could still be had in spite of the immensely awful audio reading. This is a case of the author who should absolutely have been told by someone who loved her that she's not good at reading aloud. Phew! And then to add to that, the cast is also awful, not as bad as the narration"
7521,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"This was the first book I ever read of Tamora Pierce. It not only hooked me for the quartet, it hooked me for life. Since then I have nonstop read anything set in the Tortall universe. Pierce weaves tales with little to no holes and the stories are so entrancing that any grievances with her story telling must go unnoticed. Daine is the most modest of personalities in this, the first book, and as you turn the page, she grows into a fire that can’t be stopped. This is a must read series of any gir"
7522,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"An immensely enjoyable read which engulfs you in a realm beyond belief, brought to life through Pierce's descriptions, ingenuity, and sheer talent with particular enthrallment wrapped around the characters as they ease through the plot.the book is filled with magic and fantastic mythical creatures such as dragons, griffins, and stormwings, add to that suspense and drama, and interactions with animals like wolves, horses and bats. The books are so well written and so imaginative It is definitely"
7523,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"Really awesome story. I loved the great majority of the characters, and the story was written in a way that kept me interested the entire time. I thought the ending was a little too abrupt, but otherwise a great book. Would definitely recommend! It wasn't really what I was expecting though, but in a good way. Especially because the beginning of the book makes it seem like the story is going one way, and then suddenly it takes on a whole other unexpected course."
7524,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,2,This book was okay it was boring. I really struggled getting through this book. The book had an interesting and not very clear theme. I felt that it was set in the future. But the future was still in the past compared to now. I thought that it could have been much better written. The preview on the book was up talked more than what the book had in it. Over all it was okay but I would not read it again.
7525,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"4.5 stars What a cool book! I'm really glad I read the first Alanna book before trying this one, although I would recommend reading ALL of them first if you don't want her series spoiled for you (in my case, I'd already accidentally spoiled a lot because I needed to see whether or not the cat was ok in the end haha). You could really read any of Pierce's quartets in any order you like, I think...and you SHOULD read them. I know I'm definitely coming back for more!"
7526,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"This was the first book I ever read by Tamora Pierce and this series will always be among my favorites. The characters are what does it. Daine,Numair, Cloud, Ona...the list goes on and on. Plus the continuation of several characters from Song of the Lioness appear like George, Prince Jonathon, Queen Tyett and of course Alanna herself. Daine's wild magic is so fascinating and all the immortals (Gods and creature alike) are just as interesting. Overall a great opening to an amazing series."
7527,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"This series consumed my youth. I LOVED these novels as a kid. After re-reading, I understand why. Things I liked: -great character development -interesting, fast-paced plot -there are no lags in the story -the world and the characters are charismatic and beautiful -tactful dealing with difficult issues Things I Didn't Like: -sometimes predictable -somewhat optimistic: many of the plans succeed. I would like to see more struggle."
7528,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"Loved this one as much in 2018 as I did all the times I've read it before. Daine is sweet and spunky, and Pierce is second to none when writing young girls coming into their own. The supporting cast (both animal and human) are all a delight, and I laughed out loud more than once at their antics. I'm biased, of course. For me, rereading this book feels like nothing so much as catching up with an old friend."
7529,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"This is the book I needed when I was a thirteen-year-old with untamed hair and too much love for horses and wolves and dragons. This is the book I have been trying to write but didn't have the skill for. It's enchanting, with lovable characters, amazing writing, beautifully and artfully developed magic, an established world and a satisfying reading experience emotionally and logically. Can't believe this is the first Tamora Pierce I've read. It won't be the last!"
7530,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,"First Tamora Pirce book I have read and actually liked thus far. I'll see how the rest of the series goes before I get too excited. Daine was an easy character to like, as were most of the secondary ones, most of whom are from The Lioness Quartet . Daine's magic is vague, but then it usually is in Tortall."
7531,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"I had to reread it as I found the whole Wild Magic series at the used bookstore. I love the Tortall books. Makes me want to reread Alana's story, but Daine is a favorite as well. So good. A girl finds out her magic is needed and appreciated, and her skills are amazing. She explores and learns valuable lessons, becomes strong and makes wonderful friends and family."
7532,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"Definitely YA fantasy, definitely Tamora Pierce, which means I really enjoy it. More complex than ""Song of Lioness"" series in Tortall, which it succeeds, less so than the Trickster's Choice series which follows it. Mostly I'm reading to fill out the backstory of this world before moving onto her later books, but am digging this on its own merits in the meantime."
7533,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"I found this whole series on audiobook by Full Cast Audio on Hoopla. I have read The Immortals series a dozen times at least, and this audiobook recording does it full justice. There are maybe 10-15 character readers per book, and Tamora Pierce voices the main narration. I completely recommend this book in print or audio for anyone who loves animals, magic, or young adult fantasy."
7534,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"Daine. Oh, Daine. I love you! The Immortals quartet has always been my favorite part of the Tortall universe. It's been quite a while since I reread it, but I still love it so much! I want wild magic. Seriously, such a wonderful magical power! I love Daine's growth, her character development. I'm so excited to reread the rest of the quartet!"
7535,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"Wild magic is a wonderful book by Tamora Pierce. It takes place in the same world as the Alanna quartet, and you get to see some of the characters from that series but older. You can read this one first if you want. The main character of this book is very interesting and well-developed. I recommend it for those who love animals, fantasy stories, and interesting female protagonists."
7536,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"I've read this book before, but I always enjoy reading it again. It if full of marvelous characters. Some characters are from other series and some are new. I think the magic highlighted in this book is fascinating. Content: some violence, some innuendo"
7537,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"It's been years since I've read a Tamora Pierce book. I forgot how awesome she is. Nice thing about older books is there's no waiting in between and I can read the rest immediately! Haven't read this series yet, so I'm excited to dive back into the world of Tortall."
7538,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"The Tamora Pierce book that really started it all for me- her best, as far as I'm concerned, and what sparked my passion for fantasy literature and writing. GREAT plot, amazing characters. She blends animals and humans in the most realistic, fasinating way."
7539,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"This will always be my quintessential fantasy novel, my guidepost for a well-told, heart-warming story. I come back to this book at least once a month, and if I don't learn something new about writing at every visit, I always come away feeling a little lighter than I did before."
7540,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,"3 stars from the adult me, but this would definitely be a 5-star book for the 10-year old me - a time when I was reading animal stories and fantasy and wishing I could talk with animals (ok, I still wish that :)"
7541,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"I wish I had discovered Tamora Pierce as a child. This seems like classic young fantasy. I'm so glad that the MC and her mentor aren't romantically involved! I was really worried about that 15 year age difference! Rest assured, y'all!"
7542,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"I enjoyed this book. It was quick and engaging, but Daine wasn't as much of a trope-breaking heroine as Alanna was, and she was a bit (but just a bit) of a Mary Sue. I've already got books 2-4 from the library. Will be banging them out in short order. P.S. BABY DRAGON."
7543,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"Absolutely wonderful. Tamora Pierce has done it again. I forget how many times I have read this book, each time it is absolutely jaw dropping. The characters, the plot, the magic - oh what a wonderful tale. So looking forward to reading the next one."
7544,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,"So the girl who talks to animals makes loads of friends with various creatures and people and then does not make the animals get involved in human affairs if they don't want to be . So good job. Another fun fantasy, just like all of the Tortall books I've read so far."
7545,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,I loved these books when I was 12-13 and they still have the ability to make me smile and love them 7 years later
7546,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,A comfortable friend.
7547,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"Heartfelt, Funny, Page-Turning Read! Loved It!"
7548,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,"Summer 2017 - one of my favorite of Tamra Pierce's books. It's such a comfort book for me, every time I come back to read it."
7549,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,"Yearly re-read: 5/31/16. DAINE IS FOREVER MY FAVORITE, the end. Last reviewed: 1/2013"
7550,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,Good book can't wait to read second one
7551,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,"I would have loved this if I read it about 30 years ago! It's great to see an exciting fantasy with a young, female protagonist."
7552,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,J'adore. So epic and the beloved character appearances made me squeal.
7553,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,I loved it even more the second time around on audiobook. 😍
7554,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,I honestly have no idea how many times I have read this book at this point. I love it every time.
7555,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,"Originally reviewed at Bookwraiths Reviews A long time ago in a decade far, far away . . . I was a teenager! Not only that, I was a fairly arrogant one, who believed that he knew everything, had seen everything worth seeing, done everything worth doing, and had read every fantasy series that mattered. When admitting that, I realize how immensely naive and prideful it all sounds – especially that last bit. However, at the time, I felt my observation about fantasy were completely justified. I mean,"
7556,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"ORIGINALLY POSTED AT Fantasy Literature . There are some fantasy epics that all literature professors, and most normal people, would consider essential reading for any well-educated person -- J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S.Lewis, Lewis Carroll, etc. So, yeah, I read those a long time ago. But beyond that, there's not much fantasy literature that's essential reading. So, for a long time, I didn't read any.

I was sold. Obviously as a writer myself, who is an heir to that honor-ridden, legacy-laced, return-of-the-king obsessed writing culture, I needed to know what a book looked like that COULD be compared to Tolkien ... if for no other reason.

Compared to most of the shallow, sloppy fantasies that are being cranked out these days, this trilogy is absolutely singular in terms of story, world-building, and character development. This is one I come back to--it never disappoints. It was written in the 70s, and while McKillip admits being influenced by Tolkien, she succeeds in creating a unique, complex, and meticulously layered w"
7559,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"The trilogy gets more stars than the main character has on his face. I was generous, even though it has its flaws. Here is why: The way McKillip's ""magic"" system works is so utterly unique that I dare not compare it to anything. Magic is the innate qualities of a thing. You understand the thing completely and you are magically connected to it, able to be it or to use it against others. People are fooled by illusions that are simply the augmentation of a thing's natural qualities, which the tricks"
7560,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,2,"I can't recommend this book. Much is made of the dreamlike quality of McKillip's prose, but I found that this detracted from what could have otherwise been a memorable and different fantasy setting. A large number of intriguing plot points are introduced and then never referred to again, swept away in the preoccupation with the characterless protagonist. As the reader you never gain any appreciation of his (or anyone's) motivation, as the plot moves from one travelogue to another. Here are a few"
7561,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"1. These three novels were really formative for me - I read them, I think, when I was ten (I got this collection for my eleventh birthday, and I'd already read them all at least once). 2. There's a betrayal at the end of the first novel that ruined me for all other fictional betrayals. Caesar? Ned Stark? #KanyeShrug. Probably real life betrayals, too. Whatever happens to me in the future, it won't be as bad as what happened to ten-year-old me at the end of The Riddle-Master of Hed (well, maybe th"

But this other relationship takes the whole trilogy to relat"
7563,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,"Good Fantasy, if somewhat a little predictable. The writing however is pure poetry. McKillip's mastery of the English language is downright breathtaking!"
7564,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"I grabbed a copy of this book to read on a plane to Ireland. The plane landed when I had finished all but one chapter, and I ran to the baggage claim to sit down and finish it. The story was compelling, the writing was exquisite, and McKillip manages the nearly impossible -- in writing about emotions and experiences that are impossible to put into words, she suggests them so well that the reader is able to feel them. It made me choke up in a number of places, even cry in a few, and there are imag"
7565,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,2,"I picked this one up as part of my reading project for this year. I'm really trying to read more books written by ladies pre-2000 in SFF. This definitely fit the bill, but unfortunately it didn't grip me anywhere near as much as I had hoped for... This includes the third and final book in the trilogy which follows Morgon, Prince of Hed, and Raederle, his lady love (I've reviewed the first two individually from this one). In this volume we see both of them come together after much adventuring abo"
7566,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,"When I picked up this book, the only fantasy I had read for a long time were of the large, serial variety (Robert Jordan, George R. R. Martin). I gotta say, this was quite the breath of fresh air. The characters are all likable, the plot and pacing were perfect, and even though this is only one book (it's a trilogy, but the size of it is about the size of one volume of A Song of Ice and Fire, so I think of it as one book), the world is very immersive. The sense of urgency as the hero of the story"
7567,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"Common McKillip themes exemplified by this trilogy: 1) There is nothing which cannot be faced, endured, known, understood. 2) Art conquers all misfortunes. 3) The mind is the most powerful weapon. 4) He who plays God had better be prepared to be God, especially when God turns up and wants his housekeys back. 5) Mess with teenage girls and the shit will be on. 6) Stand by your man. Even if it means turning pirate to hunt the dead bastard down."

McKillip,1,"I bought and read this book on the recommendation of several family members who had read the original books when they were first published (and when they were much younger readers).

7569,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,2,"While McKillip's prosaic writing is masterful, it also makes the book very difficult to read. I found myself screaming, ""just get on with it!"". While the most interesting characters were never fully developed, the title character was overdeveloped and unlikeable. I grew weary of the constant whining over his destiny, remorse for things he did, or expostulating on everything from life mysteries to romantic endeavors. She wanted to create a Tolkein-like world, but ended up with only the dismal sha"

It's pretty good. What makes it fascinating is that it was written by a woman in the early-to-mid nineteen seventies. It predates Brooks and (by decades) Eddin"
7571,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,"Explicitly inspired by — but no slavish imitation of — The Lord of the Rings , Patricia McKillip’s trilogy is an epic fantasy that stands on its own merits rather than in comparison with Tolkien’s work. Yes, it starts with a very domestic scene before exploring from one end of a continent to the other, and, indeed, the main protagonist is reluctant to embark on his quest, but in reality the whole feel and mood of McKillip’s narrative is far removed from Tolkien’s, not least because it gives almos"

On the one hand, I liked a lot about it, and liked the way it meandered about and came at a couple question in interesting ways. On the other hand, this book was a bit dense in places and I didn't really feel that it helped the narrative to circle back and back to certain things, and there were parts where I just wanted to know what was happenin"

But then suddenly, I found myself swept up by the mastery of the simplicity and I was in love with the world and the characters and the plots. The beauty is in the simplicity. The sparseness that still somehow captivates you. What this book does that so many modern books fail to do is that it gives you almost everything. It gives you enough and th"
7575,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,"mckillip tells us right up front in her introduction that this trilogy is a)inspired by tolkein and b)neither her favorite nor her best writing. she's quite correct on both counts. telling the tale of a backwater prince (a somewhat large fish in a tiny pond, not entirely unlike certain hobbits) discovering his true destiny and just how important he is to saving the land from an incomprehensible evil, the structure is rather tolkeinesque. sadly, the best and worst of that work is stashed in here,"

Plus, since I read it that way, it was like reading one longer book (which I prefer) to three shorter books. Anyway, I really enjoyed these books.

7584,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,Really enjoyed this book! I appreciated the section in the back of the book with all of the characters as there are a lot. My one wish/complaint is the lack of first person narrative from Raederle in the 3rd book. I wish we could learn more about her growth in magic! I picked up this book in a search for fantasy novels with strong female characters which this book definitely had but there could have been more.
7585,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,"Long read, but definitely worth it."

I love fantasy, and I love being taken to the heights of imagination in a good story – so long as one foot remains firmly planted on the ground. There has to be a connection to life as I know it in order for the fantasy to work and to hold my interest. I doubt I’m alone in this.

She has a way of weaving images in and out of the plot, the result being a thick, comfy, lush tapestry of world-and-story. Aspiring fantasy writers should read this trilogy simply to study the beauty of language and its possibilities. The overarching plot is engaging, but I hesitate to give the trilogy five stars because, well, the ending didn't really grab me. The big revelations--the moments of explanation, whe"

It would be a great book for a young adult. For me, it was missing a bit of grit. Everyone was so trusting and cooperative. Even when the characters had some emotional outburst, everyone was understanding and forgiving. The villains were even made to seem sympathetic. At least the end of the story acknowledged how trusting the entire world was an"

I picked it up again this summer after reading some other Patricia McKillip stories. I wish I hadn't. It just doesn't hold up over time. After reading J.R.R. Tolkien, Terry Goodkind, George R.R.

A flurry of strange names in the opening chapters--it's hard to get oriented in this odd world. Lots of cryptic riddles, few answers that I can understand.

Great monomachies come to no definite conclusion. The cha"

McKillip's use of language is wonderful and richly detailed, and I liked the way Morgon in particular seems so young for the role he's forced to take, uncertain at first in his choices.

I had several false starts and trouble getting through the first chapter, but once I got to about page 30 I was hooked and couldn't put it down. I was also a bit put off by McKillip's introduction. She almost seems to come down hard on the young idealistic author that she used to be and not give the book enough credit. She says that she was inspired by the Lord of the Rings trilogy and want"
7599,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,"""The world ... is not a safe place for harpists."" I was well into the second section of the book before I realized that these were three separate books combined into one. I liked having them all together in one place because the story needs all the parts to be complete. This is a rich fantasy world, and McKillip fleshes out the story and magic with skill, even though at times the language seems a bit murky and sluggish. I like our double protagonists, Morgon of Hed and Raederle. I also like our"
7600,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"This is such a dense trilogy, with so many layers that hide beneath the quest narrative surface. I found so much to wonder and marvel at, such as Morgon turning into a tree or the majestic purple eyed vesta. I know that I will read this again, there are so many subtle links that I am sure I did not see them all. Mckillip's writing is superb and she is a master of the genre. I cannot wait to read more of her work and to re-read this classic of fantasy. I recommend this to anyone who loves quest d"
7601,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"I've read this trilogy (in its separate books, the originals from the 70s) many, many times. I bought this trilogy edition and read it and this time it didn't hold up as well as it has in the past. I was slightly impatient with the books' slow pacing (particularly the last book) and eager to finish it. Overall, though, this is an excellent trilogy for kids or adults who like fantasies with depth and intelligence. The story is intriguing and the characters are interesting. For some reason I can n"
7602,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,"This is the first book I read by Patricia McKillip. I was looking for a good fantasy author and she was touted as ""the best fantasy author you're probably not reading."" I was understandably curious. I enjoyed the story of Morgon, the Riddlemaster and Prince of Hed as he leaves his idyllic farmstead and embarks on a journey to fulfill a destiny already mapped out centuries before he was born. Morgon's internal conflict is highly engaging and I didn't hesitate to pick up Book 2 in this series."
7603,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,2,"I found the series in general underwhelming. Characters were fairly generic and indistinguishable, and a lot of the book seems to be sandbagged by lengthy descriptions of nature while traveling from place to place. In addition, many of the so called 'riddles' are not riddles at all, but simply questions and plot elements to be resolved. For example, ""what happened to the main character who has vanished?"". Maybe there is some depth in the symbolism and diction that ghosted through my consciousnes"
7604,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"You can ignore all the low star reviews on this trilogy. If you look at the reading habits of those reviewers, you'll discover several common elements to their opinion: 1) They don't read much. 2) They don't read much adult fantasy. 3) They believe all fantasy after Lord of the Rings is plagiarized. 4) They believe Harry Potter could have done a better job destroying the One Ring, solo, walking uphill both ways, in the snow, surrounded by orcs... I love people's opinions. But read a few hundred books"
7605,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"""He picked his way across the ceiling, which lay in pieces on the floor"" The prose is kaleidoscopically beautiful, like a hazy dream. The magic system is utterly novel, too. e.g Using words and the true essence of a thing in order to have power over it. Lovely classic that not many know of! At times it's like slipping into an old skin, at others, the sheer wonder leaves sparks in the mind's eye. Best of the Tolkien clones. Or better. (Put down your pitchforks people, please!)"
7606,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"Pretty unique as an idea.It's not every day we see a man with nothing but his knowledge and riddles to overcome such obstacles the way Morgon does.Usually,the main heroes have some kind of supernatural powers.And I kept guessing and un-guessing(is that even a word?XD) till the very end about many things concerning the story."
7607,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,"A very different fantasy, and very readable. The world she developed has a unique culture, the story line has a tempo that varies (not all rush, rush, rush - some fast paced, some more moderate), interesting take on heirs to kingdoms, and quite a few twists, turns and revelations that kept me enthralled. Also very re-readable."
7608,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"I think this was the book that defined high fantasy for me. So beautifully written and so delicately complex that I had to read it several times before I truly understood what had happened. There's a hero, a quest, a harpist, riddles, true love, it's epic. But it's epic in a quiet, sensual way that stayed with me for a long time after I read it. McKillip's writing is, for me, near perfection."
7609,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,Patricia McKillip is a master story-teller. She has a unique way of building a world that has depth and substance. Reading this book feels like you are getting a glimpse of a place with both a history and a future. There is nothing flat or predictable about her writing. The ending will surprise and touch you.
7610,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"This was a gift for my daughter this summer, but I just had to reread it before the summer ended. Since this was my first week of classes, I was a bit behind my goal, but this book is like a wonderful gourmet meal. The plot is so captivating, the language so beautiful, the imagery so powerful, the experience so altering that it must be savoured instead of gulped. What a timeless masterpiece!!!"
7611,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"Just finished another re-read of this omnibus, my three separate books version is rather fragile after so many time being read. I have loved this story ever since I first found it (back when it was new) and am particularly delighted that there is a new essay by the author at the beginning talking about the intervening time etc."
7612,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,"There are parts of this book that are really beautifully written, and the first book in the trilogy is great (and ends on a super cliffhanger!) but there is just something indefinable missing from it all that left me unsatisfied and made it hard to actually finish."
7613,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"My favourite set of books. Ever. The greatest influence upon my life and my inspiration to become an author. The books are fantasy, with a fascinating world. But above all the story is about love, and hate, and love despite betrayal."
7614,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"Phenomenal fantasy. Unforgettable characters, unforgettable world. Confusing in parts but that's probably just me. Quality time spent reading this gem. Definitely worth a re-read, I'm sure I'll appreciate everything even more, probably get the confusing parts, too."
7615,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,Still one of the most beautifully written books I've read.
7616,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,another of those books i periodically re-read twenty years later...
7617,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,Classic fantasy that I have reread many times.
7618,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,One of my all-time favorites.
7620,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"Of all the words to describe the Riddle-Master trilogy, ""inheritor"" might be the most apt to begin with. This book is a spiritual successor to Tolkien in a way that very few fantasy series have ever managed. McKillip places the emphasis of her conflict on adventure, not action, and the plot is undertaken by the unlikeliest and most pitiful of creatures. In Middle-earth, a hobbit; in Riddle-master, a pig-farmer of Hed. McKillip is also preoccupied with riddles, although she changes the rhythm to so"
7621,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,"As I finished each book of the trilogy, I wrote down my thoughts. The are as follows: The Riddle-Master of Hed is the first book in Patricia A. McKillip's Riddle of Stars trilogy. This is a magical, wonderful novel. McKillip's prose unfolds effortlessly, a simple, beautiful, straightforward style of writing that nonetheless contains great power and depth, like a strong current of water flowing beneath a gleaming, sparkling river of ice. McKillip's fantasy world unfolds organically; her text is no"
7622,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"One sentence keeps popping up when either someone speaks about fantasy or a author talks about how to write fantasy. SENSE OF WONDER, this assumes you are speaking in english of course but id even go so far that even if its another language they may use the english term ""sense of wonder"" (sow) since its just that useful. In more modern fantasy this is partly thrown to the wayside and less poetic approach is taken more logic in both the world and the characters, but usually you still want SoW. Bu"
7623,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,"I read all three books in one volume, so I didn’t make the clearest distinction between books. I liked the series quite a bit, though I didn’t think that it was the greatest display of storytelling talent I’ve ever read. It seemed to me that Patrick Rothfuss has taken quite a bit from this story though. Naming; Shaping; harping in wild lonely places, asleep to oneself. The Wind being a powerful and central element. There was a lot that made it feel like a less well-written version of the Kingkill"
7624,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"At first this book seemed to follow the familiar path of 'country boy discovers he is the Chosen One, travels through all the lands of the realm to find answers, and finally confronts the Big Bad Guy'. I'm not generally a fan of familiar paths, but this one was beautifully written, so I enjoyed it nonetheless. Then came the ending of the first book, which put the whole thing on its head, and soon I had no idea what to expect anymore. I loved the twists and turns of the plot, the complexity of som"
7625,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,"Book 1: Beautifully written with some pretty fun and engaging characters, but where's the plot? There's a plot for sure, but it never really feels like it's going anywhere. The descriptions are wonderful, but the history and setting of the world are very confusing, as we are never given any insight on their background, history or purpose. Random names and terms are just thrown around without any explanation as to what they mean or why they're important. Despite some major flows, it peaked my int"
7626,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,"This is actually three books, a trilogy published together in one binding. McKillip is an award winning fantasy author, the back of the book blurbs comparisons to Lord of the Rings, and in her introduction she makes clear that Tolkien is the driving inspiration for her writing, so I was excited to dig into this. Well. It's interesting enough that I wanted to see it through, but I can't really recommend it, and anyone who compared this to LotR either never read those books, never read these, or is"
7627,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"Once in awhile, there will be a magical book with sublime prose that transports you into another world. For me, it has happened with books like The Fionavir Tapistry by Guy Gavriel Kay. And now with the Riddle-Master. After finishing it, I immediately went back to page one to try and reabsorb some of that magic. It's hard to describe the writing. Yes, it's lyrical and poetic but much more than that. The words flow into each other, every one in place and perfect. There are no extraneous bits nor"
7628,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"Fantastic. This was my introduction to Patricia A. McKillip and she did not disappoint. Beautiful writing. Beautiful story. Her prose is poetic. There's depth woven throughout her words, the words and sentences strung together are stories themselves. It's one thing for a writer to craft a great story it's another for them to draw you closer with their use of language. She made me wonder how her mind works. How did this story come to be, I mean piece by piece? There's a lot of emotion in these wo"
7629,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,"Going to review the three books in separate sections. The Riddle-Master of Hed: I initially really enjoyed this, and it's my favourite out of the trilogy. Morgon learning to shapeshift in various ways was especially cool. Lack of female characters was annoying. Heir of Sea and Fire: Female POVs were refreshing, but I was frustrated by the whole story nonetheless revolved around Morgon. OK sure, he's the chosen one, but still: Raederle and Lyra's agency felt diminished since they were just looking"
7630,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,"A few days ago I came across such a wonderfully caustic review of a book I had just read that I felt the need to check out what the writer of that review ( https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4... ) did enjoy. Patricia McKillip was high on the list, so I picked one, pretty much at random, and read through it. I'm glad I did - it was well written, didn't allow the romance to ride away with the story, and - at least for the first two volumes - had direction and push. Unfortunately, the author seemed"
7631,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"An incredibly beautifully devised series, echoing Welsh mythology and bringing in new myths of it's own. If you weren't already a fan of her writing I would hope this would convert you. There's an echo of Joan Aiken's Harp of Fishbones here - The author lays out a country tied through land law to controlling rulers who invest power into their Landheirs, Magicians are riddle masters, puzzling through centuries of history to find answers to past devastation they only have scraps of details for -an"
7632,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,"It's the classic Fantasy story about a boy looking for the truth, the forgotten history of the realm and his role in all of this. I sometimes found it a bit difficult to read due to the writer's imaginative and descriptive way of writing but I think that might be because English is not my mother language. I occasionly also struggled with the names of characters because they are very similar and confusing. And often characters are brought back I have forgotten completely about but luckily the edi"
7633,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,2,"I liked the idea behind the book. There was just something in the writing style that made it difficult for me to really get into the rhythm of storytelling. Sometimes it was an awkwardly used pronoun that caused character confusion, other times a key action would be hidden at the end of a very long descriptive paragraph. The descriptions were very good and the dialogue was well done. I found myself more interested in some of the side characters than the main ones. Mathom, Har, and the tree king"
7634,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"My god, a masterpiece The prose is perfect - tentative, probing, exploring and enticing without revealing. It's its own thing, in a way. Disjointed and breathtaking in equal measure. The characters are sublime - filled with such rich nuance and complexity that they leap off the page. They struggle as much against themselves as they do their destinies. The world building is deep, rich, and built up slowly. This is a complete gem and frankly I'm mad I had never heard of it until now! Buy it!"
7635,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,"I am sure that I might give this book a better rating if I had read all three of the books in the trilogy. First, the place and character names come flying at you with abandon - and many are never heard from again in this book. Perhaps they will be revisited in the next two nooks. Second, the story is incomplete. It would be better to set expectations that this is only the setup for the next book, so the reader does not expect a complete story line."
7636,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"Painfully beautiful prose. I think there were some cliches, some plot issues, but the descriptions, characters and settings were so varied and so very rich I really didn't care. I got swept up in it. I felt like I went on that journey with Morgon, I felt like all of those people and places existed--this all happened somewhere some time long ago. This story is told with such care and such compassion. I can't imagine it ever not being a favorite."
7637,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"This is the kind of book that stays with you long after you've finished reading it. I find myself pondering, questioning, turning characters and plot points over in my mind, looking at the storyline with fresh eyes. This book will make for an interesting re-read, I think. It's a riddle in itself - though I am pleased that I called the major twist before it was revealed. Finishing Riddle-Master is like stepping out of a dream. It has a melancholy aftertaste. But a good one."
7638,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,2,"I got 2 books into this and put it down shortly after starting the third one. The characters are more of official fantasy Types than they are real people, and every time they start to get a little real they double down on being a Type. I'm sure this is a good example of a Fantasy Epic That Follows The Types but that kind of thing is not really my jam. I can see why this series ended up out of print."
7639,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,"Definitely interesting reading a fantasy trilogy that I didn't know anything about. At the end of it all, I'm not sure I know a ton more about it. :) No, seriously though, these books were mysterious, telling a story as though the reader knew quite a bit more about this world than we did. That was intriguing and kept me reading, learning along the way. Makes you work a bit. And some of it is described more than explained. But I liked it more than I disliked it."
7640,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"This series speaks to me. I have read it three times. Each time I read it I am transported into a world of legends and runes. The author has a unique style that makes her novels feel like legends. This being one of her first works I cannot advocate for incredible writing, but still I find myself reading it multiple times. For some reason I find it beautiful."
7641,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"Epic and amazing I read this when it first came out. I was a teenager who discovered fantasy through Ms. McWilliams realm. As a lifelong fantasy reader I still rank this trilogy as one of the best, most human stories I have ever read. Thank you for the many, many times I have been completely absorbed in the epic story of a prince from Hed."
7642,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,Patricia A. McKillip just makes such fun fantasy worlds where it all seems so real and alive. There's a quality to her writing that is just whimsical and fairy tale-like. The Riddle-Master trilogy is no exception. There's a lot of mystery involved here (as riddles may suggest) and seeing how the characters deal with these mysteries is a joy. Totally recommend.
7643,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,2,"I really didn't enjoy this series. It seemed like it would be amazing, but it really fell flat. I couldn't really follow the story and a lot of things did not make sense."
7644,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"This book is beautiful, harrowing, tragic fantasy, written by an author gifted in lyrical prose. I get lost in her imagery, lingering over the unique and magical images she invokes."
7645,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,1,It was hard to adhere to this book and there were no actual riddles :(
7646,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,Loved it! Glad I recently stumbled onto this author again. Fresh world. Fresh characters.

7661,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"The Riddle-Master trilogy is a wonderful, fantastical series. The world-building is intricate and purposeful. I highly recommend it to anyone that loves high fantasy. The difficulty in this series lies in the first installment, The Riddle-Master of Hed. The story is highly condensed, and I think suffers from pacing problems. Much of this most likely has to do with the time it was published, 1976 - there wasn't much opportunity for the long fantasy volumes that are now commonplace. The journey of"

After reading The Riddle Master of Hed and being in so so much awe with the astounding perfection of the story, characters and, of course, McKillip's beautifully eloquent writing, I did experience some disappointments reading the rest of the trilogy.

These books tell a story that on the surface might seem kind of cliched: Morgon, Prince of Hed, after recovering an old artifact in a riddle contest, finds himself pursuing a mysterious destiny. Morgon travels across a realm where long-vanished magic and ancient forces are re-emerging, and along the way he discovers many hidden things about the land and himself. At t"

I think I spent about $7, but that was a lot of money to a seventh-grader who earned her pocket money babysitting at $1/hour and doing chores at 10 cents each. At the time, I thought it must've been a great purchase because I read the entire series seven times in a row that summer, and continue to reread it occasionally over the years until the books fell apart.

His chief companions are the High One's harpist Deth and Raederle, promised by her father to the man who won the crown--if she can find him first.

7668,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"It's not a matter of if Patricia McKillip is ""all that fantasy should be"" or if she is ""Tolkienesque"" or ""a fine story teller."" Patricia McKillip should be compared to Cormac McCarthy. They write the same hinting, dense, lyrical prose. The only difference is the subject matter. I also appreciate Patricia McKillip for bringing me forgiveness, loyalty, freedom, acceptance, bravery of mind-- the true themes of her books.

On the one hand, it vacillates widely between being so fast-paced the reader is in danger of dizzily missing important details and such intricately paced, experiential world-building details that the reader may get bored.

Now, to be fair with myself and anyone else who happens upon this review...I should have read these books separately and not as one giant book. That was my first mistake. My second mistake was putting this book aside for 2+ months. I should have just stuck with it and finished it out. During the break I forgot who many of the characters were, the places, and the side story lines. But that doesn't mean that 3 out of 5 stars is an undeserving"
7672,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,"This is the second book I've read by Patricia McKillip (the other being The Bards of Bone Plain , which I thoroughly enjoyed). This book (or trilogy, to be more accurate) was very enjoyable, but at times a little frustrating, in that the plot could be a bit hard to follow. It's a story about a Riddle Master, who is trying to solve the most complex riddle of all, his own identity. Answers come slowly, and aren't fully revealed until the last few pages of the final book. There are many parts of the"
7673,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,"Riddle-Master is an avowedly Tolkienian work. It starts with the standard map of the realm. It takes place in a vaguely medieval world of kings and farmers and wizards and such. The hero comes from a quiet, idyllic, rural place, set aside from the wider world of swords and sorcery. The tropes of western folktales abound, including the hero with a hidden destiny, magical objects, shape-changers, and of course lots of traveling on that map from page one. This is an omnibus edition collecting the a"
7674,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,"Patricia McKillip has been one of those authors who I could take or leave and usually left just because my to-read list is so long. I have the feeling that has changed over the course of the last week. Reading the Riddle-Master The Riddle-Master Books 1-3 trilogy was for me an excercise in reading at points. For the first 124 pages, or most of The Riddle-Master of Hed The Riddle-Master Book 1 I plowed through the book. The pacing seemed slow. The descriptions, though amazing and inventive, were n"
7675,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,"Well ..... that was odd. I liked parts of it so much, and other parts confused me. The answer to the riddle at the end was amazing - the plot planning in this book is astounding. You might feel like giving up when you read it, but don't! It's so worth it!"
7676,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"I read this trilogy every few years or so, and find myself still amazed at McKillip's wit and imagination. The trilogy is about a young farmer named Morgon of Hed, the landmaster of a quiet, nondescript island named Hed; ""landmastery"" is a hereditary talent, given to the land's ruler, wherein that ruler knows (and, in a very common sense, is ) every inch and stone and plant and animal on his or her land.

7677,Riddle-Master,Patricia A.

Together with The Lord of the Rings and the Dragonriders of Pern series, these books were my introduction to fantasy and I’ve loved the genre ever since. I originally bought The Heir of Sea and Fire first (the second book in the series), simply because I was intrigued by the cover - the scene where Raederle, the heroine, bargains with one o"
7678,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"Patricia McKillip is one of my favourite authors not just because she writes a good story, she also writes with lyricism and warmth. Her characters are believable and complex, her story lines have surprised me and to be honest I'm difficult to surprise - there are only so many storylines in the fantasy genre and it's a rare writer who finds a new one. Patricia is a master at new and exciting storylines. The land itself is a character in this set of books, and each country has it's own rules and p"
7679,Riddle-Master,Patricia A.

But this humility emphasizes that the world of Riddle-Master is small. At times the entire population seems to be no more than a few thousand.

The reason is the idea that I may not be able to correctly capture the beauty and complexity of the storylines. I do not have a background in literature and poetry to undergird my attempts to write a review here as I do a background in studying philosophy to help me write a review for some other books. This book is *that* beautiful, yes. The storyline is hard to describe without giving away too many spoilers. The main details"
7681,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"Patricia A. McKillip grew stylistically more mature with her later fantasy novels, but never, I think, has she done such a good job of portraying the delicate interplay of trust and doubt in a friendship. The Riddle-Master trilogy tells the story of Morgon, Prince of Hed, land-ruler of an island country of stubborn farmers. True to his roots, Morgon wants nothing more than to remain at home with his younger brother and sister. But when he meets the harpist of the High One - the High One being the"
7682,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,"As this is the entire trilogy in one volume, I'll comment on each book separately as I finish them. 1) The Riddle-Master of Hed: The beginning of Our Hero's quest to unravel the riddles that reveal the fate of the World and his true Destiny (all the while resisting the urge to just pack it all up and go home). A LOT of characters are introduced, and it's a bit unclear just who will be important later. However, the back of the book compares the author to Tolkien, and I can see why. Her world is co"
7683,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,"First of all, I'd like to say that I think editors do great disservice to readers, authors, and books themselves by slapping ""good enough to be compared to Tolkien"" on the back of them. Yeah, it's a complicated plot with lots of ancillary characters. Yes, it's an epic continent-crossing journey. It certainly has a similar mystical-but-not-exactly-magic feel to the special powers of several characters, especially rulers and leaders. And, yeah, it's a story about someone taking on a huge destiny t"
7684,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,"It's hard to know where to begin with this one. The world is a place where rulers have something called the ""land-rule,"" which seems like a kind of psychic power but is more like a bone-deep knowledge of their land and the living things on it. Morgon, the main character of the first book, holds the land-rule of Hed, a quiet and peaceful island where farmers farm and most of the ruling he does involves helping to fix people's roofs. As you might expect, the book starts off a little slow. But it q"
7685,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"This series has a slow start, but gradually lures you in - give it a little time. Most of McKillip's writing is jewel-like with lovely imagery. There's a surprising amount of humor in her books, as well, it just leans towards subtlety. Edit: 2/2/2014 I've been re-reading this in bits and pieces here and there and finally finished tonight. It is still 5 stars, and still beautiful. It's my go-to ""escape"" book and now I want to jump back in and buy the rest of McKillip's books. I loved the idea of t"

7687,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,"I had problems with this book, but at no point did I feel like giving up on it and it's really three and a half stars, if only for the writing. My first problem was riddles and shape shifters: two things I usually dislike, but it turned out that riddles only meant requesting knowledge and shape-shifting wasn't corny werewolves, so these were not problems at all. What bothered me was motivation. I couldn't understand why characters behaved as they did. I know that in some magic systems, knowing s"
7688,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,2,"I have to agree with those who gave this book an average to poor rating - I liked the book as a child, but upon re-reading it, found it ridiculously flawed, largely for the reasons already stated in other peoples reviews. None of the characters draw you in or make you really care and the story is garbled and unconvincing. It is a shame to write this, as I really enjoyed the book when I first read it. For me though, it is a case of what could have been. Some of the ideas in the book are really gr"
7689,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"It's easy to understand why this is considered one of the fantasy classics. Patricia McKillip weaves an epic story of lyrical beauty, with high stakes, passionate characters, such vivid scenes and so much emotion, I believe some of the images will live forever in my mind. Absolutely recommended. An aside: I guess every SF book builds on top of other stories, but I find it an special treat to see where an author might have gone ""oh, that's not how I'd done it"".

But I got The Riddle-Master of Hed from the library, and read it that day; went back to the library in the afternoon to get Heir of Sea and Fire ; and got Harpist in the Wind the next day. Then I bought the single-volume edition (though I think I'd rather have the individual books). The ending, when Morgon and Raederle walk back from the beach to their house, is beautifully simple, the perfect ending to a book of Byzantine complexity, in which riddles are piled upo"
7691,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"This is simply a beautiful book. The writing is beautiful - poetic but purposeful. The plot is beautiful - simple, but layered enough to warrant re-reading. The characters are beautiful - neither heroes nor mundane, and straightforward but with layers of complexity. The worldbuilding is beautiful - it never really gets in the way of the story, and while the world is fairly small, it carries a sense of wholeness. It's a little more concrete than many of McKillip's other books, which tend to get d"

Patricia McKillip uses language beautifully and deliberately, and her love for her characters and the world she's created come through very clearly. I can't help but fall in love with her characters, too, and root for the same characters she's obviously rooting for. My heart broke a little at the end of this trilogy, and I cried through the last few chapters.

It's a good Fantasy Series but I was almost never caught by it and it's certainly not in the same league of the great classics of the High Fantasy. The world (3,50) is a fantasy world well built but it lacks... normality: when more than half the people we meet are several centuries (at least) old or are"
7694,Riddle-Master,Patricia A.

After reading McKillip's latest, The Bards of Bone Plain this month, though, the similar themes made me want to pick it up again. It's still over-long (especially that last book) and wanders a bit, but the fantasy land and the system of magic she created are great, and so is the supporting cast of characters. A lot of things abo"
7695,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,"I enjoyed this the second time around-a second time based on a friend's recommendation. A kind of Lord-of-the-Rings lite. I've never [yet] come across a similar underlying purpose/ability?? as used in this trilogy. The first time I read it: I began this story with high hopes—its introduction mentioned the author’s influence by Tolkien. McKillip has an interesting premise that really needs to be better developed. Even though she spent 12 years creating this trilogy, she needs to spend a few more y"
7696,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"McKillip is an amazing author. The story may start a little slow, with a small mystery, but with each attack, each nugget of additional information, the story builds. Each book in the trilogy ends with a mind-blowing revelation that makes you wonder how she will top it. I had guesses, but no way did I guess the final climax; I had to go back and think to see how it all fit together. Incredible how she fit it all together. It does get rather dark toward the end, seeing as there's a major war and"

I do find that I keep forgetting names though, and then a character will pop back up and I'll go ""crap, I know I'm supposed to know who that is!"" I really like some parts of this, though, I'm glad I stuck with it so far... ETA: I just finished this book. Wow. I'm so glad I stu"
7698,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,"I admire Patricia McKillip's dialogue style in this trilogy. It's somber, cerebral, and quiet. (Note that I didn't say the narration; McKillip doesn't sound like Ernest Hemingway.) I have studied it, even, because as an aspiring novelist, I would like my characters to sound somewhat like McKillip's if possible and if appropriate. I think the Riddle-Master Trilogy is stronger in characterization than in plot. There was always a quality of limited detail about the events, the antagonists, McKillip'"

Oddly I hadn't returned to it since that first read 10 years ago, and when looking for something to read out-loud we grabbed this one off the shelf. It's a compendium of the three original books in the series, which I would recommend for anyone to get - all three are less than 500 pages. The first two books are incredible, but the first half"

Some characters are awesome like Raederle, Dadan or the Wolf-king, but the main character wasn't, in my view, up to the task. Sometimes you'll end up not feeling for the character or finding strange that all others give him so much importance without any real motive. To sum it up, he simply lacks charisma. Since this book is a trilogy, if i had to rate it i would giv"

I read the first third - The Riddle-Master of Hed - though I almost abandoned it literally 3 pages from the end, because the single-edition trilogy didn't give any physical clues as to when it was over and God knows the story didn't. It was...not pacey. The main character spends the book travelling across the land, repeating a brief, proscribed conversation that's all about him (and never once asking anyone else how their day was!). The conversati"

I found myself going back to one of the first scenes in part one after I finished, seeing suddenly details fall into place that I could never have understood when I first read it. The author wrote this trilogy after she read The Lord of the Rings when it was new. She wanted to write something as good as that. I like Riddle-Master much better than Lord of the Rings. Even suspecting t"
7703,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,"For me, this book feels like a mix between Wizard of Earthsea , Tales of the Dying Earth , and Songmaster . The story is set in a world of name magic, but instead of the usual power over the thing you name, you also get empathy with what you name. This small change has implications that flow throughout the book. Perhaps the part I liked best was the simple idea that the nobility had this name power over all from within their realm. This forces these people to be more kind and practical than what"
7704,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,"I had never heard of this book before I saw it on some Internet list of books with crazy cover art, which is unfortunate, because this is probably one of the best fantasy trilogies out there. The world of the High One should be put up there with Middle Earth, Pern, Earthsea and other classic fantasy lands as an equal. McKillip is a fine writer, and although the story may have started slow, once I caught on, I was captured by the story of one man's quest to find out who he is. Sure, the tropes ar"

I tend to be a speed reader and figured out that does not work well with this book. There are a lot of details, that if you skip them over tend to make the book confusing and hard to understand. Ordinarily I can still get enough of the gist to keep reading, but in this case it really cut down on my enjoyment. So, this time I forced myself to slow down and go back if it g"

Fabulous, I love it, etc. I have read this several times, and of course every time it is new as I can never remember exactly what happens.

It's dreamlike rhythms are so different than the fantasy I am used to reading--slower and in soft focus. I didn't succumb to its charms until I slowed myself down. Once I did, though...McKillip's prose is so assured. It is never ostentatious, but suffused with small charms always: just the right exchange between characters, or the poignant image, or the unassuming but perfect turn of phrase. So much of the story is bu"
7709,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,2,"Lots of interesting ideas, but I abandoned the trilogy after the second book. It just didn't ""click"" for me - the pacing seemed awkward and I never connected with or quite understood the characters' motivations or why their relationships would suddenly be so close. There also seemed to be a lack of continuity - characters that I liked in passing would return and I wouldn't even recognize them at first. I felt that the story moved and deepened much too quickly without an adequate grounding. By th"
7710,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"One of my all time favorites. Truly a classic in every sense of the word. McKillip's writing is very rich and she hits many, many high-notes with this trilogy. It starts a bit slow with a seemingly well-trod ""provincial lad on his way to being a hero"" path, but please don't be dismayed because these book s are truly unique. The magic system is beyond awesome and the changes in the characters that come with this power and the greater understanding of it are masterfully rendered. The story swells a"

I especially thought the land-law/land-rule concept was interesting and epitomized what I like, it was extraordinary, but just so, not over the top, it could be real, it didn't seem silly, just an extra-layer on normal reality that made sense and added depth. However by the end of the second book where the main love int"

The protagonist was tiresomely whiney in the first novel of the trilogy. There were gaping chasms in the world-building where key terms and concepts were left unexplained, and not even for a clear narrative purpose. The plot-twists were obvious and heavily telegraphed. All of the people in positions of authority turned out to be benevolent a"

The story also has intense philosophical underpinnings, borrowing plenty from the usual fantasy fanfare but also expanding them in depths in ways unrecognizable from the bland tomes that populate shelves. There are so many good things to be said about the quality of the book, but I still prefer the author's single volumes stories, as I fee"

Probably when I was 10 or 11, just as I was seriously getting into fantasy, looking frantically for something like the lord of the rings. Riddle Master filled that void nicely and has been one of my favorite trilogies since then. It is definitely am older style of fantasy than what is common today.

You might feel lost sometimes, but you feel like you've experienced something worth the effort because it teaches you things that you can't learn in any other way.

I've read lots of McKillip's later works, but for some reason this original masterpiece of her has been evading me, even though I've had the book in my shelf for couple of years. McKillip has created an intriguing world, with riddles, land-law, harpists and the elusive High One. McKillip says she was inspired by Tolkien's work, yet there is very little of Tolkien in this story.

7738,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"Out of all the thousands of books I've read this is my utter favorite. Why so? It's subtle. It's magical. The story line is intricate and nuanced. Our hero faces his fears and eventually understands them, without everything being explained. There's a backstory which is only hinted at and which becomes an integral part of the story itself. Every two or three years I pick up this old favorite from the bookshelf and read this with great joy. I remember things I've forgotten and once again thrill at"
7739,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,2,"Back and forth over the world doing high fantasy I love McKillip's writing, and remembered fondly reading the first book of this trilogy, but on retreading the books I have no idea how I endured it. There isn't really a plot to speak of, just the hero rushing from place to place on the latest urgent and driven magical mission, often in animal form, pausing occasionally to try to make his girlfriend go home for her own good. (She refuses) McKillip has polished her game since, thank goodness."
7740,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,2,"I really enjoyed the first book. It had real and enjoyable characters. Unfortunately from the second book, the story just became more abstract and the characters less vivid. Various powers are thrown around for no real reason and nobody has any idea of what to do. It seems to amble around from place to place forever until finally it runs out of words. There's some lovely images and writing in there, buried beneath the travelling, but it's a rather boring read of random mysticism after the first"
7741,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,"One of my favorite fantasy authors (Jacqueline Carey) recommended this series, so I thought I might give it a try. I immediatly fell in love with the writing style - it's very lyrical, enchanting, mysterious. It was a pure joy discovering this magical world and its rules. I would also recommend it because it features a strong and powerful woman in a lead role, which is something I always appreciate in a fantasy novel. In fact, Raederle is a wonderful character. Maybe this is why I enjoyed the se"
7742,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,"My son had the first volume of this trilogy on his shelf. I read it and had to keep going. McKillip has created a complex world where Riddle Masters maintain all the history, logic, and philosophy in the form of riddles. The characters are interesting and so numerous that the trilogy has a 6-page list of people and places at the end. The story line, while endlessly unexpected, is often hard to puzzle out. If I read it again, and I may, I would keep track of the riddles posed in the first volume."
7743,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,"I originally read this book back in high school, or maybe even earlier, and find myself thinking about it sometimes, so I re-read it. One of the things that stuck with me then is that I didn't ""get"" all of it, and there was still some of that in this go around. The book is obtuse; but then, that is part of Patricia McKillip's draw, that she writes differently, that her stories are not the typical. One of the most beautiful things about this book is how it describes emotion. That is the heart of t"
7744,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,"This was a re-read after many, many years. I don't think I liked it as much as I did when it first came out, probably because it isn't as polished as her later works and I've been spoiled by a lot of good fantasy writing since then. Even the author admits this is a book she wouldn't write today, and she can barely recognize herself in the person she was back then. McKillips' turn of phrase and writing style is beautiful, however, and I must remark upon how original the storyline was in its day."
7745,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,2,"This book frustrated me. It had plenty of epic moments, plot twists and reveals, but what I missed was the character development or plot build up to make me care. Another gripe was with the logic of many of the decisions that were made. There didn't seem to be much sense to what the characters did. Finally, the magic and prophecy in the book were never explained. Most books will at least give you a framework of how magic works in their universe, but after reading the trilogy I don't know how the"
7746,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,"The paragraphs are long and rambly, and often the gem is buried somewhere in the middle of them; but the story--over the three books--is well told. These forehead markings preceed a lighting-bolt and are just as dramatic and engaging--if not more so. I first read this in 9th grade, courtesy of my brother-in-law. I enjoyed the nuances of emotion and twists of story more as an adult. I wasn't expecting happily-ever-after around every corner like I did at fourteen. A good, imaginative story. Not am"
7747,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"This was a re-read for me (third time actually). But I think this was the first time I really understood what was happening. McKillip has a beautiful and lyrical style of writing, but at times it can obscure her meaning. In the tradition of epic fantasy, I maintain this trilogy is one of the best. She manages to bring a new twists to familiar tropes so that there's some level of comfort in the trajectory of the story, but never so much that you can predict what will happen next. Also, Raederle i"
7748,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"This series is one of my all time favorites. Although a little confusing at first, the series is full of complex clues that all point to a surprise ending. It is one of those rare books that only gets better with a second and third read through. Although I have read others by this author, the Riddle-Master trilogy is clearly the best by far. A must read for fantasy lover s."
7749,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"I first read this trilogy in my teens, when it was a new paperback trilogy in the local public library. I later acquired a hardcover copy of it through the science fiction book club, and spent the next two-three decades wearing it out with re-reads until it fell apart, and then finally purchased this edition of it when it was re-released. I'd have to rate Patricia McKillip as one of my all-time favourite authors; even her older writings, like this trilogy, are well worth a re-read, and her newer"
7750,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,"Overall I liked it. However, while the language she uses to write is poetic and beautiful, sometimes it was hard to get past it to read the story. Also, there are quite a few instances where the character ""realizes"" something, but the reader doesn't get in on the joke -- which is odd because we get to see inside the character's mind a lot. The second book was from a different perspective, so that threw me off, and the third one had some chapters very akin to battle scenes that I tend to skim, al"
7751,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"I have read these books a number of times over the years and have retained the deep love I had the first time I read them many years ago. I adore the hero, Morgon The Prince of Hed and was enraptured by his world and the earth magic that was so much part of it. I liked his fiancée/lover, Raderle she was a strong able woman in her own right and didn't so much journey alongside Morgon as have her own journey which finally met up with his. I loved the world building, the details, the characters, th"
7752,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"This is probably one of only a handful of longer works that I've read more than twice now. This delightful story is compelling on many levels; the pacing is outstanding, the characters have depth and you care about them, the mystery is slowly built up and revealed at an appropriate pace, and has a great deal of emotional depth that one might not suspect at first. If any title in my library deserves the moniker of ""a good read,"" this is certainly one of a handful that whole-heartedly earns such r"
7753,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,1,"This book was just to dull to finish. Well, I seriously tried to hang on, but must surrender at page 180-something. My own fault btw. The blurb on the backcover should've warned me in advance: 'It's a rare thing that Patricia McKillip has done, to write a fantasy trilogy good enough to be compared to Tolkien' - A reader's Guilde to Fantasy' So, If you had the same strugling as me to drag yourself through to the end of 'The lord of the Rings' - Then be warned, don't start on this trilogy. Otherwise,"
7754,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"Creative, well-written fantasy triology. About quests, magic, saving your land, fantastical adventures, etc... all the good stuff a great fantasy novel should have. I heisitate to recommend this to readers too young, but perhaps middle school readers who have a love of fantasy and are strong readers would be suited to this. Otherwise I probably wouldn't tackle it til at least high school. Also, McKillip is a talented author and has written many fantasy novels that are worth reading! (This one is"
7755,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,"This book was a pretty good read. Sometimes I found the writing and descriptions of what has happening to be a little vague and confusing, but I think this was intentional. The author seemed to be trying to... I think -copy- is a little strong here... but imitate Tolkein's style a little too much. I'll have to read some other books by McKillip to find out if that's really her style or not. The cover says this was a trilogy, but it didn't feel like three separate books at all - more like just thr"
7756,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,1,"I read a couple of McKilip's more recent novels and enjoyed them, so I decided to try this one after reading the reviews here. I have only read a few chapters and found it very tedious to read. The narrative is shallow and often confusing, the characters are unmemorable ... It may probably get better at some point, but I can't read through a few more chapters of boredom. I do think McKilip is a good author, and her writing has certainly developed into a more sophisticated style from her later bo"
7757,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,"This book has all three books in the trilogy. I found the first book frustrating because McKillip did not adequately explain who everyone was. By the second book though, there seemed to be more focus on the main characters, and books 2 and 3 really focused on the love between Morgon of Hed and Raederle of An, their search for themselves, and to save their realm. I liked that McKillip left the reader the lattitude to think for themselves."
7758,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,"This is a overly ambitious attempt at epic fantasy from a (then) inexperienced author. McKillip is a master at weaving tightly constructed fairy-tales, but that skill isn't on display here. If you are already a fan of McKillip, there is some lovely writing here - but I would strongly recommend new readers start with some of her other work. I love this author, but was disappointed with Riddle-Master ."
7759,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,2,"I don't know why I read this, and kept reading it. Sometimes, the writing was pretty, describing nature and magic in lush prose. Yet nothing swept me into the world McKillip was trying to build. The story seemed both flat and forced, and I didn't understand why events that she deemed important were important. I guess the only reason I kept turning the pages was that it was my bedtime read, and the minimal interest I had in the outcome helped lull me to sleep."
7760,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"Superb fantasy, following the king of a small island in his quest to answer the riddle behind a name that has been given to him. This book is all three novels in one. The first concentrates on Morgon of Hed, book 2 brings other characters to the fore, and the third wraps everything up neatly. Characters are really well drawn, the writing just seems to flow, and plenty to keep you reading through the night."
7761,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,"I read this once when I was a lot younger, and this story has always been in the back of my mind. I read it again just recently, so it was with more mature eyes that I was finally able to appreciate what made this trilogy so enduringly bewitching. The plot is very complex, as are the characters, the main of which is one of the few dynamic characters (in the literary sense) that exist in modern literature."
7762,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,"If you haven't read this book, then all I can tell you is to go out, get it, and read it. Now. Don't bother with the rest of this review, you'll thank me later. It has: Fencing. Fighting. Torture. Poison. True Love. Hate. Revenge. Giants. Hunters. Good men. Bad men. Beautifulest ladies. Snakes. Spiders. Beasts of all natures and descriptions. Pain. Death. Brave men. Coward men. Strongest men. Chases. Escapes. Lies. Truths. Passion. Miracles. For a start. It's one of the greatest love/action/revenge stories ever abridged"
7763,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,"It's amazing that I've never found time to read this book before. I have seen the movie, but it was years ago and I only really remember the one thing that everyone remembers: The real strength of this book is that is just ticks every box imaginable. It's a fairy tale, full of action, romance and revenge, and it has that timeless quality that the best fairy tales seem to carry. It was published in the 1970s but it feels like it should be a thousand years old, passed down from generation to genera"

Let me start by saying that prior to reading this book I had probably seen the movie version a dozen times or so and ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!

7768,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,"I am one of the few people in the world who does not think the book is better than the movie here. There is an undercurrent of bitterness in this book that I find off-putting. I am given to understand by a friend that those elements--i.e., the autobiographical stuff in Goldman's own persona--are actually fictional. But I found that they soured my enjoyment of the story they framed. I couldn't enjoy the writing of a writer who seemed as misanthropic and hateful as Goldman came off to me. TPB is s"

7772,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,"“Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning.” Just a glimpse of The Princess Bride to wet your appetite. Wow, I loved it! The book is about true love and adventure. It has everything, as William Goldman describes in the beginning: “Fencing. Fighting. Torture. Poison. True Love. Hate. Revenge. Giants. Hunters. Bad men. Good men. Beautifulest Ladies. Snakes. Spiders... Pain. Death. Brave men. Cowardly men. Strongest men. Chases. Escapes. Lies. Truths. P"
7773,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,2,"I know there are people who LOOOOOOOVE the film, ""The Princess Bride."" While I thoroughly enjoy the movie, I think I may only LOOVE it. I mean, Inigo Montoya is FABULOUS and I really really dug Westley, and the pwiest was vewwy vewwy funny!!!! So, when someone was kind enough to lend me the book, I had relatively high expectations. Now, don't get me wrong, I wasn't disappointed in The Princess Bride , but I just wasn't thrilled or moved to laugh till I cry (which the movie sometimes can). First of"
7774,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,"I'm a little biased when it comes to this book. Yes, I saw the movie first and it made me happier than anything I've ever seen before or since. Yes, I do consider how much a person likes The Princess Bride before determining how good a friend to be with them. (I don't insist on it, but it can queer a good friendship) I'm not alone in this, but I do share a similar affinity for the book, despite discrepancies that may make others blanche. And even for me Fezzik will always be a Frenchman and not a"
7775,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,"I feel the need to gush. I've set aside the many books I want to read for the moment in favor of rereading this one. I loved it when I read it way back in about the sixth grade, so I thought it was time I give it another shot. As much as I loved it as a kid, I love it more now. Maybe because I can appreciate it on different levels. I'm only about halfway through on my reread, but I've come to the conclusion that Goldman is a genius. The story, characters, and dialogue are impressive enough, but t"
7776,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,"Long before the movie existed, I stumbled across this book in my college bookstore. This cover spoke to my YA fairy-tale-loving heart: So I bought it, without knowing a thing about the story. And the book was NOT what I was expecting. It was way, WAY better. If you love the movie, read the book ... and don't let yourself get bogged down in the long, offbeat intro. (Skim it if you need to.) You'll get a lot of background history on the various characters, which can be extremely funny, and a little"

7778,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,"I consider ""The Princess Bride"" as one of my all-time favorite films. I think I was about 11 when I first saw the movie and a score or more later, the love of Buttercup and Wesley still brings warmth to my heart. Besides this, how could I forget Inigo Montoya? Mandy Patinkin immortalized this character with his delivery of the famous line, ""My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father... Prepare to die!"" Sigh! I think the book is almost as good. Rarely do I favor the movie version over a book b"

With that in mind I was hyped to read The Princess Bride and not ready at all for the experience.

Swimming was impossible, the water buoyed you up, rejected you even so that body parts were impossible to keep"
7784,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,"What a charming read. This is one of the few books where I saw the movie first then read the book. I think William Goldman's book was largely ""unknown"" until the movie came out. Like Shawshank Redepmtion and Stand by Me (Based on the novella The Body) this is one of the most accurate book to screen apdaptations. It is almost verbatium from the book and the few variations (Zoo of Death rather than Pit of Despair) have no real impact on the story. Being as I edit fantasy (visa-vie my husband's books"

I did enjoy it on the whole, but I found my mind straying quite a bit thanks to a lot of ""device"" and not enough story.

As I read, I just pictured Robin Wright, Cary Elwes, Mandy Patikin, et al. as the characters. I even heard their voices in the dialog.

But then I reread it and it was awesome in an entirely new way. I'm still not a huge fan of the fake little tidbits that the ""abridgment"" offers, especially the allusions to Florin as a real place, but I generally just skip over those.

A humble farm boy training to marry the girl of his dreams. A son who lost his father. An outcast who wants a family. A jerk prince. They have been done and done again. However, the Princes Bride gives those tropes a twist. What I love about this book is that the twist isn't some kind of satirical statement of society. It might be, but that's not the whole point.

The way it was written was difficult for me to keep interested, the book dragged in parts, and I skimmed through some of it. It seemed to take forever to get to the end. I wish their were not so many long interruptions and the extra long introduction to him and his credentials... I just wanted the story, which was very entertaining. 3.4 stars"
7798,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,"I am currently writing this review, having stayed up all night with the beginnings of a cold, and being sick from something I ate yesterday. Unfortunately, I live on my own and both my male grandparents are no longer with us, so I didn't get to sit up in bed and listen to S. Morgenstern's classic tale of true love and high adventure – the 'good parts' version – being narrated by my grandfather, like the kid in the movie. Also, my dad is generally too busy, so that cuts William Goldman's own accou"
7799,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,Buddy Read with the amazing Jessica This is one of the few instances where I'm going to say that I liked the movie better. It is one of my favorite movies of all time and so the book had a lot stacked against it. I'm not sure how to rate this. I liked the actual story of the princess bride but this is my first abridged book so I wasn't really expecting so much in the story to be cut or comments inserted by the author. Plus there are some things he took out and he explains why but I think I would h

And once again: it's been ages since I read this. So very long. So – many thanks to the #GeekGirls Book Club ( also here )for making this the December book – it might have been another age before I got around to it again. I remember the sheer and utter delight of reading something that hadn't been butchered in the film version – which has, of course, much to do with the fac"

Morgenstern wasn't even real? I haven't watched the movie; I had only heard of the book in passing before this day. I had never read its blurb, never read any spoilers on any website, never even read any reviews. Therefore, I went into this book with no clue what I was getting into. For those who haven't read this book, allow me to explain myself: the author, William"
7802,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,"From the onset, I knew this would be, for me, a battle between PBtM and PBtB (Princess Bride the Movie & Princess Bride the Book). And in the beginning, it was. About halfway through, though, I forgot about making comparisons (until this review, at least) and just began to enjoy the tale. Goldman is a master storyteller and even his asides keep you interested in the progression of the story. Now, if you think you're going to sit down with this lovely little book and read the enchanting and th"
7804,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,"This book in its entirety would not have gotten 5 stars. However, I'm just judging the actual story of The Princess Bride , not all of Goldman's weird intros and ramblings about trying to get his abridgment going. Next time I read the book, I'll be sure to skip those parts, which were quite boring and became tedious. I love the whole story of Buttercup and Westley, Inigo and Fezzik, and their crazy adventures. I also love the movie!"
7805,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,"When I was a little kid I hated this book and its film adaptation, but I think I was just too young to fully understand it. Reading it again recently, I've really come to love it, with its imaginative story, vivid vocabulary, scenery described so realistically you can envision it in your mind and a vibrant, loveable cast of characters. And reading it also got me to purchase an old copy of William Goldman's Magic , a book that has become a favorite of mine as well. The Princess Bride is a little d"
7806,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,"This was such a fun read! When I saw it described as a ""love story"" I was almost turned away, but I'm so glad I tried it anyways. I finished it a while back, but I'm just now getting here to review it. So much fun!"
7807,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,"I have been a member of this site since January 2009 (I know I am feeling pretty old these days!), and the very first book I put on my to-read list, you guessed it, was this one. So roughly five years later I have finally read it! So what is this book about? Well it depends who you ask. It’s about a tale of high adventure and true love. It’s about a girl named Buttercup and a farm boy named Westley. It’s about a Spanish fencer named Inigo Montoya and a giant named Fezzik. It’s about a blood thirs"
7808,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,This book was so exciting!! I loved the movie (having watched it only very recently) and was surprised and happy to learn that there was a book version. So I bought the book and started reading and had the very strong sense of deja vu. The book and the movie are so similar. Of course there are things in the book that do not take place in the movie but they are equally thrilling and wonderful. I was glad to be reading a story that I almost instantly fell in love with and get an in depth perspecti
7809,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,"4 STARS Yet again , another book that wasn't as good as I was anticipating it to be. Now, don't get me wrong, this is a magnificent piece of literature that everyone should read. However, it lacked in many areas - too many, in fact - that I couldn't give it anything higher than four stars. The beginning was great. I'm not going to say it was ""just okay"" or anything like that, because quite honestly, the beginning was the best part. It kept me hooked until Westley left and then everything seemed to"

It's, it's (wait for it) INCONCEIVABLE!! I love the movie and was initially concerned that the book would be a let down. But then I saw a whole host of rave reviews and figured it would be safe to dive in. It was not only safe, but as much fun as I could possibly have hoped for. It's just, just (here it comes again) INCONCEIVABLE how good this is. Now there"

7812,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,"This gets shelved under ""the movie is better"" for one reason and one reason only. And that reason is the following exchange, which takes place only in the movie: Miracle Max: ""Bye bye boys! Have fun storming the castle!"" Max's Wife: ""You think it'll work?"" Miracle Max: ""It'll take a miracle."" Both: ""BYE!"
7813,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,"What an exceptionally random read. I can see how this became a cult classic; it's smart, witty, has a great cast of memorable characters and is the perfect example of metafiction at its finest. Was I the only one who thought Goldman’s ‘introduction’ was real and there was actually a guy called Morgenstern? It was only when the author started calling his wife unfeeling and his son morbidly obese that I realised I better do a quick google and clear things up, because surely no-one would insult the"
7814,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,"You probably already know this is a pretty delightful book. Well, it's an even better audiobook, read by Rob Reiner and if you know who he is, you can hear him narrating this in your head already. So, once upon a time, my grandmother was staying with us for awhile. It may have been after my grandparents divorced and before she returned to Nebraska to help her aging mother, but I don't remember for sure. All I know is that my ZZ (that's what we called her) was living with us and I got to see her n"

It's inconceivable to even think of a person who doesn't love adventures! Buttercup, our main character, had quite the adventure. Let me tell you, the best thing about this book is the characters. They're downright funny , adorable , brave , bold and most of all memorable. I loved every single one of them, especially Fezzik. I really found him very adorable! I laughed at several tim"
7816,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,"WOW! I loved this story. This book had absolutely everything you could possibly ask for, plus it made me laugh out loud dozens of times. I do not have one negative thing to say except I cannot believe how long it took me to pick up The Princess Bride. I cannot wait to watch the movies! I give The Princess Bride 5 stars, easily."
7817,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,"I can't believe I'd never read this book before. I grew up watching the movie, and I love it, but for some reason I'd never thought about there even being a book! I have to say, after reading it, it's now one of my favorites. Here's a book that has everything: a beautiful up-and-coming princess; a swoon-worthy, bad-ass swashbuckling pirate who believes in and is willing to fight for true love; a giant; an honor-bound Spaniard with the single most awesome catch-phrase ever; R.O.U.Ss...

I wasn’t too keen on the torture (a bit of an understatement) but this is the most absurd adventure story ever, and I loved it."

This is one of the ever so rare instances where I say the book and movie are both equally amazing. The movie was perfectly cast, directed, and acted - and this book had excellent writing, wit, and character development. I loved every page of this book."
7820,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,Probably my favorite fairy tale ( well except Snow White). So much humor so much affection Dastardly deeds are trumped by the courageous And rhyming whenever you speak is actually really hard!!!
7821,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,"The ""abridgment notes"" were slightly distracting (in a way they were not in the movie), but this book was still marvelous. And if someone doesn't write Buttercup's Baby, I'm gonna lose my shit. No joke."
7822,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,"It’s incredibly hard for me to write a review for this book because I had such high expectations for it. At the same time though it was entertaining and had everything it promised: high action, revenge, miracles, and most importantly true love. I can't pinpoint exactly what it was that bothered me. What kept from loving it. At first I thought maybe it was the fact that the main characters didn't always seem to do the noble and honorable thing (sometimes I questioned if Westley and Buttercup re"

After recently reading As You Wish: Inconceivable Tales from the Making of The Princess Bride , written by Cary Elwes, I HAD to re-read The Princess Bride for the umpty-eleventh time. And I loved it as usual. But I can clearly not let this review go by without saying that while The Princess Bride is supposed to be an abridgment of the S. Morgenstern classic of the same name, the screenplay for the movie is an abridgment of thi"

7826,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,1,"Now, William Goldman has written the screenplay of one of my favorite movies (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid), and I really enjoyed Princess Bride the movie. I have a friend or two who have recommended the book to me and told me that it is SO much better than the movie. Sadly, the only reason I finished this book… was that I kept hoping it would eventually get better. I’m sorry to all of you who might be a fan of the book, but I thought that it was absolutely idiotic. The movie is pretty well-k"
7827,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,"I think I have seen the movie too many times to be able to come to the book with anything like a fair perspective. To be clear, this was on the agenda of almost every movie party I went to or held in high school. I cannot count the number of times I've watched it. It's up there with Monty Python and the Holy Grail for movies of which I can recite long sections without pause. Unfair as it may be, the movie version is my version of this story, and I was not unbiased coming to this book. Note: The r"
7828,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,"I have wavered back and forth on my feelings about this book, but have come to realize THE PRINCESS BRIDE is a modern storytelling classic just as William Goldman states on the cover of his 30th anniversary edition. It is ""A tale of true love and high adventure, pirates, princesses, giants, miracles, fencing, and a frightening assortment of wild beasts."" It is also silly, at times frustrating, but definitely an original. After I got into it, (which I admit took me 250+ pages), I couldn't help but"

I had about 100 pages left and decided to just watch the movie to find out what actually happens. Like I care. I didn't like the characters(especially Buttercup!), I didn't like plot, but I will say that I liked how William Goldman told the story. Don't listen to my review and not read the book because apparently 6 of my friends gave it 4 stars, 1 gave it 3, and 4 gave it 5. I think th"
7830,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,"Although I've seen Rob Reiner's excellent film version of The Princess Bride many times I've never read the original novel until now. Goldman's writing is sharp & amusing & his cracking dialogue shows what a great screen writer he is. There are times when the story drags a little, but it's still a really fun read. However, when I tell you that I prefer the film to the book I know exactly what you'll say....""Inconceivable!"""
7831,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,"Well... I really wanted to adore this book. And while it was super good, and nearly five stars, I had to knock a few stars for various reasons. The Good Buttercup and Westley? So wonderful. I'll admit I was a terrible bookworm and I watched the book first. BUT... I had no clue the book or the movie existed until I watched the movie, so... fair? Fair. I've noticed that most people have watched the movie and haven't read the book. A lot of people don't even know there is a book. So if you don't know"

I have seen the film of The Princess Bride too many times to count, so I can't believe it has taken me this long to get around to reading the book! - This is a story within a story. William Goldman's Grandfather used to read the tale of 'The Princess Bride' by 'S. Morgenstern' to him as a child, now an adult he decides to reread it and discovers the tale to be a lot more long winded than he recalls. He realises that as his Grandfath"
7834,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,"I'm gonna be honest here: I don't get why the film is such a cult. It's kind of... meh. And I don't get why the book has practically achieved modern classic status either, because it's good, very good, but the world is full of very good books. But here's the important part: I sank completely into the classic adventure tale atmosphere and fell for most of the characters, I laughed my ass off and am most probably going to reread this quite soon. I loved it, basically. Buttercup's Baby frustrated me"

7836,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,"Choppy, but I suspect it was meant as such, considering it was written as mostly a screenplay and edited by a writer (If you can call him that) who had no concern whatsoever in preserving the sanctity of the original author's intent. A cut here, a slash there, S. Morgenstern's Classic Tale is ripped to pieces under William Goldman's butchering knife. He justifies it by the fact that he leaves a few chapters untouched, yet can't help but interject his unwanted thoughts upon his poor unsuspecting"

The intros were fun, the story amazing, the excerpt at the end fantastic, and a taste of the sequel even better!!! I will attempt a short review some time in the near future. Just know I loved it, and this is definitely a must read!!!! Actual rating: 4.5 stars. No spoilers!! Review: What to say about this book...?! Wow!!! What a story!!!

7838,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,"It's sacrilegious, I suppose, but I liked the movie better than the book. Hey - it's a classic! Besides, the movie was crafted by William Goldman, who wrote the novel. Similar to the film, the conceit of this novel is that it's a book within a book. Never one to know when to end a joke, William Goldman goes so far as to write a forward to The Princess Bride: S. Morgenstern's Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure: the Good Parts Version. (There is also an excerpt from a fake sequel). Just"
7839,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,"I enjoyed reading this, but probably not as much as if I'd read it without seeing the movie first even though it was some years ago. I liked the satirical take on the swashbuckling man in black, the master Swordsman Inigo, the strong man Fezzik, the evil prince Humperdink and the beautiful bride Buttercup and the adventures that ensued. There are some wonderful inventions - the Cliffs of Innsanity, the Zoo of Death and the Resurrection Pill. I also enjoyed Goldman's device of pretending to abrid"
7840,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,"I will forever and always love both this novel AND the movie! Also, I blame Westley for every unrealistic expectation I have for men and romance.... because this..... This man...... *drools*"
7841,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,"This is a book where I enjoyed the first half and then it fell flat for me. I truly think the movie cleaned up a lot of the messy, disjointed flow of this book. The dialogue and wry observations were my favorite parts of the book. Yet, overall, I know I won't ever reread this. It became more of an effort to finish it than to read it. Which is so odd for me because I raced through the first half and enjoyed it."
7842,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,"The Princess Bride will never show up on any Pulitzer or Booker list but if it's high adventure, romance and laughs you're after, the search ends here. I just whipped through this one and it was one of the most fun easy reads I've had in a while. Indulge yourself! This is a perfect beach novel with a unique approach by the author."

7848,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,1,"I did not like this book. It was EXTREMELY discrimintaing in my opinion, and I don't think it teaches good values to people who read it. It made me just mad, especially because it bashed- A. Who I am. B. What I want to become, and what I love. It was very just wrong how discriminating he was against women. He made sure we all understood just how stupid women are, and that they can't do anything themselves. Also, according to him, we're all unloyal, backstabing prats, who are flippant, and immature"

The film is a thing unto itself and enchanting on its own terms, but because it's a movie Goldman had to redesign his novel in a way that de-emphasized one of its most compelling themes: why books matter, what we learn from them about life and about being human, and why certain books stay with us in the way that they do -- why, in fact, we are all on this website. Most of this takes"

Once I got into the story, it was fun, though I never really cared for the interlude/author parts or the introduction. I get what William Goldman was trying to do but I just wanted the actual story, rather than his dry and jarring interruptions.

7854,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,"The Princess Bride is one of my all-time favorite films, and the book is an utter delight to read: hilarious, quick-paced and un-put-downable. The film is as faithful a representation of the book as there has ever been (William Goldman wrote both), so you'll replay the film in your head as you read, but it's fun to see where the two stories differ ever so slightly. Prince Humperdink was one of the most changed characters, and is much more of a threat in the novel. Goldman is clearly having so mu"

I’m a fearful reader at times. I’m afraid to reread a beloved book and have my opinion change. I’m afraid to read a book if I really loved the movie for fear I will see the movie differently.

To start, the first 40 plus pages in nothing but an introduction and the authors first chapter, which has to cover how he got into the story, how he liked sports, how he became an author, and movie writer..blah blah blah. Chapter one should not be your autobiography! So, 40 some odd pages later, I get to the bottom line. Mr Goldman di"

7865,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,"4.5 One tip before you read the book: Don't read the introductions. Seriously. Just don't. I was stupid enough to read the 30th and 25th anniversary introductions and I regret it. That's, like, 50 pages of stuff most of us already know. I mean, honestly. Most people know about the debacle with the Morgenstern estate, so you don't really have to read it. The only introduction I suggest is the original one that came with the book. It'll explain all you need to know. It may sound stupid not to, but if"
7866,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,Warning: Any forthcoming review is resultant from necessary tidying of read and as of yet not reviewed books. Basically this is every bit as good as the film. I suspect that the brilliance of the film may have altered some perspectives of this as a work of fiction but the book was the original.

The movie is outdated, sometimes silly (and not good silly), and again, not ""masterpiece"" hilarious. I read the book this year and, AHA, now I get it. Now I get all the jokes, all the pun, all the satire of it.

7868,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,"The Princess Bride became one of my favorite movies when I rewatched it as an adult (as a kid, I kind of hated it). But I wasn’t aware it was based on a book until I saw it at the bookshop. Obviously, I didn’t think twice before grabbing it. And despite my high expectations in the book, it didn’t disappointed me at all. The story flows, in fact, I read it only in two sittings and in the second one, I refused to let my eyes close until I was finished. This is a very enjoyable novel, both for kids"
7869,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,"What can I say that has not already been said? It is INCONCEIVABLE that I would be able to lavish it with more praise than it deserves, truly. This book is a masterpiece of satire, an adventure filled with lovable characters, a 'story within a story' done to perfection; and because of this 'hot fairy tale' from the '70s, the world was gifted with one of the best movies of the '80s- nay, one of the best movies, period. Amazing. If you like great writing and laughter, then you must read this. (And"
7871,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,"Let me make it clear from the start that S. Morgenstern is a fictitious character created by William Goldman. I was confused about that at first because Goldman (the narrator) acts as if Morgenstern were real. In this 30th anniversary edition of the book, he even details his hassel from being sued by the Morgenstern Estate, so I just had to check it out. I would give the original version of this book (the 1973 one) four stars because it has just one introduction and the story of The Princess Brid"
7873,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,"5/5 One of my favorite books 0f all time, and I'm so pleased to see I still rank it so highly. Goldman uses such brilliant- BRILLIANT- devices to tell this story, such that I've never seen before. Not only does he assume the identify of the Morgenstern pseudonym to create dynamics within the storytelling, but he also creates an entirely fictitious autobiographical account, and frequently peppers the Bride storyline with those personal accounts, adding contemporary humor alongside the traditional"

I loved the story inside story of the book. Goldman writes it in such an excellent way that at a point, you're no longer sure if everything is fiction. I mean, I knew such a book couldn't really exist but the way he wrote it made me hesitate and wonder; ""maybe it did? Maybe it IS real?"" Which I think is where the greatness of this story lies. Besides, the"

I don’t think I’ve seen the movie either, although it’s possible I saw it when I was very young and just don’t remember it. A few of the lines in the book were familiar, but that may just be because I’ve heard people quote from the movie over the years. I really enjoyed this although I think, maybe a little oddly, I enjoyed the framing story the best. I did enjo"
7878,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,"Conceivably the best swashbuckling, action, fantasy, adventure, love story ever abridged. Boy, does it have it all, apart from the boring bits which William Goldman has expertly cut, possibly using only his left hand. Inconceivably, despite his insistence there is an original longer version, including the boring bits, by an author named S. Morgenstern, this too is part of the fiction. Which makes it a dastardly clever book, as well as highly entertaining."

My relationship with it is long and complicated. When I was in eighth grade, I spent a lot of time in the theater department. My drama teacher had a little bookshelf in his office, and one of the books was this battered old paperback copy of The Princess Bride . I used to pick it up now and then and read the introduction. Just the introduction. Something about Goldman's frame stor"
7882,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,2,"“Life isn't fair, it's just fairer than death, that's all.” I want a real abridged version. This book tested my patience - I loathed the author butting in all the time. It was just awful. Now I am not saying this book is awful; it has its merits and gripping moments. But never will I read this book again without a pen in hand to cross out all Goldman or Morgenstern has to say about it. I mean, what is this? The author, Goldman, tells the history of his fictional self who reads a book by (fiction"
7883,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,"I must confess that my memory of the movie and the book have blended into one. The best way I can think of to described my feelings about this story is warm affection and good humour. There are lines of dialogue from this story that have become a part of our family ""language"" and quotes sneak into our speech at unexpected times (you are warned!). Nothing is ever unthinkable, or improbable, but it is inconceivable all the time. Vizzini: HE DIDN'T FALL? INCONCEIVABLE. Inigo Montoya: You keep using tha"
7884,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,"I didn't set a high expectation for this book as I've never even heard of William Goldman, let alone read any of his works before. However, upon finishing The Princess Bride, I felt glad that I DID buy it as I think that it would be such a shame to miss a story as good as this. If you read this book solely for the true love concept that is supposed to be one of the themes of the book, you'll probably be quite dissappointed. I'm not saying that there's no romance at all in there. True, there is a"

THERE IS NO S. MORGENSTERN, NO MRS. MORGENSTERN, NO ""BEAUTIFUL SHRINK WIFE, HELEN"", NO SON, BUT RATHER TWO DAUGHTERS AND AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT WOMAN. WHAT?!?!

7887,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,"3.5 out of 5 MY boyfriend made me watch this movie a few years ago, telling me it was awesome and one of his favourites. I kind of doubted him because I thought he only loved it because he had watched it when he was young. I would be watching it for the first time at eighteen and thought some of the childlike whimsy would be lost on me. I was wrong. I loved the movie. I have watched it many times since then. I quote it on the regular. It's a great movie. I knew it had been a book first but I had"
7888,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,1,"I can't honestly put into words how much of a disappointment this turned out to be. The Princess Bride is easily my favourite film of all time - I actually know all the lines to it. I was expecting to love this as much as I do the film. This book is soooo infuriating. It takes about 50 pages of unnecessary explanations to actually get into the story. That is 50 pages of boring talk about a boring author and his boring life, that in the end, has almost no contribute to the story and could have been"
7890,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,"This review will be filled with confessions. The first one is that the first time I read this book (about 15 years ago) I really thought it was recounting actual events in the author's life. I thought there was an S. Morganstern and a place called Guilder and Florin. At least I hoped there was. I grew up watching the movie and when I realized that the film was based on a book, I knew that I had to read it. I've come back to it a couple of time since then and it never disapoints me. I confess thoug"
7891,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,"The Princess Bride is obviously a great classic tale, so I wasn’t sure what to expect reading the book when I’ve seen the movie many times. What I found was that I was basically watching the movie in my head, as scenes and lines were often identical. The excellent, witty dialogues that are so memorable are undeniably the best parts of the book, and I enjoyed them very much as the movie was reeling in my head. I found the parts that were left out of the movie boring and I ended up skimming those a"
7892,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,"I've always been an advocate of reading the book first, but when the movie came out in 1987, I was six and had no idea it was based on a book (and shame on my Dad for not finding it and reading it to me). I loved the movie, and my familiarity with it (having watched it dozens of times) did not dampen my love for the book one bit. The movie is one of the most faithful adaptations of a book I have ever read. Most of it is lifted directly from the book, which is wonderful, and I wish could be said"
7893,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,"""The Princess Bride"" is about a multitude of characters that include Buttercup, the princess bride who is the most beautiful woman in the world, Westley, the farm boy who becomes the most heroic man in the world, Inigo, the Spaniard who seeks revenge, and Fizzik, the gentle giant. There is a lot of different things in the plot, and some of which are true love, fencing, fighting, revenge, torture, passion, and a lot more that I can't name.

7897,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,1,"I wouldn’t be surprised if devout fans of this book (and movie) hiss at my unfavorable review of The Princess Bride: S. Morgenstern’s Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure by William Goldman. I just can’t do it. I bought this book long before I’d seen the movie, but after I’d seen the movie (and disliked it) I didn’t have high hopes for enjoying this book. My friends (and some acquaintances) could not believe I’d escaped the 80s without having seen this movie. I don’t know what to tell th"
7898,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,"Well. THAT was different. I've seen the movie version but only once and probably about 25 years ago. Lots of it I remember; lots of it, not so much. Reading this, I took a while to catch onto the fact that this author also wrote the movie screenplay and there IS no S. Morgenstern or Original Classic Tale that has been abridged. Once I caught on, it added an extra dimension to my reading enjoyment. Sort of like being in on an inside joke. The wacky Jewish humor, the impossible cliche-ridden turns"
7899,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,"Yep, I finally read it. And just like the movie -- I loved it. But it lost a star because I didn't care for the part before the story started and after it ended. I swear that makes sense! I didn't like Buttercup's Baby at the end. Quite torturous for me to read. But other than that, I loved it. Ps: while I was reading this I also read the graphic novel Andre the Giant: Closer to Heaven . Really enjoyed it."
7901,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,"This was a LOT of fun. It was short, full of action, & very well narrated. I've never read the original & feel no need. I've never managed to see the entire movie (no need or desire) but my daughter & others babble about it all the time. Now I get some of the jokes."
7902,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,"I grew up watching this movie and absolutely love it. I thought it was about time to read it. I am not sure if I am biased towards the movie but I did find myself wishing I was watching the movie instead of reading the book! Loved learning a little more about the characters and the story line. I still liked the book, but LOVE the movie"
7903,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,"Sorry, everybody. I know, I'm a disappointment. It's not that I can't see why people are in love with this book. I might have been myself, if I'd read it when I was 12, and if I hadn't already read Pratchett (who does similar things but much better), and a bunch of other authors whose prose style and humour Goldman is unsuccesfully aping. Or if I'd seen the film as a child and was projecting the film's colour and liveliness onto the novel. Unfortunately, I'm not 12, and I'd sort of like things lik"

I may have to turn in my geek card for admitting this, but I'm just going to come clean. I've seen approximately half of the movie, and I didn't even know there was a book. And to be honest.. When I found out there was a book I never planned to read it. I don't even know why I decided to pick it up now, I just had a random urge to read it, so I went with it. A"
7905,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,"Definitely a fun story, but it's incredibly dated and I don't really like how Buttercup is treated. Witty and smart and engaging, otherwise."
7906,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,"3.5 stars This book deserves some attention! I found it so hilarious I cannot understand why I did not read it before. The book combines elements of comedy, adventure, fantasy, romantic love, romance and fairy tale, and is presented as an abridgment (or ""the good parts version"") of a longer work by S. Morgenstern. Apparently Goldman presented it as a gift to his son after remembering the huge importance it had in his own life, ever since his father read it to him at his sickbed. But his son did n"
7907,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,2,"I didn't like this book. The introduction in which the author describes the publication of the book and how it garnered interest enough to become a film was extremely grating to my nerves. I couldn't stand the author's voice and by the time I realised that what I was reading was in fact an introduction to the book, I had lost interest and didn't bother reading further for a few months. I have since returned to the book and went to the first chapter without bothering to read the ridiculous introdu"
7910,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,"It's a great book. Gives a lot of fun back story to the already awesome characters you met in the movie. I would highly recommend watching the movie first, and then reading the book. William Goldman goes into detail in the 30th anniversary printing of how he had a few actors in mind for a long time before the movie was made, specifically Andre the Giant. Goldman also makes it clear that the other actors where all great choices too. Goldman also does a great job of blending reality with fiction."
7911,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,1,"Short version : I abhor this book. If I had read it before the movie came out, I never would have bought a ticket. Long version : Let me tell you why, with apologies to D.P. Roberts: Seriously, how can I be the only person who didn't love this book?!? I ADORE the film, so expected to at least like the book. But the clever dialogue delivered by the talented actors in the movie with such vim and dread piratey vigor did NOT come across on the page for me, and the interminable author asides (fabricated"
7912,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,Contrary to normal trends the movie was much better than the book. I know Goldman thought his interruptions and asides were funny but really I found them boring and they slowed the book down. The movie without these parts was much better. The actual novel itself is your fairly typical fairytale romance though a tad more violent and pretty sexist in some of the actions and comments. All-in-all there was nothing really new to the story and I'd say if you've seen the movie don't bother with the boo
7913,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,"I enjoyed this book but it was a little overhyped. I liked the concept of it in theory, but the parts where Goldman goes on about his publishing troubles I was ready to keel over from boredom. It would probably have been a better book without the added layer of him pretend-abridging a nonexisting book, because the fairytale portion of it would have definitely gotten a higher rating from me! It was predictable but funny and most of the characters (Fezzik! <3) just SO loveable. I wanted a better"
7914,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,"Sometimes you just want to pick up a book that will make you laugh out loud and will bring back childhood memories. Learning to read, finding a great fairy tale, and being drawn in by adventure. This book has it all - a princess, a hero, a jerky prince, love, adventure, a giant, pirates, a man with six fingers, torture, and loads of laughter. Love it mucho!!!"
7915,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,"Loved it. Utterly charming, and it must be the most quotable book of all time. 'Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.' And that is just the tip of the iceberg. It is brilliant - think I smiled the whole way through reading this."
7916,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,"This is such a fun, creative book. This is one of those rare instances where I loved both the book and the movie equally because they work so well as the medium they are and, of course, the story has it all--romance, adventure, bad guys, twists and turns. Did I mention romance? So good."
7917,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,"Everyone - EVERYONE - knows the movie version, and it's a classic. Turns out it's a masterful adaptation of an equally classic short novel. Goldman is a hilarious, clever, dark writer. It is everything you saw in the film with a smattering of hilarious description and background. Loved it."
7918,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,ha ha ha! I love this story. I can watch the movie over and over! It never gets old for me. This was my first time listening to the audio book version and it was almost as good as the movie.
7919,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,"Still sooooo goooood!!! Westley, Inigo, Fezzik!! Such a classic! My only bone to pick with Mr. Goldman is Buttercup. Buttercup is not... the best... written female character ever. She's just: bleh. BUT! Westley, Inigo, Fezzik!!!! THEY ARE AMAAAZING!"
7920,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,There are no words. I'm in love.
7921,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,I possess the wherewithall to assert that this book is even better than the movie. I laughed out loud many times. I love his writing style.
7923,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,One of the best books i have ever read. Truly a classic.
7925,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,"I wanted so badly to like this book more than I did. I mean, The Princess Bride is supposed to have everything – pirates, giants, swashbuckling, romance, yadda yadda. The movie is great. And indeed, the book does have its moments – a whole stretch of them to be honest. Unfortunately, that stretch was broken up by William Goldman's insufferable interruptions. I mean, sure, it's a clever conceit, that Goldman has discovered and abridged a classic Florinese adventure tale. But the point of abridgem"
7926,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,"I loved this! Such a fun satirical fairy tale. This is meta as helllll. It's about Goldman's quest to abridge the famous fake book The Princess Bride by the famous but fake author S. Morgenstern, followed by his abridgement of the book to include just the ""good parts."" The parts of this book from a fictionalized version of Goldman (at least I hope it's fictionalized...) were funny, but at times tedious. ""Goldman"" in this book is an asshole. An entitled asshole. So while the initial narrative abou"

7928,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,"I have no idea what took me so long to read this modern-day classic. Yes, I had seen and enjoyed the film a couple of times over the years, but the book really sings and even made me appreciate the film more. If you have not read the book yet, get off your duff and give it a shot and then see the film again. You can save your many thanks for later."

7932,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,"The Princess Bride is one of my favourite movies. But I resisted watching it when it first came out. I thought the title was dumb (still do, actually) and hadn't heard or seen anything about it that really piqued my interest. My best friend, knowing my interests and convinced I'd like the movie if I tried it, invited me over for some other reason and had the video waiting for me. So I watched. And I liked it, aside from thinking Buttercup was too mean to Westley on the farm. My friend thought I'"

But just after them realising their true feelings for one another, Westley sailed off to America to seek his fortune, in order to become a man worthy of Buttercup. Buttercup waited and waited, but news came one day that Westley’s sh"
7936,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,"“ This is my favorite book in all the world, though I have never read it. ” I love everything about this book. I admire Goldman's intricate framework, that enables him to position his own book as an old classic, to hide a story within a story, and to fill the pages with lovely bits of metafiction. As a reader, you're constantly reminded that you are in fact reading. Goldman draws attention to the reading experience itself in a way that is both elegant and humorous. The inner story is not only a fan"
7937,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,1,"To start out, I am fully aware that most people love this book and give it raving reviews. And I am ok with that. I don't think you are dumb for liking this book. I am also fully aware that my taste in books not like anyone else's taste in books that I have ever met....so with that in mind, my review: I saw the movie several years before I read the book. I was an adult. I did not like the movie, at all. So I probably shouldn't have bothered with the book in the first place. But my husband loved i"

I've always enjoyed the movie and I happened to notice the other day, how many of my GR friends had given this book such high marks. So I gave it a try and this has turned into one of my favorite books. There is so much depth here to this plot and characters. I would put the character development as equal to or maybe even a little better than Joe Abercrombie. (At least equal too). You have to hang with the plot but you begin to see how it comes together to paint"

The were two full introductions (about 70 pages) before ya even got to the story, but what a story. It has so much of what made the movie great, plus a little more depth to the characters or the reasons why certain things happened. I do think that the idea of the Grandfather telling the story to his child works better than the story being interrupted by the author, but it all works and"
7940,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,"My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die... I remember watching this movie when I was younger and really loved it. It was a more sarcastic take on the classic ""happy ending"" fairy tale. I was excited to read the book as it was selected for a book club pick this month. I absolutely loved the book, and can't wait to go back to watch the movie again. The characters were lifelike, flaws and all. I love the magical aspect, Fezzik, death, Cliffs of Insanity, and the Zoo of death."
7941,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,2,"Ugh. I wanted to love this book and I thought I would since the movie is one of my favorites...I was wrong. The book is almost identical to the movie with only a few slight differences. However, the few differences ruined the book for me. Mainly, Buttercup was entirely unlikable in this scenario. She was beautiful but brainless, naive, selfish, and at times heartless. The ending was also different but way worse, and super disappointing. Fezzic and Inugo were still their adorable lovely selves, t"
7942,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,"Wonderful book. At first I have to admit I felt a bit cheated by the title, it being ""The Princess Bride - The Classic Tale of TRUE LOVE and High Adventure"", because, to me, there was a whole lot more of high adventure than actual true love, but still, what a great, addictive, and absolutely fun read! William Goldman's writing is simple, objective, and terribly smart, fast-paced, funny, sarcastic and romantic (at the right parts, like in the beginning, with Westley and Buttercup, before he leaves"
7943,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,"Well. I'll echo what so many other reviewers have said-- this book has everything. I would have wanted perhaps a little less of the author's backstory(especially considering most of it was probably fiction) and some of the narrative was just bizarre( Zoo of Death? ), but overall the sweet romance, the humor, the nostalgia, and the epic-ness of it all won me over. :) Content: Some instances of language or misuse of God's name; some innuendo; questionable narrative during the author's introduction.

I'm glad the film followed so closely to the book. I really enjoyed reading this! The only parts that bothered me while reading were when the author kept referring back to ""Morgenstern's version"". I thought those parts were unnecessary and distracted from the wonderful story! But, honestly, the story was so lovely, I'm overlooking that and still giving it 5 st"
7945,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,"I can't believe I managed to go over 24 years without reading the book OR seeing the movie! I am so glad I finally have because, damn, I loved it. I enjoyed every part and I loved the unique style of writing - pretending (probably not the right word but the only one that's coming to mind right now) to be abridging someone else's book with notes from the 'abridger' added in. Interesting, effective and funny. Forcing my boyfriend to watch the movie with me this weekend..."
7946,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,"I'll admit, I didn't read this book until after I saw the movie (yes, I saw it in the movie theatre when it first came out), but I have read it multiple times since then. Not only is the story wonderful, but the whole metafictional conceit sets it apart from typical adventure/romance novels. A favorite."
7947,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,"I just loved this book. Part of it probably had to do with my love for the movie, but it was also genuinely delightful. Goldman is hilarious and I’ve never read another book like his, with the fictitious abridgment and his clever Interjections."
7948,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,
7949,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,"Despite having seen the film countless times, this is still a joy to read and I would definitely recommend it to fans of the film, fans of adventure stories and even those looking for a good chuckle."
7950,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,I can't believe I forgot about this book and how much I loved it!
7951,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,One of my new all-time favorite books ever.
7952,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,"Ruined ever so slightly by the ending, but highly recommended nonetheless. Absolutely hilarious and charming, and definitely my favourite book of the year!"
7954,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,2,"Let me start with saying that I really, really REALLY LOVE the movie. I was so excited when my friend told me that there is actually a book. I couldn't wait to read it. Just imagine the scene: Eeva sitting on her sofa. On the left - her fave mug with tea. On the right - a white blanket, thrown casually on her feet. The room is quiet and the air is full of anticipation. She starts to read. She makes it through painfully long beginning which feels like walk thorugh hell for her. She makes it to the f"

7958,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,"I don't like Buttercup. I was about 12 when I saw this movie for the first time and even then I thought Buttercup was an idiot. It started when she flung herself down a mountain. First she pushed Westley, which was cool because he was being a butt. But then instead of trying to run down the hill or carefully sit on her bottom and scoot (my favorite method) she jumps like a wackadoodle. Idiot. Then they got to the Fire Swamp. Have you ever seen anyone more useless? Westley is getting his face che"

One day, Buttercup realizes she is in love with Westley. Westley immediately leaves for the Americas, to make his fortune and return to wed Buttercup. But the Dread Pirate Roberts attacks his ship and leaves no survivors. The most beautiful woman in the world is then wooed by Prince Humperdink, is captured by a Sicilian, a giant, and a Spaniard, and is chased by a dread"
7960,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,"Most everyone is familiar with the movie of the same name. Why not venture back to the original source and see how much better the book is? The style of Goldman's writing really brings forth mirth and humor. However, I cannot fully describe how without revealing too much of the novel's inner workings. So no spoilers from me. I'd encourage you to pick up the book, avoid reading reviews that will give away too much and get to it! I will say that many of the lines from the movie are taken directly fr"
7961,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,"I have always loved the Princess Bride. I watched the movie a couple years ago and fell in love with it. Yes, it was kind of cheesy. But I laughed and laughed and fell in love with the characters. I hadn't really known there was a book, but the second I found out there was, I bought it. The story of the Princess Bride is told in a ""story within a story"" format. There is the story of the author's ""experience"" of first being read this book, originally by an S. Morgenstern, by his dad. The story wit"
7962,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,"*looks at the many 4 and 5 star reviews* *whispers* The movie was better.... But I suppose that isn't quite fair to the book. You see, the movie is basically the book and the book is basically the movie. The dialogue and plot are almost identical. I grew up on the movie, so I am biased towards it. What I especially prefer about the movie, however, is that it cuts out a lot of Goldman's voice. Don't get me wrong. The book is genius for its originality. It is really clever how he pretends to be 'abri"

I am a huge fan of the cult film, “The Princess Bride” and so have wanted to read the book for years. I finally found a copy in my local charity shop and so decided I would give it a go, here are my thoughts.

I'm probably the last person on earth who hadn't read it. I've never seen the movie either. Yes, I live under a rock. It's a detriment to me. I know. This book is hilarious. The humor is so dry, so tongue-in-cheek, that it tickles my particular funny bone particularly well. I'll also admit that the action/adventure parts of the story had my heart thumping pretty good.

But when Westley is killed whilst at sea"
7966,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,"Read this for the first time since back when I was 12 or so. Unsurprisingly, my impressions and memories are largely shaped by the absolute masterpiece of a movie. Two things stood out to me that I don't think I appreciated when I first read it. First, just how cynical and/or downright depressing the book version of this is. The opening sequence, where Goldman is in California working on a movie, considering allowing himself to be seduced by a starlet who wants a part, reflecting on his loveless m"
7967,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,"As I read The Princess Bride aloud to our family, I was delighted to learn how Mr. Goldman’s father once told him this story out loud. And when he tried to get his own son to read it years later, and his son said it was boring, he learned that his father had cut out all the boring parts. And so Mr. Goldman set to work at once writing this lovely abridged version of S. Morgenstern’s classic. Yeah … I fell for it. I was halfway through the book when my husband broke it to me. Then I went on Wikiped"
7968,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,"The story of Buttercup, Westley, et al., is pretty classic. And the basic frame story of this being an abridgment of a much longer novel that was precious to the author's childhood, is pretty cute. Too bad so much real estate in the book is taken up by the semi-fictional yammerings of the author concerning: a) what a diamond-bright fucking genius he is for having written -ahem- ABRIDGED it, b) how much he hates his wife for being a shrew and his son for being fat (don't worry, the kid eventually"
7969,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,"from NPR survey of great Young Adult fiction. I love the movie (LOVE!!!! major quote source!!!) so I'm kind of afraid to read the book. Will it conflict with the movie, or will it enhance? ***** My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die! This book was a delight! The movie was very loyal to the book, so most of your favorite dialogue is here (notable exception: "" to blathe! "" - in fact, Carol Kane's character is no where to be found).

Suffering drives us to achieve great things.” I’ve postponed starting Best Served Cold, the first book in Abercrombie’s First Law stand-alone trilogy, for almost a year now due to the reason that I thought it will pale in comparison to the first trilogy, although it’s the weakest so far, it’s still so much better than a lot of grimdark books out th"

It follows Monza as she is betrayed very badly and then plots her course to get revenge on all those present at the time of the betrayal. Set in the same world as the great First Law trilogy, the back drop is the region of Styria. Springtime in Styria. And that means war. Springtime in Styria. And that means revenge.

Now the review: Continuation after First Law Trilogy, telling about epic bloody revenge story. Compared with the trilogy, this novel has significantly lower magical content.

7978,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,"It was good but it wasn't great like the trilogy. The character interactions were what made the book. The plot was lacking and his writing style has never been smooth. It entertaining from an action point of view and you don't have to wait for it. From the prologue on it's battle, guts and assassinations. A killing smorgasbord."
7979,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,I love these books especially listening to them on audio. The narrator is just excellent and there is a little soundtrack with slashing swords which really sets the scene. The only problem is that I do not get to have the paper copies with the oh so beautiful covers. Best Served Cold is typical Abercrombie fare which means it is the epitome of grimdark. If you do not enjoy gritty then you will not like his books. Somebody dies unpleasantly on just about every other page and even the people who l

I doubt I have the words to explain how good the second half of this book was. Not to say the first half was bad, I mean the prologue was simply amazing. The tempo was like a ball rolling, slowly at first, then gathering momentum the farther it goes. With tension packed moments, bloody and gritty action and exceptional world building. How many tim"

Take what's left and mix in one random barbarian from Abercrombie's earlier trilogy, then pour into a pan with a good dollop of the late Middle Ages. Fry for 880 pages, dropping in one new badguy every 110. By the end of the process, it should look something like ""The Unforgiven"". . . It won't taste nearly as good, though.

And Steven Pacey has risen to the top to join my favourite audio narrators. If you are into audio books and have Abercrombie on your ""to read"" list, then treat yourself to the audio version. The narration really added that extra punch to an already hard hitting story. Best Served Cold is a fantastic addition to The First Law universe. It’s stand-alone so you don't absolutely need to"
7984,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,"Well, one of my favorite authors does not disappoint, I totally love this guy! So much violence, grit and...fun.

Set in the same world as 'The Blade Itself,' 'Best Served Cold' introduces us to Monza Murcatto, a mercenary general. It's unusual for a woman to be a mercenary, let alone a military leader - and she's achieved her place by being twice as ruthless and tough as the hard-bitten men around her. However, tough as she may be, she's not invulnerable. A shattering betrayal has ended with her dearly beloved b"

7988,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,"I didn't jump right into reading ”Best Served Cold” after finishing the author's First Law trilogy, and now I can remember why. Reading Abercrombie simply leaves me emotionally drained. I very masochistically put myself through the experience because afterwards, once I've let myself cool down, I realize it was worth it. Still, these books are not for everyone. It's not just that they're violent, gory, unpredictable, and full of frustratingly flawed characters- it's that they leave you off (or at"

Given that the First Law series is on my list of ""All Time Favorites"" I think it is safe to assume, I loved this book. In addition to creating a superb story with a tight plot and, as always with his books, unforgettable characters, Abercrombie advances in subtle but very interesting ways the larger story arc of the ""great battle"" addressed in the First Law series.

7994,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,"Verhoeven's ""Flesh + Blood"" meets ""Hang 'em High"" in the most entertaining fantasy novel since Game of Thrones. This is the fourth novel set in Joe Abercrombie's First Law world, but it isn't tied so closely to the preceding trilogy that one can't enjoy it as a stand-alone. Honestly, as good as that trilogy was, Best Served Cold eclipses it. When I was a teenager I read about Italian mercenaries in the late Middle Ages and how they fought (or pretended to fight) for the gold of families like the"

Trust me listen to the audiobook and appreciate the sweet, dark, sordid insights of this crews banter plus how great the narrator did the characters. It’s hilarious! Mercenary Cosca turned out to be my favorite character towards the end of the book. He’s a drunk, mercenary, general or soldiers but brilliant. Mercatto, she’s Ferro but more worldly and knowledgeable in many things. I’d never cross her. Shiver well he went to Steryia to be a good man, well, he found"

However, after finishing The First Law trilogy he has become like an “old favorite” that I can come back to any time and be sure of a good read.

I have 7 to go, and because of what i do, you now have 7 to go. They say revenge is best served cold, they say revenge is bittersweet.

I've recommended this book to people who haven't read The First Law, because I don't think you have to be particularly interested in Fantasy to enjoy and understand it. By enjoy and understand it, I mean lose all faith in humanity and accept that this book is what did it to you. It's not even grimdark, where you get the psychopaths murdering and raping indiscriminately, bits of"
8005,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,"I loved the trilogy that preceded this standalone book so much I wasn't sure how much I'd enjoy a book set in the same world but featuring different characters. I needn't have worried. Joe Abercrombie breathes life into all his characters so well that I soon found myself just as interested in these newbies as I was in the characters from the previous trilogy. A few familiar faces showed up, too, which was nice. This is a dark tale of vengeance with no clear heroes and no clear villains. It's actio"

Somewhere in the back of my mind, I think I knew that right away. First of all, I dove in knowing it was going to be tale of revenge, given the title and all, but I realized not long after I started the book that the story itself wasn't going to go that much farther beyond that concept. That said, it did give the book a clear direction. I may have enjoyed the story more in The Firs"

Mr. Ambercrombie has invented some of the best characters I've come across in recent fantasy work. he as a gift for placing his characters in a bloody, dirty gritty world without having to constantly point out how gritty the world is.

I'm usually hesitant to read standalone fantasies like Best Served Cold. I prefer series so I can get to know the characters over a longer time, but I was eager to revisit Abercrombie's world so I picked up Best Served Cold, and I'm glad I did.

It's Kill Bill meets Ocean's 11 in a medieval setting. Audio book: I believe this is the first audio book I've listened to narrated by Michael Page. I think he does a pretty good job.

It was supposed to be another celebrity on my bookshelf, and it is more like a still smoking caldera or a sore spot where your tooth used to be, both inconvenient and annoying.

Rest assured, I loved Best Served Cold from the first pages: the plot (killing seven powerful people in the name of revenge), the pace (you kill the main protagonist and then move forward boldly), the weird assortment o"
8012,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,"Best served cold is the first of 3 separate standalone books by Joe Abercrombie after the conclusion of The First Law trilogy. It can be read as an introduction to Abercrombie's world, however a knowledge of the characters and events of the preceding trilogy provide added depth.

8014,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,7.5/10 Abercrombie can write him some good novels! This wasn't his best that I've read but still had me hooked and I was able to plough through it even with some limited reading time! It started a little slow for me but once the gang got together to pull off a Kill Bill meets Magnificent 7 type plot I was well and truly hooked. The characters weren't great individually but together they worked well for me. This was looking like a 5 star novel about a third of the way in. I was really enjoy the plo
8015,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,"This is easily Joe Abercrombie's best book, and already my top read of 2013. Perhaps even of the last few years. The author has a certain love for broken things, and crafted some of the most memorable characters in Best Served Cold. They each have their unique voice, needs, fears, and quirks. The plot serves them, and not the other way around. On top of all this, this may be some of the cleverest writing I've read. Not just the witty dialogue, but even within the prose itself. Abercrombie has a fi"

8017,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,"""The earth holds no rewards but darkness."" If you're looking for a good one-sentence summary of the predominant philosophy undergirding Joe Abercrombie's consistently, insistently dark high fantasy, that piece of internal monologue from one of the main characters of Best Served Cold might fit the bill. Abercrombie plays with the limits of nihilism. How far can a protagonist go before you stop rooting for him (or her, in this case)? The answer, as it turns out, is quite far. How far can a protagon"

8019,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,"2.5 stars. Like many others, I picked up this book because I enjoyed (really enjoyed!) the First Law trilogy. While this book isn't bad, it is extremely disappointing compared to the trilogy. The good: 1) Several characters from the trilogy show up in this book, playing roles of various importance. Someone picking up this book with no other experience with Mr. Abercrombie's work could follow along just fine, but for those who read the trilogy, there's some joy at recognizing the old faces (and a fe"

This is a book about vengeance, revenge, and what some people will do to achieve it. But I think it was the characters that really made it. Each one of them was a truly untrustworthy person willing to stab their best friend in the back in a heartbeat. Throw five of them together and what do you get? Well, alot of death for one. Plus tons of drama and violence. I'd suggest"
8022,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,"Reread Review - July 2018 This reread confirmed a few things for me. One, this is an extremely good book - even better than the previous trilogy. It's better written, the format is essentially perfect, it's equal parts laugh-out-loud funny and terrifyingly depressing. The characters easily hold their own with those of the trilogy. It's just an utterly readable story. It also moves the overall First Law plot forward in a great way! But it's also my least favorite First Law book. Why? Well, for one,"

It is an improvement in every way compared to The First Law trilogy. And I loved the characters. I'm a fan of The Dirty Dozen types of stories, or like Mass Effect 2 for a newer reference, or even Inception. And to me that was the fun part of the book. Reading Monza building her team and how the plan fit all of them together. They all had their quir"

Not a masterpiece, just the kind of book that can be a guilty pleasure read. It`s dark, full of action and witty. Abrecrombie does a wonderful job in telling a story and this was a highly enjoyable read as were his previous works. But, it lacked in other aspects I so enjoy when reading fantasy, especially regarding the plot which is kept too simple and revolves around revenge, altho"
8025,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,"3.5 🌟🌟🌟 One cannot grow without pain. One cannot improve without it. Suffering drives us to achieve great things. This is exactly what Mr. Abecrombie delievers here: pain and suffering and torture and mutilation beyond the limits of all that's sane.

His characters will do just about everything that's wrong and eve"

In the movie, Dr. Anton Phibes revenges himself against the ten people whom he blames for his wife’s death using the plagues of Exodus as a blueprint. It’s great fun to watch, Price is at his"

Yes, basically the characters range from being shits, to being total shits. But I sort of liked that. It's a book about an ex-mercenary and the group of murderers she gathers to get revenge for a pretty horrendous wrong done to her by her ex-employer. There's no innocent farmboy who stumbles into a magical artifact, which leads him onto a noble quest where he discovers both his"
8039,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,"Revenge fantasy, and by ‘fantasy’ I mean the swords and sorce—okay, no, just the swords kind. And maces and axes and a lot of knives. This is that new millennium brand of epic fantasy, you know the kind that dropped all the nebulously old-fashioned dialogue and portentous prophecies for a lot of fucking and people calling each other cocksucker in gritty patois. It’s supposed to be more real or something. I dunno, I don’t think I identify any extra with a woman bent on killing the seven people wh"
8040,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,"Best Served Cold is a revenge story told in the world of the ""First Law"" series. Dark, gritty, raw, and sometimes ugly is this story about vengeance, a tale of relentless pursuit of murder. Many secondary characters from the first law series have roles in this novel. Joe Abercrombie holds no punches back in his descriptive prose, and he paces his stories that you often find yourself needing to catch your breath. I find myself more enamored with his writing style, his uniqueness, and his visual s"
8042,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,Another great read from Joe Abercrombie! I had no idea how this one was going to end. I can't wait to read more!
8043,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,2,"Monza Murcatto is a a successful mercenary, a little too successful as her employers begin to fear her popularity, and betray. Now she's got to get them. Seems like it should be right down my bailiwick, but I just couldn't get into it."
8044,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,"Damn, but I’d forgotten how bloody awesome this book is. Darker, bloodier and even more entertaining than Abercrombie’s First Law trilogy, Best Served Cold is the ultimate tale of revenge, a tale packed with pain, fury and absurdity from its spectacular opening sequence to its final poignant pages. The story is of course set in the world of First Law, though several years after the events of the original trilogy. Here we are introduced to the ‘exotic’ land of Styria, a fractured continent hosting"
8046,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,"When the infamous mercenary captain, Monza Murcatto, seems to be getting too powerful, her employer, Duke Orso, attempts to have her and Benna, Monza's next-in-command, killed. Short work is made of Benna, but, by a cruel twist of fate, Monza survives, just barely. And her quest for vengeance sets a spark to the powder-keg that is the country of Styria during the Years of Blood. Best Served Cold is a stand-alone novel that takes place in the same world as Joe Abercrombie's acclaimed The First Law"

I've read it four times so far, and it always stays fresh and fun. The original trilogy is a bit awkward, which is expected, the follow-up books read like Joe was forced to fulfill a contract, and the Half-a-Viking NOT-YA saga is just a repetition of The First Law trilogy. In a way, there isn't too much v"
8050,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,"This was not my favorite Abercrombie, and I have to be realistic about these things. But say one thing about Abercrombie, say he is consistent. It still contained his sense of humour, his glorious discription of bloody battles and his overal great writing style. But sadly, that was the smaller part of the book. Boy o boy was this book a slow one. Too much politics that really did not interest me at all. And the characters, which are usually unique and entertaining, felt old and used. I could not c"
8051,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,"This was my first read by author Joe Abercrombie. Fantastic! If you are looking for a well-written tale of revenge, then this is the book for you. However, this book is not for the faint of heart! Abercrombie does a great job at making ""grey"" characters. There really are no good guys and bad guys in this one, and characters feel lifelike as they progress through the book. As a quick side note: it's nice to see a great standalone fantasy book in todays market which seems to cater to long series"
8052,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,"Revenge. Incest. Magic. Politics. Lots of battles. Swordplay galore. Returning minor characters from the earlier Abercrombie First Law series (including those morbid Eaters). What a fantastic novel! What else could anyone ask for? Ooh, recipes (or maybe, just suggestions for the foodies out there). To wit: A rump steak, then, thick-cut and pan-fried. He always carried a special mix of Suljuk four-spice with him, crushed to his taste, and the oil native to the region around Puranti had a wonderfu"
8053,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,"Had so much to do the past 2 weeks that this took a while but I loved it! However, I didn't love it more than any of the books in the First Law trilogy. This was a different monster for Abercrombie, being the first (I think) book of his that is contained in one book instead of a series. Despite that, I thought the pacing was fine. The story was kinda predictable except for some moments that were really well done. I think my biggest issue was with Monza. Truly did not like her, or enjoy reading h"
8054,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,"What a fantastic read. One massive tale of revenge coupled with extremely curious characters and of the best banter between characters. Monza suffers some heavy losses and survives broken and crippled, betrayed by those she trusted most. Shivers is a man trying to change his life for the better, but just wait to see what fate has in store for him. Morveer, a traumatized but brilliant poisoner. Cosca, extremely cynical and funny. Friendly and his mania of counting stuff. And young Day, Morveer's a"
8055,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,Man I forgot how awesome this world is:D Abercrombie is a master in his genre. The grim and dark is very present here. I loved the characters with shivers being my favourite:) i give this a big 5 stars. Although the ending For me it could have been a little more intense. apart from that...EPIC:D i will be reading the other standalones in the future

Seven men who Monzcarro Murcatto plans to kill. Seven men who betrayed her, strangled her, stabbed her and tossed her broken body down the side of a mountain. They should have made sure she was dead. “Revenge is a dish best served cold,” Said Marie Joseph Eugene Sue in her 1841 French novel, Mathilde . Good advice.

8058,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,"ORIGINALLY POSTED AT Fantasy Literature . I listened to Tantor Media’s audio version which was read by the excellent Michael Page. This was a great format except for one chapter (“To the Victors…”) in which Mr. Abercrombie meant for us to be surprised by who the principal actors were. In the text, section breaks indicate scene (and therefore character) changes. The audiobook reader, however, used the voices for the characters that Mr. Abercrombie meant for us to think were involved. When the trick"
8059,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,"When I participated in NaNoWriMo last November, I attended only one of the group meetings. Why? Because when I described the plot of my book, I Need You to Kill, it was reduced to a revenge fantasy catharsis by the moderator. I wasn't happy about that. I didn't expect high praise or naything but I didn't expect it to be dismissed like that either. Meanwhile, there were two other members there writing lesbian regency romance steampunk books (their own descriptions of the genre) and everyone else"

This guy can write powerful, gripping, uppercut-to-the-chin, fantasy like nobody else. Read his ""First Law Trilogy"" first, then grab a copy of BEST SERVED COLD and enjoy. Here, instead of me writing a bunch of supererogatory stuff where I gush about Abercrombie, listen to the author himself talk about the book and then just try to resist the urge to get a copy of BEST S"

A revenge story of a woman who lost everything and is now willing to tear the world apart in order to get her revenge. Nothing shall stand in her way and survive. Gritty, dark, twisted, bloody and intriguing. A novel that stands out because of its uniqueness. A must read for fans of The First Law trilogy, andba recommended one fo"
8063,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,"Around a week or two ago I had the imponderable pleasure of meeting Joe Abercrombie at Fantasy-Faction’s Grim Gathering. I was reading Best Served Cold at the time, my Abraham Lincoln bookmark treading lightly at 100 pages prior to the finale. I had it signed and told him that I would be writing this review, and that his book was amazing. His response, “Well you better put that in the review!” And so I have Mr. Abercrombie. Because it is. Let us begin… This novel is the account of Monzcarro Murca"
8064,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,"I’m functioning on about four hours of sleep right now because I couldn’t stop reading this book last night. Or I guess early this morning. So hopefully this review actually makes sense. I am going to attempt to describe my feelings about it without fangirling but it’s going to be really, really hard. Best Served Cold takes place after the events of the First Law trilogy but it isn’t absolutely necessary to have read those before reading this one. Given that a lot of the side characters from tho"
8065,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,"I was at first afraid that without my favourite characters from the First Law trilogy this book would turn out to be a bore. I could not have been more wrong. In Best Served Cold, Abercrombie presents us with a whole new set of characters to like. The plot is as always, very interesting and fast paced. It's Styria and there is blood everywhere. The endless twists and turns and the shifting alliances make for a nail biting read. As usual, Abercrombie does not deal with unnecessary landscape descr"
8066,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,"I knew from the beginning I wasn't going to like this as much as The First Law trilogy so I had my expectations slightly low from the start. I think the story started out very good but ended up getting slower towards the end, or rather I ended up getting a little bored of the same thing. It was a decent revenge story but I've seen too many of those and I enjoyed the side characters more than Munzo herself, she was a very bland character in all honesty. Also There was too much betrayal, I know Ab"
8067,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,"An enjoyable, fun read. Maybe I'm just burned out on the blood and guts style fantasy? Or maybe the mindless killing is wearing on me but there seemed to be quite a few overused plot points and a lot of ""jumping ahead"" in this book. No doubt it's well-written and a good book but I just didn't quite get into it like I did the First Law trilogy. I think my issue may be that I really, really enjoy how the North men are written but not so much with the likes of Monza, Orso, etc. I really enjoyed Shiv"
8068,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,"Excellent installment in the author's superbly imagined First Law universe; violent, dark and with all the cynicism you want, it had a great, great ending. Though I would not truly call it a satndalone since most of its subtext and subtler stuff depends quite strongly on his trilogy. Better than LAOK by a lot and on par with his first 2 brilliant books, Joe Abercrombie shows he can do his trademark stuff but be innovative and fresh too. Highly, highly recommended"
8069,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,"“You should laugh every moment you live, for you'll find it decidedly difficult afterwards.” I LOVE Joe Abercrombie. I make it not secret. This is the first standalone after the First Law trilogy. It certainly did not disappoint. A revenge tale at its finest. One should read this just to experience the transformation that is Shivers. It's phenomenal. I need to reread it. NOW. **Reread on October 5th** Still as great as remembered. Shivers is one of fantasy's most underrated characters."
8072,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,"Pure Grimdark: A violent, cynical, amoral tale of revenge, murder, war, betrayal, torture, sex and general mayhem, without a shred of common decency. Not for the squeamish."
8073,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,"It seems like I started reading Joe Abercrombie’s Best Served Cold eons ago, but truthfully it’s only been a month or so. The US version comes in at around 630 pages, making it a hefty tome to get through. In addition to this, I’ve just not had as much reading time as I’d like lately, and something had to give. Finally, and with relief, I finished the novel. Best Served Cold is a ruthless tale, filled with cutthroat, unlikeable characters, including mercenaries, poisoners, killers, politicians, a"
8074,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,"I like Joe Abercrombie a lot. His blog posts, and in particular his re-reads of his own books, reveal him as a blunt, introspective, sometimes insecure, and generally magnetic sort of guy. He excels at creating complex characters with complex motivations, and he subverts fantasy tropes in lots of interesting ways. His First Law trilogy is a seminal work of modern fantasy, and I'd recommend it to anyone who can stomach it. So I went into Best Served Cold with high expectations, but I was actually"
8075,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,"Springtime in Styria. And that means war. It took me a couple of months to get around to finishing this (wimpy yes, I know) but I'm satisfied with the way things ended. Styria is home to the absolute scummiest of scum, there we are witness to the lows humanity can reach and the true horrors one person can inflict on another. Not my usual sort of fantasy read, but if I hadn't come to feel something for the characters then I would never have become so invested in it's ending. How and when and why on"
8076,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,"Halfway through, I was loving it - the initial setup, the characters who couldn't trust each other, the different situations they had to solve. But midway through, when one antagonist did the stereotypical villain speech and refusal to just get down to killing, choosing instead to stretch out the kill until inevitably something improbable happens, I started wondering if there was enough material in revenge to last until all the targets were dispatched. You'd think the antagonist had never read a"
8077,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,"Revenge may well be a dish best served cold but no matter how you serve it, it turns out not to taste as sweet as you imagined. However, and luckily for the reader, it does give you a shit ton to chew over and savour, especially if you're in the mood for another nihilistic, blackly funny and brilliantly characterised look at the pointlessness of it all as Monzcarro Murcatto, the ruthless and feared Butcher of Caprile, is betrayed by those closest her and left for dead, starting her on an orgy of"
8078,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,"Not for people who dislike violence, murder, whole-sale slaughter, sex, graphic sex, incest, swearing, profanity, humour, torture, complexity, magic, betrayal, dark storylines, major characters dying and good writing. A poor little girl and her wicked brother, may he rest in peace, she brought him up, he brought her down. Everyone hated him and quite rightly too. Always remember to kill people properly before you throw them to their death. A motto to live by. An enjoyably grim waltz through the man"
8080,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,2,"I did and I didn't like this book. It has some intriguing characters, that could have withstood a bit more fleshing out. The main character... somehow ends up sitting far too pretty by the end of the story (more then she deserves by half again). She is for a lack of better words... a hateful idiot. Throughout the book she fails to think more than a step or two beyond whats directly in front of her (which makes the likelihood of her being a successful general... a stretch). Just as she is stunned"
8081,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,After my second read I have decided this is my favourite J.A. novel. 5++
8085,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,"One of the things I've always liked about Abercrombie (besides his gritty and satisfying writing) is his ability to write fantasy that gives a care, that feels like a real place. I'm also a fan of the way he creates fantasy stories that feel familiar and satisfying but twist old tropes and cliches on their head in neat ways. This succeeded in all of those sections, with the addition of some characters who, if I didn't admire, definitely held my attention. That being said, I liked the first half"
8086,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,"Another gem in the First Law series, with a few of the supporting characters from the original trilogy taking center stage along with some awesome, unforgettable new ones (Friendly and Morveer in particular) in a gritty revenge tale of unsurpassed bloodiness and wit."
8088,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,Review to come... For now all I'll say is that Abercrombie is in a class of his own!
8089,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,"Brilliant and bloody! Or brilliantly bloody. I had been reading about this book for years. The cover grabbed my attention a few times and friends kept adding it to their bookshelf on Goodreads. I met Joe Abercrombie at a convention, had a nice chat with him (not about his book because I hadn’t read it) and took away a signed copy, vowing to actually read it. Two years later, it was still on my shelf, the wide, dark spine winking at me every time I reached for something to read. What kept it from"
8090,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,"Oh YEAH, baby. We waited for this, and waited, and waited... and then Abercrombie delivered what I have no hesitation in calling a masterpiece in plot twisting, characters, dialogue, and all-out violence. I've tried to review this without gushing, and failed. This hit me as hard as Gardens of the Moon did - I am utterly blown away. A plot summary is simple: Revenge. Monza Murcatto, the hardest, most feared mercenary in Duke Orso's army, is betrayed most violently by her employer - and swears bloo"
8091,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,"Holy God! I just finished the Twilight ""saga"", so I REALLY needed this. I feel like I've spent the last 2400 pages of my life drowning in pancake syrup. Thank you, Joe Abercrombie, for not wasting any time! This book marches like a mercenary with empty pockets. By page 18, all hell breaks loose. By page 45, I was giggling like the fool minion that I am, cheering for my Goddess of War to exact her bloody revenge on every rotten SOB on her list, and kill anyone who gets in her way. Love the motley cr"

8094,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,"Joe Abercrombie continues to astonish. As a writer and storyteller, he is mastering the craft. This is the finest revenge story I've ever read, second only to The Count of Monte Cristo . I listened to the Steven Pacey audio version. Pacey's voice is the bedrock of Abercrombie's world. I recommend listening to the Steven Pacey reading. A funny thing happened while listening to this book. For nearly two thirds of the story, I was convinced that I understood the overall narrative. And while I was c"
8096,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,"Best Served Cold has a particularly gripping start, as Monza and her brother are the victims of an assanation attempt, successful on him, but not so much on our female leading character. After she recovers, Monza vows vengeance on everyone who had a part to play in the botched killing. This novel follows her as she carries out her vengeance. After the romping ride that was The First Law trilogy, I found myself strangely disappointed with Best Served Cold. Don't get me wrong, everything I love abo"

Her health, her followers, and the person closest to her are all gone. She swears revenge, and begins painfully rebuilding her life based on that one goal. Her drive for vengeance brings unintended consequences, and the chaos caused by her choices eventually takes on a life of its own. This is a very, very good book, probably my favorite Abercrombie so far. His style may be too harsh for some, but"
8098,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,2,"Maybe Joe Abercrombie just isn't for me. It certainly isn't how dark and violent his characters are, I was really enjoying that in the beginning (especially in stark contrast to Age of Myth ). And I wouldn't say this book had the same problem as the First Law trilogy, where I thought the plot was advancing at a snails pace. I was immediately into the revenge story. But as the book progressed I became less and less interested. I understand the ending but I question the motives of a few characters"

I can't believe I'm going to say this folks, but I'm afraid to say Best Served Cold by Joe Abercrombie was... absolutely brilliant!! Haha GOTCHA! You thought I hated it didn't you? Never!!! This book blew me away with its awesomeness! Best Served Cold by its very title is essentially what this book is about - betrayal and vengeance. Abercrombie hits us here with another humorous action packed story where we see just how far someone wi"
8100,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,"Joe Abercrombie... the dedication at the start of this novel says it all: For Grace One day you will read this And be slightly worried In his First Law Trilogy there was at most two decent people, everyone else was treacherous, deceitful, sadistic, egomaniacal and/or tragically deluded.

It is very similar in format to Kill Bill, although bloodier, with more psy"
8101,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,"More of a 4.5, but another excellent read by Abercrombie. I had the pleasure of shaking this man's hand recently and telling him to his face how awesome his books are...and I'm so glad that this one didn't disappoint. He's up there with George RR Martin in my books; a writing style where you never know what is coming from one moment to the next and as such, this novel kept me gasping throughout. His plot theories don't come out of the blue, but they come from a place of such imagination that I'm"
8102,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,"3.5 stars It started off good, but got really dragtastic and slow in the middle.. It was, at points, really dry and sort of hard to push through. But it ended well enough to make up for it. One thing that bothered me.. I never got attached to any of the characters. I don't like it when characters are written so black and white, good versus evil, that they become unrealistic.. But the characters in this book are so utterly grey. I had absolutely no one to root for. People died and I felt like it sh"

The work he puts on his characters is next level shit and his t"
8107,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,"This book reads like a D&D session gone horribly, horribly wrong... And that's a good thing. Maybe it's more of a commentary on who I hang out with but as I was reading this grim, swords-and-revenge story I was repeatedly reminded of late Saturday nights spent backstabbing party members for the last piece of treasure. I love how over the top and crazy the set-pieces in this story get. It's essentially a caper/revenge movie with a Dirty Dozen-esque cast of hard-bitten killers and mercenaries,"
8109,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,"Let me not say that this book is lacking in some pretty wonderful, horrible writing; how about the tragic descent of Caul Shivers, for example? Seriously, read the last few pages about him & then go back & re-read the first three or four pages told from his perspective & see how sad & hollow that makes you feel. I also enjoyed the gradual reveal that (view spoiler) [Benna was actually a real dick & his death was totally his fault. (hide spoiler) ] Plus there's just so much Cosc"
8110,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,"A 3.5. I may eventually round up to four rather than down to 4, but not yet. This is a really good tale--self-contained, but set in the same world as Abercrombie's Bloody Nine trilogy--but both the tale and the ending did not satisfy like the earlier books. For once thing the tone was much coarser. Some will praise that as realistic, but it struck more like grasping for shock value. Second, the structure, dictated by the vengeance sought, led to a predictable whole. Third, even in a world of supe"
8112,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,Solid 3.5 stars. A Standalone novel in his First Law World. Gives you the gritty world that Abercrombie has created. Here we have the Grand Duke Orso vs. League of Eight. Wonderful characters througout.
8113,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,2,Best Served Cold was incredibly predictable for me which was so disappointing. This book also had some of the most depressing moments I've ever read. I was indifferent about the majority of the characters except for Shivers. I had to force myself to finish this book.
8114,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,Abercrombie writes like he's 80 and been doing it for that long.
8115,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,"Thoroughly enjoyed. Clever, funny, dark and gritty; everything grimdark fans enjoy. Many betrayals, twists and turns. Loveable rogues and downright bastards galore!"
8116,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,4.5 stars. Ah Shivers... you done got fucked up didn't you?
8117,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,A perfect revenge story. Brilliant. Cold. Cynical. Insanely gory. Full of unexpected twists. Very satisfying.
8118,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,"I sort of don't know why I'm reading more Joe Abercrombie. I read six of his books last year and didn't love any of it. In fact, I'd probably recommend people not read the First Law trilogy, unless they're looking for a very particular kind of story. One that's extremely pessimistic while also being pretty entertaining. The thing is, I'll probably read the next two standalone First Law novels too. I might not even enjoy them, but I'll do it, and I can't really say why. Abercrombie is becoming a mu"
8119,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,"The book club reaction to this book ranged from horrible to meh. I was above meh but there were some big issues. I liked the main character a lot. I loved how your perception of her and her brother slowly shifts as the novel goes on. I enjoyed the secondary characters, though I wish the female ones were better developed. The main issue I had was with the pacing. For such a long book, I needed the plot to pull me along a bit more, but just as I was getting into each part, that Edson would be kill"
8121,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,"As the title suggests, this book revolves around revenge. It delves into examining what a person can turn into, if revenge is an all consuming need; what it can make people do and how it can effect the people around. I loved how we got to meet some of the side characters from the First Law trilogy again, and that we got to see them more fleshed out and delving into their own journeys. Some of them were heartbreaking, others quite hilarious. The new characters were all fantastic as well, flawed and"
8122,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,2,"Finally it’s over! I have moments when I start a book and have a need to finish it even if I don’t like it. Let me tell you, this is the worst book to start and get stuck in that I-have-to-finish-this mood, because this has 744 pages. This is my first Joe Abercrombie book, and as it would seem my last. If I had started with the first book in the series, maybe things would’ve been clearer and I would’ve understood the world, but I didn’t. Maybe that was a mistake but now it’s too late to fix it bec"
8123,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,"This is absolutely better than the First Law Trilogy. I know this is a stand alone but one does need to read the trilogy to get a better picture of wants going on. As with the trilogy I found the graphic sex and graphic violence a tad more then I cared for but overall it was a great tale. I loved the characters and the plot. The examination of the cost of vengeance makes one question one's views on the subject but the underlying, subtle subject of independence is what I appreciate even more. But"
8124,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,"There is not one admirable character in this novel -- which is perfectly fine and precisely what I expect in an Ambercrombie novel (sometimes, you're just in the mood for something grim), but I mention it because there are a few really enjoyable ones. For me, it was not the protagonist, or any of the main players. One was a character by the name of Friendly, and the other -- despite the fact that he's positively repulsive in every way that matters -- a poisoner, for the entirely unintentional, i"
8125,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,"4.5 Stars I thoroughly enjoyed this book and it had many fine qualities. Once again, Abercrombie's characters are awesome. The only reason I did not give this book 5 stars is because of how much I loved the first trilogy and after reading those, this book wasn't quite on the same level for me. Still, Best Served Cold is engaging, relentlessly entertaining and well worth the time!"
8126,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,"I really enjoyed this book. The world growth, the inclusion of new factions, seeing old faces, and the hard boiled revenge was just so satisfying. The only problem I had was with the sex scenes... gratuitous and took me out of the story. 4.5 stars"
8127,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,"Epic as always... A band of misfits on the hunt for vengeance: what could go wrong? Great story filled with its ups and downs. And, typical of Abercrombie, you get all the delightful plot twists towards the end. This book will leave you gasping for more after every chapter. The characters appearing in this book are so intriguing, human and realistic, you can't help but enjoy their foibles, faults and, at times, heroism. I also found this book to be slightly amusing considering its dark theme, ven"
8128,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,"I was pretty excited to start Best Served Cold for two reasons. One, because I’d heard Abercrombie compared to George R.R. Martin and A Song of Ice and Fire is my favorite series. Two, it was a standalone fantasy book, which meant I wouldn’t have to invest myself in a monster of a series. Several months and 630 pages later, I have mixed feelings about Best Served Cold . I enjoyed a lot of what I read, but there was enough that I disliked to keep the book firmly in the realm of “Liked it but didn’"
8130,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,Title kind of says it all. Some twists but fairly straight forward revenge story. Went on a little longer than I would have liked and I enjoyed the secondary characters much more than the mains. 6/10
8131,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,"Reviewed on my blog, Dragonsworn Books Best Served Cold is a stand-alone novel set in the world of the First Law trilogy – a series that I have previously reviewed and praised as one of the most intriguing works in modern fantasy. The World Goes On One thing I noted in my review of The First Law was the ending having a “sour taste of unfinished business about it.” I really like this quality of Abercrombie’s; the world he portrays does not begin and end with the story or the characters in question"
8132,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,"Mr. Abercrombie you’ve done it again! The plot is full of twists, betrayal and revenge galore and, as always, Joe delivers what I have come to expect, wonderful characters so three-dimensional and alive that jump out of the pages. I’m now adding Monza, Cosca, Shivers, and Friendly to the list of my favourites mercenaries! I can’t wait to continue this series. Highly recommended to Fantasy fans who appreciate wit and sarcasm and can tolerate some crude language, violence and sex. 4.5 stars rounded"
8133,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,"I gather this is a stand-alone book set in the same world as the well received First Law trilogy (The Blade Itself, Before They Are Hanged, The Last Argument Of Kings), but I hadn't read any of those, or anything else by Abercrombie, prior to picking this up. I was drawn to the book by a review that emphasized how it was a dark and gritty alternative to standard fantasy epics. My taste in fantasy always ran toward the darkly humorous stuff like Fritz Leiber's Newhon stories, rather than the epic"
8134,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,"A REVIEW OF JOE ABERCROMBIE’S BEST SERVED COLD As I preface all of my reviews, I want to begin by stating that this review is a personal opinion only and should be taken as such. As I am hardly the arbiter of what is good or bad, this should in no way deter someone from purchasing this novel. Best Served Cold is an ugly novel about extremely ugly and brutal people doing extremely ugly and brutal things to each other in the name of power or revenge. Even the rather explicit sex scenes in this novel"
8135,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,"I wrote down while reading this: ""This book is like a Parker novel."" And it is. I've seen other reviewers talk about the Count of Monte Cristo. I can't see that, personally. Monza has no long cons in her, she goes straight after those who have done her wrong. I had some problems with the book. Abercrombie uses a lot of refrains. A lot of refrains. Sometimes it works stylistically, sometimes it's confusing (I believe intentionally) but it is used so frequently that towards the end... I'm no longe"
8136,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,"By the Glory of Slaanesh Joe Abercrombie just puts out one fantastic fantasy release after another! The first 3 books were amazing, with each one consecutively getting better, and this novel doesn't break that trend! The book is broken into several parts, from Monzcarro Murcatto(or Monza) and her brother being betrayed to her travelling all across the country taking revenge for that betrayal and leaving plenty of blood, bodies and hate in her wake. The novel is insanely well written each part take"
8138,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,"Abercrombie writes really well, but unfortunately a lot of this book just felt like too much writing was present. This is, at heart, a story all about revenge and one woman's quest to get it no matter what the cost. It is interesting, well thought out and full of plenty of twists and turns and daring and bloody violence, but for me was missing something. There is plenty to recommend this book - the characters are extremely well thought out and unique individuals, the writing is both readable and"
8139,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,"3.5 stars. I really enjoy a lot of things about Abercrombie's writing, and I enjoyed this book too...just not nearly as much as the First Law Trilogy (which, for the uninitiated, begins with The Blade Itself). One thing I love in his writing is his gritty, painful, raw descriptions of violence. I'm not a fan of gratuitous violence, nor am I a teenager with any kind of violence fetish--much the opposite, really. I'm a 30-something English teacher who is averse to anger and who likes us all to get"
8140,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,"My feelings regarding this book are mixed, in that I kept comparing it to two books; one recent and one old. The recent one is ""The Lies of Locke Lamorra"", with the old one ""The Count of Monte Cristo"". The first comparison is, I think, valid, in that both are written by contemporaries, and both deal with revenge. They both exhibit witty dialog, and although LOLL isn't as gritty and dark, they both deal with ugly things. I won't discuss COMC as a comparative, as it was written in a different time"
8141,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,2,"I always pay close attention to the first sentence in any book. A tone is being set, if nothing else, but often, the focus of what follows is revealed in just a few words. So when I began “Best Served Cold” (Orbit, $24.99, 512 pages), and read “The sunrise was the colour of bad blood,” I figured Joe Abercrombie was going to be taking me on a bloody, dark ride. Sadly, I was correct, and “Best Served Cold” is 500 pages of blood, betrayal, bones, agony, betrayal, blood, bones and more agony. And rea"
8142,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,Best Served Cold further explores new and old characters in the First Law series! :D We are introduced to the character of Monza Murcatto a ruthless cold blooded minded mercenary with a somewhat chewy centre who does her best to hide it by being a ruthless cold blooded mercenary! :D A large proportion of the book revolves around her and her quest for vengeance! :D She is portrayed in a great way that will you wishing her to succeed but at the same time you always suspect that she may have the ru
8143,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,"Almost too much of a good thing in this blistering novel from Abercrombie. He has always tempered the inherent darkness in his stories with humor and a well-rounded approach to character and irresistible narrative pull. The narrative energy and character strength are not lacking, but this book is just so beastly bleak that the humor may seem almost ill placed. The only resistance to reading that this book gave me was in absolutely dreading what would come next for the characters that I had becom"
8144,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,"This is a very nice followup to Abercrombie's amazing First Law trilogy. His writing continues to be excellent and and I look forward to reading his newest book, The Heroes - although probably not any time soon. There's only so much blood, agony and betrayal I can take, and this book more than met my monthly quota. Maybe my yearly quota. Best Served Cold is even more violent than the trilogy, believe it or not. By the end I was becoming wearied and numbed by all the killing. Possibly the author w"
8145,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,I don't really understand why this author's novels get such rave reviews. I have abandoned some of his books previously due to boredom with the writing style but I decided to try this one on recommendation. I liked the characters well enough and the plot was decent but I just don't enjoy this author's style of writing. I never care about the characters much and occasionally find the author is deliberately obtuse in his writing so he can surprise you- all it does is pull you out of the story... a
8146,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,"This was a great follow up to the First Law Trilogy, which if you haven't read you should before you read this. Yes, Best Served Cold is a stand alone but there are tons of tie ins to First Law that you'll miss if you read this first. This one loses a star for two reasons. 1. The story gets a little repetitive in places. The writing's still really good so this isn't a huge problem but after a while you can pretty much predict the general structure of each section. That's not to say there are no s"
8147,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,"As a huge fan of Joe's First Law trilogy, I went into this with high expectations anyway and I didn't come away disappointed. Vivid and well established characters and some nods to previous characters in the trilogy which were appreciated. The battle scenes, as always, are satisfyingly brutal, bloody and graphic and the smut! Oh the smut. Cutting this short, I loved this book. I loved the characters, I love Mr. Abercrombie's style and kind of gritty realism he always seems to maintain, I love ho"
8148,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,"Abercrombie's prose is tight and evocative and just a little bit (okay, a lot) profane. In that regard, this book is just as good as his First Law trilogy, but I just didn't enjoy myself as much in this one. It took me forever to get through, and while I always had a good time while I was reading the thing, I never felt that urgency that's the best part about reading fantasy (about reading any good book, really, but I feel it most often with genre stuff). I guess I'm just not that interested in"
8149,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,"'Kin 'ell, what a book. About halfway through, I was grousing to myself it was taking too long. Even went and looked up how it ended because I couldn't be bothered to read all the way through quickly and I was curious. Kept on reading of course, because its a fantastic crew of characters. First Law I struggled with because most of them had the most punchable souls seen outside Piers Morgan's dressing room but here they're great. Not always likeable, but there's always something to them. It all com"
8150,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,"A note here , because it's too long to be a note :P This could be so good. I almost felt rescpect for the author when Monzacarro Murcatto, Shylo Vitari, and Day were interrogating Carlot dan Eider. Then we got to the long, unnecessary, cringy, dick-oriented, fake, abusive sex scenes that came out of nowhere. After dispersion of the gang we see women in ones, like fookin sore thumbs in the oceans of testicles. Why is it always the same? You're able to create a whole new world, and can't make space"
8151,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,"I think this was the best of the bunch so far, at least in respect to the book arc story. It was a fairly simple revenge story while not being quite the simple at all. I've decided that Joe Abercrombie is using this series for character studies, and that the story is just a framework for those character studies. All of the characters are at once personable and difficult to like, noble and contemptible. Just about the time I get attached to a character enough to want to start cheering for them the"
8152,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,"First off it’s a standalone book and just based in First Law World, one doesn’t need to have read previous books to read this one. As for the book itself I enjoyed it especially for its ending which is full of irony and satire. The book has lots of detailed action, many twist and turns, politics mixed with war and tons of black humor. The story is straight forward that of revenge, the process of vengeance brings in a group of extreme characters, each one unique and colorful in their own way, the"
8153,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,"Well what can I say? I loved it obviously (hence the 5 stars). It continues to amaze me how good Abercrombie really is. Lord Grimdark indeed! If you are looking for poetry to rival the Iliad you won't find it here. What you will get is an honest and brutal account of the true cost of vengeance. Our 'hero', Monza, cuts a bloody trail across Styria to inflict death on those that tried to kill her. In the process she plunges the entire country even deeper into war that has all kinds of repercussion"
8155,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,"Monza Murcatto, bad bitch with a heart... Kind of. This book was fantastic! I'd initially read it about 2 years ago and flew through the pages. I really took my time on the re-read and man it was worth it. Joe Abercrombie creates some great ruthless characters: Monza Murcatto who's hell bent on vengance, Caulfield Shivers who wants to be a better man but just can't seem to get there, Nicomo Cosca, the sarcastic pontificator, Morveer, the narcissistic poisoner, and on and on. The Heroes is my fav"
8156,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,"How to review a book that's simply brilliant? If all you're interested in is if it's brilliant or not then read no further - it's brilliant. A lot of friends insisted that this was Abercrombie's best book. Praise doesn't get much higher than that. Personally, I wouldn't go that far, but only because I'd give the First Law Trilogy 7 stars and Best Served Cold 6. Unfortunately, 5 is as high as it goes. Them's the rules. I've actually already read The Heroes, way back, and enjoyed it, but I'm lookin"
8158,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,"A chance to hear what happened to some of the characters from the First Law Trilogy, and a chance to get to know others better as well as a whole new group. As the title suggests the book is about Revenge, but there is more than one person out there with a grudge. Do find that the Northerners are my favourite group, though I tend to imagine them sounding like Sean Bean. With the first three books there was Logen, now it's Caul Shivers."
8159,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,"Nicomo Cosca I'm in love. There's no Sand dan Glokta in this book, but Nicomo is entertaining enough. Oh, and to keep all the characters in the shady side, that's brilliant. You cannot see which one is the villain and which one is the hero because no one is. They do things because they have to, and to decide whether they are good person or not by that motive is entirely unfair. Love this so much!"
8160,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,"Terrific. Everything that I've come to love about Abercrombie's works, perfected to a spit-shiner polish and amped to gravity-defying levels. violence, black humor, pacing and impossible-to-predict morally ambiguous characters that you loathe and love at the same time. Here is the longer version: bit.ly/19S53EA"
8162,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,"Although I did enjoy this one by Mr. Abercrombie, I thought it felt a bit rushed and might have been better with some more fine tuning. I didn't find it as engaging as his signature trilogy, but it was still entertaining and kept my attention. I will probably return to read his other stand alone books at some point, but I'll put them on the back burner for the time being."
8163,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,"Abercrombie's first stand-alone after writing The First Law. It can be read separately, but there are Easter Eggs for those who have read trilogy first. Like the title implies, this book is about revenge and as such it's a pretty dark book. The unrelenting depressing tone is almost too much with one character falling the farthest of any of Abercrombie's cast so far. 7.5 out of 10."
8164,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,"My biggest complaint is that none of the characters were likeable (and also the book was ridiculously long). Regardless, I enjoyed the book, Abercrombie is one of my favorites. I wish I had reread the First Law books before I started this one. Although it's a stand alone book, I didn't remember much about the First Law characters that appeared in this book."
8165,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,"Simply excellent. Cameos from the previous series, and a couple of retained characters, but entirely new, and all about human relationships and the searing emptiness of hate. The ending is marginally less dour and stalinist than Abercrombie's previous books, but not comparable to traditional fantasy fare by any stretch of the imagination. Can't say enough good things about it."
8166,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,"Actual rating 3.5 stars. A book of tarnished characters. Abercrombie doesn't do black or white pure goodness and pure evil. He likes to give all his characters a good mix of both. I was not able to warm to the characters to the same degree as in the preceding trilogy. As you'd expect from such a book, it was full of treachery and murder...with a dash of humour thrown in to soften the impact."
8167,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,"Joe Abercrombie is one of the greatest of this generation fantasy writers. This book was full of blood and full of comedy. I get stunned how he combines these two. When there is blood bath, there are lines that made me laugh out loud. I liked the character ""Cosca"" and ""Shiver"". God bless Joe Abercrombie!!!"
8168,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,"Never think I'm really going to enjoy Abercrombie. The start was great, and the ""more grimy than mud"" is done well. There was even a sex scene which was remarkably interesting. But he just doesn't do endings well IMO - in fact I find them so bad that the rest of the story unravels from there."
8169,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,2,This novel would have been better if it were half as long as it is. You’d think the author was getting paid by the word. An interesting story that is simply too long. The rating would have nearly doubled with proper length. 5 of 10 stars

Gayer than He-man, gay. So, if you can;t handle lots of gay in your books, skip it. I find it a bit refreshing, if not amazingly melodramatic. That's this books big problem. The story is fine and simple, but boy oh boy, it is as melodramatic as it is gay. This book definitely falls under guilty pleasure, and is probably only a few tiers up fr"

Music is everything to Vanyel with academics running a close second, but his father only wants him to become a brutal swordsman. Others who may relate: those who excelled in their own small pond (small town or small school), but"
8181,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,"Melodramatic, over-the-top, and as subtle as a brick to the skull, this is nevertheless an engrossing read. Vanyel's journey from a spoiled, effeminent musician-wannabee to a heart-broken, effeminent Herald-Mage is really engaging. Teenagers will especially find themselves drawn to this story. The one truly boring part is Vanyel's time spent healing with the elves (or whatever they're called--they're basically mystical Native Americans with equally mystical white hair and magical birds)."

8185,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,1,"It was one of the worst books I've ever read. I read it because many people told me it was great, but, really, it was pure masochism. That level of stupid angst is almost unbearable. The worst things happen to the main hero and he's totally emo all the time. Oh, and tries to kill himself all the time.

Vanyel is the main character and he is very pretty and VERY angsty and NO ONE UNDERSTANDS HIM so he goes to live with his aunt or something. He wants to be a Bard - Bards are like magical
8199,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,"I liked Vanyel. Goodreads consensus seems to be that he's a whiny little shit, and I'm not saying that's not true, but I liked him for his being a whiny little shit. Once in a while you're allowed to be. Vanyel has bad luck with pretty much everything. He doesn't like up to his father's inflexible ideas of masculinity, he's being beaten for being effeminate, and no one understands him. Two out of the three are actual legitimate grievances, and if you think this angst is overblown just wait until"
8200,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,"An emotionally destructive book. It started out so typically YA and then was like ""surprise! Not a YA, this is open heart surgery. BTW we just ran out of anesthesia. Strap in!"" CONTENT WARNING : (view spoiler) [ Homophobia, child abuse, suicide, death of a loved one. (hide spoiler) ] Things to love: - Van and Lendel .

8201,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,"There's lots of praise and lots of laughing about Mercedes Lackey's books, either of which apply for those of her books I read alike. But still, despite constantly reoccuring elements that would bug me into stopping to read other books altogether, I never can put one of her books down. It's no different with Magic's Pawn , first in the trilogy on Vanyel, a character in the Valdemar universe. This book has everything. Absolutely too many italics AND BOLD PRINT, angst, more angst, over the top magic"
8202,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,"I have liked this book more than I have expected. I'm not a typical fantasy fan and I have never read anything by Mercedes Lackey. First of all, the person who wrote the blurb should be banished from writing anything else in his or her life. We have undoubtedly read two different completely books! The blurb says Vanyel is some kind of self-centered prick who was born with a great magical power while in my book he is a very miserable boy who has never known he has magic in him, and who probably wo"
8203,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,"I don't normally like Mercedes Lackey books. I'm not certain why, but most of her stories leave me cold, and I forget about them shortly after I close the cover of the book. But Magic's Pawn is different. I truly care about Vanyel Ashkevron, the main character of this series. He is handsome and proud and arrogant and lonely and desperate and scared and insecure, all at once. There are moments in the story when I wish he would be a little less insecure and chin up, but those moments are rare. Most"
8204,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,"And holy crap, while I'm reminiscing, I think in this trilogy he died at the end? And his horse maybe died too? Oh, and the cover art on these books is subtly seasonal, right, with Book 1 having all like winter imagery, Book 2 like summerish, and Book 3 with falling leaves and things, because you knew his life was almost over? OMG, so sad ! I wonder what would happen if I re-read these, whether it would blow my mind and I'd regress back into sci-fi-dom, or if they'd turn out to be horribly deriva"
8205,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,Oh my gosh were do I even begin. I cried a lot reading this book I connected to the main character on a very deep level that is very personal to me. I don't no what to say about this story except that it was beautifully sad. It could just be that I'm an emotional sap and that's okay. This book also gave me more respect for same sex relations not that I ever had any thing against same sex relationships but theirs always that little voice in the back of my head that (most strait people have) tells

His story is told in one of the trilogies about early Valdemar. His life though fairly ""easy"" due to his father being Lord of his own lands still has many difficulties that lead him to Haven and the early Collegium. His story is the first one I had ever read with a homosexual as the main character, and it really meant something to me. It gave it a normality that just isn't se"

I have to read to know... And I will. 5 stars"
8208,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,"3.75 stars. 1.25 star off for too much hurt, for Lendel and for the very weird lull in the middle of the book. Liked it otherwise, will probably read it again, just not the rest of the series, seeing how the author likes to do away with the characters we get attached to."
8209,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,2,"Look, sometimes you want to read challenging literary works, and sometimes you want to read light fantasy about pretty boys weeping emo tears into the manes of their soulbonded magic horses. Don't judge me."
8210,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,"One of the best series in the Valmair series. It is a must read. If you like these books you will like ""Buring Brightly"" and the ""Vow and Oath"" Series."

8213,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,"4.5 stars from me! this was so much better than i thought it would be. really interesting characters, the main is super powerful which i looove and his character developement in just the first book was fascinating. it also deals with important topics like grief, finding oneself, how to trust and open up to others, lgbt themes and chosen family, which is right up my alley. i'm very excited about where the plot is going in the next two books! it was sometimes a tiny bit confusing for me personally"
8214,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,"2.5? I had a REALLY hard time getting into this, and the rating would be two stars if the last quarter of the book hadn’t gotten a little more interesting. Vanyel is just an ANNOYING character who cannot seem to get past himself. I know he’s sort of supposed to be self-centered and foolish, but it was just such a pain to read. The romantic relationship felt silly and like it happened far too quickly. The plot’s rise and fall felt strange - there was a lot happening and not a lot happening all at"
8215,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,"So much of this book was so irritating but something kept me reading and engaged in the story. The mind-speak is the worst. Not only is the concept of it annoying but that it's stylized with colons and italics. The companions are horrible flat characters. All the men are ""beautiful."" She uses excessive quotation marks for no reason (It ""felt"" like Yfandes)and all of the magic terminology drives me crazy, (they used mind-speak in ""private mode"" at one point, seriously? That's the terminology you'"
8216,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,"No great literature - I have NO IDEA how Lackey thought dashes and semicolons were supposed to be used, and it's a bit pulpy/hysterical at times - but it's so /passionate/. I've read stories that were about on par with MP's quality but without half the passion, and I couldn't get through them; MP could, occasionally, drag a bit, but Lackey allowed her characters to feel and suffer and reveal themselves so freely and with such a sense of entertainment (or... you know, something less disrespectful"
8217,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,"I have not been so engaged in a story quite so VIVIDLY before. I tried to read slowly to pace myself, but about halfway through the book, I refused to put it down. I was there , I was Vanyel, and I felt his pain, his anger, I cheered for him. This is the very first book of Mercedes Lackey I've ever read, and I'm absolutely looking forward to reading the rest of Vanyel's story, as well as other books by this AMAZING author. I highly, highly recommend."
8218,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,Full review here: http://jamesgenrebooks.blogspot.com/2... That this book still affects me so is evidence of its narrative power.
8219,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,"If it weren't recommended by C.S. Pacat , I won't even find this Valdemar universe in Goodreads. The Last Herald-Mage series is one of the sub-serieses of Valdemar series but as I gathered from Valdemar's fans, it's not necessarily to read the sub-serieses in chronological order to dive into Valdemar easily, so I skipped its predecessor : The Mage Wars series entirely and started from this series instead. Needless to say, the world building is magnificent. The Companion and its Chosen, the"
8220,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,"Well, now. This book took me to that magic place, the place where things happen in my head. How can you not love this story? FINALLY a boy who does NOT want to fight with swords and be the strongest, most badass and powerful man alive. No, Vanyel just wants to be a bard, to sing; a boy who has always felt left out, never understanding why, finally comes into his own. It is a high tale of fantasy, of magick of the best kind, of great endeavors and great pain. Of love for animals and people alike."
8221,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,"I happened to remember this book while posting an opinion on the amazon discussion board about romance; basically, about the lack of risk in the romance genre. In my posting, I mentioned the character of Vanyel as an example one of the first gay male heroes in fantasy fiction. However, Magic's Pawn is far more than just a story about his sexuality. In many ways, I see it as the precursor to the ""Harry Potter"" series. Vanyel is a young man with rare talents who doesn't fit in with the hidebound n"
8222,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,"Aww, bb!Vanyel. When I read Arrows of the Queen , I didn't know that the book Talia is reading at the beginning was actually going to be a story we'd get to read! Vanyel is mentioned a bunch of times throughout Talia's story, so we know a bit about what is going to happen to him and what he'll do, but not how he gets there. Warning: this book has a lot of teen angst, and if you don't like that sort of thing, you should stay away from this book. Basically, horrible things keep happening to Vanyel, s"
8223,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,1,"I read this book (and the full LHM trilogy) many, many years ago, and really remembered it largely as being horribly, tragically, soul-suckingly depressing -- not so much because of Vanyel, but because of the Herald-Magery going away. On at long-last reading it again, I find myself being depressed more by ... just how godawfully bad this book is. Melodramatic-to-bathetic gay romance doesn't begin to describe it. There's a terrible waste of interesting characters in service to the most emo angsty"
8224,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,"I feel like I need to explain this one. Mercedes Lackey was easily my favorite author when I was a kid. I was obsessed. I wrote Heralds of Valdemar fanfiction. I ran Heralds of Valdemar roleplay sites. All I talked about was this series of books. But for some reason my parents didn't have this book, and I knew from having read the second two in the series that they featured a gay guy with a magic talking horse and oh my God guys, I just can't describe how desperately I needed this book. So I told"
8225,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,"Don't get me wrong, this isn't a stunningly well-written trilogy but I have always enjoyed it- I guess for its tragic story-arc. This is one of Mercedes Lackey's series set in Valdemar, a world with Companions (intelligent horses), magic, bards, bond-birds, and of course various and sundry foes. This, however, is by far my favorite of any of the Valdemar series. Vanyel, while initially a difficult to stomach troubled youth, turns out to be quite the tragic hero. He's somewhat of a failed-bard-turn"
8226,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,"Vanyel Ashkevron is the eldest son and heir apparent to a rural lord, but his aspect doesn't quite fit the role. Vanyel is attractive, gentle, and musical instead of being burly, aggressive, and undereducated. In other words, Vanyel is gay, which doesn't usually work out well in what is essentially a feudal society. After a great deal of abuse at the hands of his family, Vanyel is shipped off to Haven to live with his aunt, a herald. He finally meets someone and falls in love, but that has probl"
8227,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,2,"***************** Possible spoilers******************** Vanyel is pretty boy who prefers music over fighting. His father is constantly pushing him to man up. Seeing that his methods are not working, he sends V off to his sister, Savil, who trains magic users. Vanyel is utterly depressing and wears his arrogance as a shield to let no one affect him. At the school he meets a Mage named Tylendel, who sees V for who he really is and they fall madly in love. From there it's like Romeo and Juliet (exce"
8228,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,2,"Awful, just awful. Amateurish writing - italics everywhere, and everyone acts like book characters rather than real people. Annoying nicknames. Angst everywhere. Vanyel is utterly pathetic - ""everyone would be better off without me"" again and again and again, completely self-indulgent wangst.

And urgh, Vanyel's relationship with Tylendel i"

I did so at a time when I was feeling emotionally very fragile and stressed, so it's a credit to Lackey's writing that this book (which I think is probably her best ever) held up and I still loved the story despite its difficult subject matter at times. I would like to get on with Magic's Promise , but I'm trying to take things slowly and as they com"
8230,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,"This is one of my favorite books, and the first I read by Mercedes Lackey. The rest of her books seem to be a variant on this basic theme... But as far as her books go, this -- and the rest of The Last Herald-Mage Series -- is probably the pinacle of writing on this theme. When I first read this, my ability to relate to the protagonist hit me like a ton of bricks. I had a good long cry, read it again, and have since always kept a copy handy. I typically read this when I'm having a really rough we"
8231,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,2,"Reading reviews completely spoils this book for me... As me self.. I cant finish, not because whiny protagonist or why everyone pity the hero, honestly i don't even bothered by those points.. The thing i cant grasp is how supposedly a 'grandma' talking with 'young adult' with no character like it was a one sided conversation given by the same person.. I just cant distinguish them and connect with how they think and behave.. Like seeing this world in another dimension entirely heh.. I do agree tho"
8232,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,"I really enjoyed this book. As a gay kid, Vanyel's story is very relatable... Well as much as it can be in a fantasy setting. For those saying it's so ""melodramatic"", well... That's typically how it is when you're a closeted gay kid who can't live up to his father's expectations of manliness and who worries all his loved ones will abandon him if they knew. It sucks... The fantasy aspect is also really good and the story was interesting enough to get me to the end. I've already bought the second"
8233,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,"I haven't been into Sci-Fantasy before, but this was much more: love, magic, family complications, empowerment, companionship, lose of love, survival, 12th century sorcery, 21st century venacular, 20th century author, and today's relevance...truly emotional, this caught my attention from a high school friend's recommendation to another friend of his.

8234,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,2,"DNF. I read half. The writing was clunky. Little happens. The characterization wasn't done well--the descriptions of the protagonist were repetitive, and he isn't likable. I was bored, but kept expecting the plot to get going at any moment, so I stuck with it. There was a surprise a little less than halfway through, but then it continued to be boring. By halfway, I realized I didn't actually care about the plot or when the protag might find out he has magic, or when the larger conflict would sta"
8235,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,"This is the first book in the first series ever to make me weep. It's a series that you'll either love or hate, there is no gray area in between. Thankfully I had already had a friend come out of the closet and had kicked the male preconceived notions of homosexuality. This book almost worships the male relationship. If you can open your mind enough to simply look at it as love. This series is phenomenal."
8236,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,2,"Oh my did I love this book with white-hot passion when I was 14, which was long enough ago that I could not go online and find other fangirls to create fanfic with. (Although a few years later we did try to put together ValdeMUSH, but alas, Lackey's lawyers stopped us.) Now -- well, I can't judge it fairly now; it's just too impossible to read it without remembering my younger self being absolutely astonished and in love with this book."
8237,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,2,"Gosh the melodrama! Do 15 year olds really suffer from such violent mood swings? I can't fault Mercedes' writing. She tells a compelling story. The Dreamspinner Press copy of the book I had was full of typos, but the original published book I read a long time ago was not. Once, a long time ago, this was just my cup of tea, but in a re-read, I'm too old, too cynical, and too much for stark realism. Thus, my rating isn't for the writing or the plot, but my enjoyment."
8238,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,"I was obsessed with this book when I was young. With the insight of age I can see its flaws--chief among them a certain amount of emotional immaturity--but I owe an awful lot to this story as a writer and a person. --SPOILERS-- Van loses his lifemate and everyone around him is pretty much sick of him whining about it in a MONTH. A MONTH, PEOPLE. This is a problem that dogs her writing, in my opinion."
8239,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,"I read this trilogy years ago, when I was on a field training exercise in the Army. I was desperate for something to read, so this girl loaned them to me. I remember them as being fun, quick reads that kept my interest, without being something that demanded a lot of concentration. I might be rating them a star higher than they're worth, because of the nostalgia factor. But if you like girly fantasy stories and you need something to read on a plane, then these would do the trick."
8240,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,This is a CLASSIC fantasy series and the first one that I every read that featured a gay man as the lead. It still remains one of my all time favorite fantasy series to this day. I grew up on these books and would encourage any young adult or adult fan of fantasy to give them a try. I would also recommend these books to animal and horse lovers.
8241,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,1,Didn't finish it. I found Vanyel tedious and the writing grating and a little amatuer. It's probably the kind of book I would have enjoyed in my early teens when factors such as the writing style wouldn't have bothered me.
8242,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,"A series with real importance to a closeted young gay kid struggling with coming out. And, yes, I re-read the series when working on Blue Rose for Green Ronin Publishing ."
8243,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,1,"This book reads like a fanfic written by a twelve year old. I might have liked it at that age, but I'd like to think I had better taste. Unless you're a preteen looking for an unbelievable and saccharine tale of forgettable, camp characters, avoid this one."
8244,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,This is another rating that is more reflects the nostalgia I get from re-reading this book than the actual book itself. There are definite flaws but this book is like comfort food. A lot of empty calories but the experience gives me warm fuzzies.
8245,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,Just adding this book to complete the five-starring of this trilogy for my #readinghistory. I hopelessly screwed up the order of these books. *sigh* I'm sure you're all smart enough to figure it out though!
8246,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,Been a long time since I re-read this and I forgot how annoying Vanyel is in this one...I wish there had been more relationship development. Almost too short... solide 3.5.
8248,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,2,I read the whole thing.
8249,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,Oh silly talking horses.
8250,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,"This book ripped my heart out. If you want a happy gay romance with magic and pretty unicorns, put this book down right now. It’s not for you. Vanyel Ashkevron grows up with huge disadvantages. For one, he does not even know what shay’a’chern means (the Tayledras word for homosexual), that anyone could love another of the same sex. And second, his father is trying to force on him his own idea of a manly man, basically a war hero—something that goes against Vanyel’s very nature. Vanyel has a strong"
8251,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,Great series. Vanyel was a whiner but you can't help but mourn his losses anyway.
8252,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,"This book was an interesting, interesting little piece of gay history. For me this was one of the first novels starring a gay protagonist I ever picked up, as a young gay man who wanted to enjoy more self-representative works, even though I only just got around to reading it. Released in 1989, I wasn’t surprised to find that this was one of the first fantasy novels starring a heroic gay character ever, and the book deserves major credit on that alone. This very fact divides my opinion to some ext"
8253,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,"Probably groundbreaking for its time... I write this review knowing this book was written in the 1980s, and so was way ahead of its time by having a gay main character and exploring gay relationships. BUT... The representation is just steeped in tragedy and misery. RELENTLESSLY. The MC, Vanyel, starts out understandably miserable considering his crappy lot in life as a unloved weakling, artsy son of a macho strongman provincial lord of a father. But as the book goes on, Vanyel it seems just whines"

Let me start off by saying, I read all of this in essentially one sitting on the airplane from Utah to Florida. So, yeah, it all felt a little fast-paced, but bear in mind it might have been a little more fleshed out than I remember. Either which way, I'll start at the top!

For a long time, I've been wondering how he'll ever be a Herald (not that he behaved evilly or something but some people are just not wired that way in order to be a Herald) and then? *sobs* I really liked the lovestory between Tylendel and Vanyel and how 'Lendel managed to draw Van out and let him see that there isn't just loneliness and pain and hurting. And then? Yeah, I'm a bit angry at 'Lendel. I get him a bit but still. :( And, poor, p"
8256,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,"I can't really separate out the book that ""Magic's Pawn"" is from the work that it's doing and the time in which it was written. A mainstream fantasy author, writing in the late 80's - following the AIDS epidemic, when homosexuality was stigmatised and attacked by governments and celebrities - wrote a coming of age novel, where a teenage gay protagonist is rejected by his parents, faces death and depression, and considers suicide, but finds love and unconditional support with an adoptive family w"
8257,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,"This book was unexpectedly fantastic! It starts interestingly enough, but Vanyel as the main character quickly becomes tedious. He comes across as arrogant and childish, and you can't fault the fact that everyone that interacts with him isn't overly fond of him. Except for Tylendel. The story picked up even more when the relationship between Vanyel and Tylendel starts. The character development of Vanyel as he starts to grow up is such a startling change, you can't help but forgive everything he"

Small of stature, fair of face, and with no talent for combat with heavy arms, he's the object of abuse and ridicule by his father, his father's advisers, and even his younger brother.

8259,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,1,"This came very well recommend off a Reddit thread when I was looking for fantasy literature with queer leading characters, but boy was I unimpressed. A good third (or half) of the book is an endless allegory for the pain of being queer in a world that over appreciates brutality and virility. I understand it's probably very relatable if you're reading it as you're going through it, but so incredibly boring if you've already processed all of it. I also applaud authors who choose to write character"
8260,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,2,"DNF, 2.5 I am honestly really disappointed with this one. I'd heard SUCH good things about it, & that I would absolutely love it, since it was high fantasy and had gay characters. But eeeek, nope, did not like it. It started off really slow & I thought that maybe I just needed to get a bit further before I could get in to it. But 50 pages in, I'm still not enjoying it. And as it goes on, the dialogue and dynamics between the characters are suuuper weird. (Is this what fantasy writing was"
8261,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,"This is one book I can pick up anywhere at anytime and read. Vanyl's character development hits home for a lot of people, myself included, especially his idea that by not reaching out to others, he'll prevent himself from getting hurt.

8263,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,1,"Bought this during my quest to find gay books. Couldn't even make it to the halfway point on this one, despite the fact that it has pretty good reviews. What's more, this isn't the sort of ""couldn't get into it"" book that you can come back to and try again later. This is more like the ""I wish I hadn't bought this"" book that you intend to get rid of as soon as the opportunity arises. I don't want to be too harsh, because people who quit books before finishing are the ones who miss out on the part"
8264,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,"In reality I would give this book a 3.5 I've become a fan of Mercedes Lackey recently for the nostalgia her writing gives me for moments I never had. I wish I had come across this series when I was 15 like so many people leaving reviews. While this book was enjoyable, it felt a lot shallower in its approach than the books I've read so far from this world. A bit too melodramatic for my taste. Vanyel has had a tough life and there's no denying it, but the level of submission he shows and takes so"
8265,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,"This is by far my favorite of all her books. Then again I read this in high school and I think I fell a little in love with Vanyel. His character was rich and I could feel what he was going through even though I couldn't relate his life at all. I read the book so much the cover fell off. I taped it back on and then again when it fell off. I still have the original book and until the last few years, since it is packed away with all most of my library, I would go back and read it over and over and"

I bought the whole series, and I still have them sitting on my shelf. And since it's been 15+ years since I read them, I decided to read them again. I liked it, but I didn't love it as much as I thought I would, and definitely not as much as I used to. I like Vanyel, but sometimes I wanted to smack him because he was so. damn. dramatic.

Vanyel was an insufferable twit and difficult to like (which was the whole point i understand that...) Vanyel just does not fit in at Forst Reach, his father's holding. While he is the heir to the Hold he is not what his father wants him to be, and Vanyel is fine with that. But when Withen sends him away to the capital to be fostered by his Aunt Savil, Vanyel see's this exile for what it really is. He has al"
8268,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,"Re-read this book which I just loooooved when I first read it. I was a bit hesitant - would it live up to re-reading with over twice as much life lived in between, or would I throw it aside as youthful folly? I have been reading some of her later works but really not been that enamoured with them - was that because the books were less enthralling or because I was less easily enthralled? Fortunately, it turns out it was the former. I still loved this book - less than when I was the target Young Ad"
8269,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,1,"Oh, man, this book was brutally tough to get through. I found Vanyel incredibly whiny, and he grated on my last nerve from the very beginning. So much whining and moaning and groaning about his fate without actually doing anything about it. He's one of those characters to whom things happen, rather than being proactive about his fate in the world. I also found the writing incredibly repetitive. The same point was driven home again and again, page after page reminding us of things we already learn"
8270,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,"So this was a reread - I devoured this series like my life depended on it when I was in high school, but I haven't touched them since then. But I was looking for literary comfort food, so I decided to go back and give them another look. And oh geez, does this NOT stand up. Looking at this now, Vanyel is a whiny, self-pitying narcissist, the plot is thin to the point of nonexistence, and the abuse of stress italics might actually be killing me. And by today's sensibilities the Tayledras are a kind"
8271,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,"Admittedly, I picked this book because of the cover. There's a horse! And she even has a role in the story. I'm not sure if I will finish this entire series. I enjoyed the writing, but the plot as well as characterization left me a little cold. It's definitely one of the better fantasy books, and the audio version I ""read"" had a pleasant narrator who managed to bring the story to life. I found myself more interested in the side characters than the hero, which seems to be a pattern with me. There"
8272,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,"This book was very entertaining. I found the main character, Vanyel, very fleshed out and three-dimensional. However, the pacing of the book felt very off to me. For instance, Vanyel arrives at the Court his aunt lives at and most of his first days there are skipped over. We cut to a month later, and he's getting together with his love interest. There's no build-up to this point, and after sleeping together, they immediately declare their love for one another. Later events make it clear why the r"
8273,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,2,This fantasy trilogy is a prequel to the Heralds of Valdemar trilogy and features the story of the last Herald-Mage. Some legends of Vanyel were told in the Heralds of Valdemar books but you don't need to have read those books first. Vanyel is a great character but in this first book he is an annoyingly whiny and self-absorbed teenager. I guess he is acting his age but it gets tiresome. He convinces himself all the time that everybody hates him and so shuts himself off from the world. He falls i
8274,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,"Rereading of an old favorite. This is a great series by a wonderful author. I can't even say how often I have read/ reread all the Valdemir books. They are my book equivalent of comfort food. I choose this book to be my first Audible book because it is so familiar. (I was unsure I would be able to keep my attention to a book being read to me while on the back of a motorcycle, obviously not a place I thought I could read a regular book). I found the reader of the book used a VERY melodramatic voice"
8275,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,"Holy guacamole and frijoles! I think this trilogy might end up being my favorite in the entire Heralds of Valdemar series! The plot, the characterization, the prose, the conversations between characters, were all so beautiful! I love Vanyel and all of his friends so much! My heart soared and broke in equal measures, and I found myself legitimately bawling multiple times, due to happiness and sadness and somewhere in between! Vanyel has such beautiful character development, and just... This book"
8276,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,"Every time I read a Mercedes Lackey book I think ""That's me, that's me."" She understands different types of trauma and defensive behaviors, how they emerge, and what they're tying to protect. The character relationships and interactions is why I read the books: They feel real, and make me feel understood. The plot arc was extremely standard for a Valdemar book. Honestly, no surprises. I really wish she spent last time on deepening the trauma and more on fixing it (""magic"" as cop out), but maybe t"
8277,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,"I wasn't originally reading this book, but another of Lackey's books, when I had the strongest urge to read a few scenes from this book, and that turned into an almost all-nighter while I read the entire book instead. I remember reading it years ago and loving it to death. The wow-ness has faded , but i still enjoyed reading it this time around. It seems more of a young adult book than an adult book due to the writing style, but the story is entertaining. I'm reading the second book now and am s"
8278,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,"This series isn't bad. It has an interesting setting and interesting magical conceits, and the story was enjoyable. There's a lot of good absurd melodrama, so if that works for you, you might like this. Despite a gay MC with a major character romantic interest, the romance is... weirdly not fleshed out. There's a lot of ""they spent lots of time together"" and not a lot of the author showing us how they spent time together. The author in general seems to have an issue with telling instead of showi"
8279,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,"Okay so this review comes from the perspective of a young gay guy. I loved it. I see others say if was such a surprise. It wasn’t. First off, we hear in other books about Vanyel and “Tylendel” which doesn’t sound like a feminine name. So I knew he was gay, and then he was the typical Bard, lanky and cocky. So it was kinda very obvious. I don’t understand the people calling him Whitney because, his life sucks ass when he’s whining. He has dealt with abuse and such, and when he does find love and"
8280,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,2,"Look, I enjoyed the book. Up until a point. I feel like it's a product of its time and as a book initially published in the 80s or something I was pleasantly surprised to find that it centered on a young gay man. Except. Well.... it's not exactly the most well written book. Engaging as it was, the writing style felt juvenile and certain narrative choices left me feeling sick in my stomach (if you've read it you know what I mean, if not. Well, content warning for suicide and self harm) and unable"
8281,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,"A heartwrenching read that really hit home in how the MCs depression was written. So much of this book is tragedy, and the plot for most of it is on a small, personal scale. I love Savil as a character and she is by far my favorite in the book. Her and Andel's old, familiar relationship was -kisses fingers like a chef-. A good bit of Vanyel's development deals with acceptance in the face of social disapproval, I just wish so mich of it wasnt couched in tragic circumstances."
8282,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,"I didn't want to rate it so highly... But I didn't have a choice. I first read this years ago, on the cusp of coming out. To say that it had a tremendous impact on me is an understatement. I cried multiple times reading this because there was a lot of sadness to go around. Yes, Vanyel is that ""more special than anyone"" character, but not without a major cost. It set him on the right path. Can't wait to dive into the next book in the trilogy."
8283,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,So good- I love this book so much. I like how it takes place in it's own magical and creative world. I like the morals- but how they are there without showing too much in a cheesy way. The whole book felt like a puzzle where in the very beginning you have only a few pieces and none of them fit together so you are left trying to figure it out and then getting contradicted as more pieces are added all for the better.
8284,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,"Honestly? I liked it, but it was a bog march to get through and a little lacking in direction. The protagonist was a total Mary Sue who laid around healing from one near-death experience to another and his romance was so shallowly-constructed that I expected the suicide. I'll give Lackey a break because she published this in '89, but modern writers be warned: I will cut you if you portray us this way."
8285,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,"4 stars YES I finally finished this book, and it got so much better throughout. The first 25% were hella boring, but I continued. I stopped reading this almost half-way through it, but recently decided I needed to pick it up again, and holly mother, was the second half a rollercoaster of angst and angst, and just a little more of angst. Vanyel, you poor thing, I wish that in the next book something good will happen to you."
8286,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,"I really wish I had found this series when I was a teenager. Magic, unicorns, gay romance... that's me all over. However, I read it when I was late 20s and found it to be painfully melodramatic. I couldn't even manage a guilty pleasure out of it--just too much angst, too many typos to try to look past. Oh well! If the premise sounds interesting, read it and decide for yourself."
8287,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,"First 50 pages I enjoyed then really got tired of the main character's self problems and thoughts. Wasn't until the end did I get interested again. Wished the author developed the minor characters and expanded more on ""gifts"" each had. Also didn't get into the horses - Chosen - enough. I did finish the book."
8288,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,"I cannot express enough how much I loved this book. I was a bit hesitant when I read the reviews. They kept saying that Vanyel was whiny, I did find him whiny at all ( Harry Potter was whinier than him). The only reason that I did not give this book five stars is because if the writing. The writing was annoying and confusing at times, but overall it was a very enjoyable book."
8289,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,"It kept me reading until 3:30am so I feel like I have to give it three stars. I would have adored this when I was fifteen; I still enjoyed it, but now the ~drama (of the plot more than Vanyel tbh) made me roll my eyes a few times. Not a too unrealistic portrayal of teenagers though and I appreciated that there were scenes with outsider PoVs to keep it in perspective."
8290,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,"I first read this book many years ago, but having found it again on kindle, I decided to read it again. My opinion then is the same now. I really enjoyed the story and it's characters. I spent whole afternoons reading over the weekend which I have not done in a long time. Now rereading the next one."
8291,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,2,"2/3 of the book is people processing their emotions, as internal monologue or with one another. Unclear if the emotional processing would be less of a slog if Vanyel was less whiny and obnoxious---I don't think so. It's not Lackey's best book. But it's a classic of gay fantasy. Best read by preteens."
8292,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,"An excellent read with well crafted characters. In particular, Lackey shapes Vanyel’s character masterfully and, although the angst-ridden inner workings of the protagonist’s brain might be too much for some, I was completely sold. In my opinion, Vanyel’s relationship with Tylendel was the real star of the novel. Highly recommended."
8293,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,"All i could think is why hasn't this book been optioned as a movie. My favorite quote from this book is ""This I think I have learned: where there is love, the form does not matter, and the gods are pleased. This I have observed: what occurs in nature, comes by the hand of nature, and if the gods did not approve, it would not be there. I give you these things as food for your heart and mind."""
8294,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,1,A cheesy book about a young man that are misunderstood by his father and send to his aunt. There he finds out he is gay and when his lover dies he gets superpowerful magic gifts and a magical horse. I did not enjoy it. To much of the sexual parts made the story falter and made me skip alot to get to the end. The last 30 pages were ok.
8295,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,"Magic's Pawn was the first book I picked up (at the tender age of 12) and could not put down until I'd finished it. Vanyel's story has been one that I've read time and again, an old favourite, a forever friend. I highly recommend giving this story a read! This story brought about my love of reading and stoked my writing embers."
8296,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,"Loss, grief, pain, hope, and finally redemption. And artful beginning to what promises to be an epic tale. I look forward to the next book in the series. Luckily, I already have it cued up on my kindle and ready to go. ;)"
8297,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,I wanted it to be better but it dragged and the protagonist was painfully annoying until nearly the end. I am happy it exists because of the same sex love story and the positive depiction of gay and strong female characters but I guess my hopes were too high.
8298,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,"There was a great deal of whining, but I suppose this book was set up to show the progress of the main character. Hopefully the next two books in the series will help me admire , rather than just feel sorry for him."
8299,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,"definitely reads as an origin story, one I really enjoyed! I remembered liking the book when I read it as a teenager but wasn’t sure if that would continue. I never did read the rest of the trilogy so I’m excited to do that now."
8300,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,"I never in a million years would have guessed I would actually read this book, let alone absolutely love it. It's nothing special really but I couldn't put it down. I had to know what s going to happen."
8301,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,2,"This started off really super cute, but then I realized that no real, substantial story was ever going to develope and I couldn't wait for it to end. Probably will not pick up the next book in the series."
8302,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,"This book was as delightfully trashy as I remember it, and actually handles a gay protagonist far better than you would expect from a book this age. It's fun, light fantasy if that is what you are feeling."
8304,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,"Excellent starter book for those just getting into the Heralds of Valdemar Series as this is the 1st book in the Heralds timeline. Good for anyone pre-teen and older & like all her Valdemarian books, one I've enjoyed reading repeatedly over the past 20 years."
8305,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,"Not sure what it says about me (or the book) that while I have completely forgotten the plot, I still enjoyed reading it a second time. Does this make it a good book (enjoyable plot) or a bad book (easily forgotten)? (ಠ.ಠ)"
8306,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,"My heart is so heavy I think it might break my bones and drop to my feet. This book tore my heart to pieces and hot glued it back together too many times to count...It hurt so bad, and I wanted it to stop and never stop at the same time."
8307,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,3.5 stars I'm going to read the whole trilogy. Eventually.
8308,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,Solid fantasy novel and my first look at Mercedes Lackey's work.
8309,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,Gripping. Stunning. Reaches into your heart and tears it out while bandaging up and offering it back to you.
8310,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,Re-Read -- Awesome book.. Great series.. Great author!
8311,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,1,"the whole series started out promising and the first book leaves at an ok place... but I don't really like the way the main character develops. at all. sorry, but not for me."
8312,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,1,"Yeah, no. I really didn't like it. The MC was whiny, the narration was bad. I didn't like anything about this book."
8313,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,"This book is an enduring favorite of mine, and someday I plan to repurchase the entire set again."
8314,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,My only problem with this book was the writing. I feel like I couldn’t follow what was happening most of the time. But maybe that’s my own careless reading. *shrug*
8315,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,"Gay kid's boyfriend screws up and gives him magic powers. He doesn't want the powers, but he learns to deal with having the powers."
8316,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,Listened to this on Audible. NNArration was a little dull but the storyline was good enough to keep me listening.
8317,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,Little bit too much teenage angst in this but the magic is fun.
8318,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,It's the start of one of Lackey's best trilogies. Read it if you love fantasy that is character-driven.
8319,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,"The last one hundred pages bumped this down a star. But oh my gods, the romance in this! I wish there was more of that because I loved it so much. It melted my icy heart and made me squeal. So cute."
8320,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,This book hurts in the best kind of way. DO NOT read if you are triggered by suicide or suicidal ideation.
8321,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,Fantastic novel and start to one of my favorite trilogy. I have read this one at least 4 times.
8322,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,Really enjoyed this book. Definitely a big step up from the first three books.
8323,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,"Really loved this world, and my heart broke right alongside the protaganist’s, but I felt kind of dissatisfied at the end. A bit rushed? Still, hasn’t put me off heading to book two!"
8324,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,2,"Aside from the odd slut-shaming remark here and there (only against female characters, of course) I liked it. The writing style just isn't for me though, and I found myself struggling to finish it."
8325,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,A magnificent story and extremely well executed.
8326,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,This was my favorite of her series while in middle school and I kept reading and rereading in high school.

At first he is terrified, but soon he realizes that he is finally free to discover the truths about himself. He exper"
8337,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,"Magic’s Pawn certainly did not disappoint. Well, as far as the gay fantasy aspects of it go. The story follows the dreadfully dreary character Vanyel as he is abused by his father, his teacher, and basically everyone who knows him, to the point he is emotionally stunted. Eventually his father throws his hands in the air and ships Vanyel off to live with his aunt, a powerful and important Herald-Mage. There, he finds some measure of acceptance, acts like a dick, and almost kills everyone until he"
8338,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,"This was a better book in nearly every way. It starts out in a similar vein to Arrows of the Queen : under-appreciated youth in a remote area of the kingdom is a total misfit and unhappy about it. However, the characters here are far more complex and the story takes a different turn from the beginning. Young Vanyel is a scrawny, musically-inclined (but not Gifted) heir of the minor gentry, and he is also exceptionally unlikeable. Lackey's writing throughout this section paints a layered picture o"

This will be a rambling review, so please forgive me, I'm having a hard time trying to figure out what to tell you so you will read it, but not too much where you feel you don't need to.

Before I start, I'm a gay man and so my review holds no underlying homophobic elements at all. In fact, quite the opposite and hope you appreciate my views. For the most part the book it fairly well written and Lackey's manner is very easy to navigate and absorb, but writing aside the rest is just bloody awful. I me"
8343,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,"I loved this. Loved it. Okay, maybe not a first, but after I started getting into the book the annoyances I had at the beginning made sense. Magic’s Pawn by Mercedes Lackey does seem to have a MAJOR polarizing effect with its fans; you either love it or you hate it. Now, why did I love it particularly? The overall plot line is pretty stupendous. A teenage boy, obviously at odds with his family’s expectations of what it means to be a man, is sent to a distant aunt to “straighten up and be manly.”"

In my small town it was considered enlightened to say something like “I have no issue with gay people, but why do they have to rub it in my face by kissing in public.” I was in high school when Friends first came on tv, and it was considered ahead of its time given it’s “positive” portrayal of Ross’s ex-wife (while incredibly problematic through today’s lens).

Which is exactly why I love it. Let me add, then, that I'm not usually a fan of drama in this sense. I've never been the sort of reader to cry buckets of tears over doomed love stories.

He does not take after his father and finally his father sends him to Aunt Savil to be put on track. What happens next, no one would have expected but suddenly Vanyel has a great and terrible power and it must be brought under control or everyone around him might suffer the consequences. A lot happens in this first book. I suppose a lot happens in most of Lackey's books thus why you can hardly get"

Unfortunately he’s also the heir to his father’s estate, so music isn’t a career that’s in the cards for him. He’s too small and fine boned to sword fight like his larger bulkier brothers and cousins, but his swordsmaster feels that the fast feint and dash method that would match his build is “cheating.” Jervis promptly breaks his arm in punishment for “cheating.” Apart from his older sister Lissa-who is sent away within the first chapt"

After discovering her when quite young, I still follow new additions to the series - nearly twenty years later! I read and re-read these books over and over again throughout my youth, but I haven't re-read this series in its entirety in a long time - and never as an adult. There are some new books added to the series since the last time I read them, so this re-reading project is pretty exciting for me since"
8353,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,"Now this?!? This is a book with a teenaged protaganist - a young adult novel as it were - that reaches deep into the pockets of your soul and nestles there, staying with you long after you have closed the back cover. I don't know if The Last Herald Mage series is technically YA, but if it is, then it is fabulous YA, and proof that good YA can be just as good adult fiction. Young Vanyel is the oldest son of the cruel and uncompromising Lord Within, and set to inherit his dad's estates. But poor Va"
8354,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,"This is one of the most hard-hitting books that I’ve read in a long time. Ever since I read The Pact by Jodi Piccoult, actually. I think that it probably impacted me so heavily because Lackey investigated ideas of depression and not really believing that you are worth the air you breath. Feelings that I experienced a long time ago. This reminded me of those moments, but it also reminded me that I got through it and the strength that it can take to overcome such a debilitating illness. This book f"

I have always been a fan of fantasy novels and I saw plenty of Ms. Lackey's books on the shelves, but never felt overly compelled to make a purchase. Well, my girlfriend's insistence that I read this particular novel prevailed and now I am writing a review. The beginning of this novel really irritated me as it revolved around a character exhibiting a high level of teenage angst. Now, for tho"
8356,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,"I had this book on my radar for a long time. I probably first heard about it when I was around sixteen, and I so wish that I had read it back then. I am sure it would have... resonated with my teenage self, haha. Obviously, I still enjoyed it enough to give it 5 stars, but the reason I wish I would have read it back then is because this is a fantasy novel centered on a teenager with very strong teenage themes. There's teenage angst, young love, some moping, some ""nobody understands me!"" moments,"

Bless this book. I can easily see how it would have been confronting and challenging in the 80s. Even the mid-2000s. I can see plenty of young people having been duly educated by this book about how wrong it is to hate the queer people in your life for something they couldn't help. I can see plenty of young people discovering what same-sex attractio"
8359,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,2,"Perhaps the most disappointing thing about this book was the back-of-the-book blurb. Because, well, pretty much every word of the blurb is a lie. When you read it, you're filled with a desperate sense of urgency, the sense that at the outset of the book Vanyel is already extremely powerful and dangerous and gets sent to his aunt so that she main contain his power. Not so. In fact, it is no great spoiler to say that half the book passes with Vanyel being a simple whiny powerless boy, and he is sen"

A lot of reviews say that people liked this when they read it as a teen, and I guess I might have too because it sounds like a 13-year-old girl writing about her OCs. Not attractive at this point in my life. There are so many things that annoyed me about this book, and most of it came down to the author's writing style. How has she published so many books?! First, I'd say 90% of this book is long, boring, fake sounding di"

It's easily the worst of the Last Herald-Mage trilogy, in my opinion. I would hesitate to pick it up again. I loathed Vanyel in this book. He spends roughly an eternity being an irritating, whiny little brat. I did not care about him or what happened to him. It was not a good way to start off my time with his character. Lackey might think Vanyel and Tylendel"

I haven't read any of them in years, but when cleaning some books out of my dad's house recently, I came across these and thought I should go ahead and see what all the fuss was about. Exactly how good WAS 15 year-old me's taste? Well, in this particular instance, Teener Christiner was justified. This book held up awfully well. Is it perfect? No, not at all. But good, yes,"

I suspect if I'd read this book as a teenager I'd have loved it, and read the rest of the series and defended it against all comers in later life. In all honesty, for all I'm about to lambast it, it probably would have made me a better adjusted, more openminded person if I had read it as a teen. Unfortunately I read this one as an adult, and whilst I can switch off my brain and enjoy t"
8364,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,"My favorite thing about this book is how Vanyel's arc is more emotional than...magical? The rising action, climax, falling action, and denouement are all about Vanyel learning how to feel and mostly how to express his emotions in a healthy manner. You don't see a lot of high fantasies that are more about the hero growing more mentally healthy than more magical, or more of a warrior, or more of a ruler. Vanyel is also the most realistic depressed and insecure teenager I've ever read. He cries, he"

I picked this up expecting a few things: 1) A coming of age tale. 2) more destruction due to Vanyel's powers. Book description misleading much? 3) A plot. While happy I didn't get to deal with yet another Luke Skywalker copy, I found Vanyel frustrating to deal with. I felt the narrative spent too much time on the emotional turmoil is going on inside Vanyel's head to the po"

My first book was Black Gryphon and to this day it's one of my favorites as well as the Winds series with Elspeth and Darkwind. That being said I'm glad I waited to really dive head first into this trilogy until much later in life.

It's also been several years since I read The Queen's Own trilogy (my introduction to Valdemar) so I was a bit hazy going into this book about where we sat on the timeline. I never did sort that out until I consulted the interwebs after I finished and discovered this trilogy is set well before The Queen's Own. No problem. It stands just fine on its own.

I enjoyed another of her trilogies, so I wanted to like this one too, but I just couldn't. Nothing happens. I am four chapters in and it is utterly bland. Most of it can be conveyed in about a paragraph and still nothing useful has happened. Lackey does not show; she tells.

This book was actually sold in bookstores, next to other fantasy books, not relegated to an out-of-site LGBT shelf. I'm going to assume that this book was ahead of its time when it came out because of its main character. However, I just have to say, give Vanyel a break. Why is it such a trope that LGBT characters have to suffer. I can't believe how"

I like the style of writing in these books, it doesn't just focus on the action side of the story but also the emotional side too.

To be honest, this book was too...depressing and annoying to read at times. WOW! this book totally went downhill for me the moment whats-his-face died. I'm so over authors who kill off important characters for the sake of being edgy and dramatic. You know what's edgy? Bringing back the dead."
8376,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,"I first read this series in high school, and at the time I adored it. (ADORED with bells on.) When I read it then, I identified with Vanyel. I couldn't understand why the adults in his life were urging him to be his own person so much, to get some boundaries. I'd huff angrily about how they didn't understand, they just didn't! And of course my heart broke and I wept like a child at certain moments. Re-reading it now, I identify with Vanyel's aunt, Savil, and I'm completely on board with all the"

Some of the reviews here are all ""oh, it's so melodramatic and angsty"" and yeah, my dudes. It totally is. And that's why I LOVED IT.

But once I realized that this is a different world, I was able to concentrate on Vanyel. Lackey does a fantastic job of describing what goes on in a sixteen-year-old's world when no one understands him or listens to him, not atypical of teenagers everywhere. Vanyel's case is even worse than most, since he has a dysfunctional family with unrealistic expectations. Unfortunatel"

It felt very scattered, like King didn't really have any idea what the next paragraph would hold. I'm sure that probably made it a blast to write, but it could've been better if it wasn't quite so disjointed. The dialogue between characters is Star Wars Episode II level bad, unfortunately.

He seems unable to conceive of what I might call ""actual good"" or ""altruistic good"". His protagonists are usually terribly (even fatally) flawed in some critical way. In this I don't mean the in the ""I'm human with feet of clay"" type of flaw"
8411,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,"I’m a sucker for origin stories. In fact, this is the third time I’ve read this book. I’ve read The Fellowship of the Ring and watched the movie multiple times, but I’ve only read and seen the others once. I love watching Marvel movies, especially when the movie is just an origin story of a super hero. I love the first Harry Potter book where you get to learn all about Hogwarts and the amazing characters in that world. In fact, I love origin stories so much that I usually just stop there and don"
8412,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,"Stephen King's early books and films introduced me to the world of horror fiction when I was twelve, but recent works of his have begun to point to writing for profit rather than passion, and his books are getting more vulgar and less scary. However, The Gunslinger breaks through every one of his usual tropes as a fantasy novel rather than the usual Maine horror tale, and it has excellent imagery, unforgettable characters and a complex plot. Even if you're not a fan of horror, if you like fantas"
8413,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,1,"I really, really , really did not enjoy this. Reading this book was like having a one sided conversation with a relative who just won't shut up about something. They waffle on, they go on tangents, and you really want to get up and get a drink, make dinner, do some laundry.... Anything except continue to listen to the madness inducing dribble that they keep spouting. But for the sake of manners and propriety you have to endure the endless tirade even though you'd rather stab yourself in the face"

This was a BR that went haywire for me bcz, well, bcz real life! I apologize to the last man standing and I hope the next one would be better. I have had the pleasure of reading some good authors and a few great authors. I think I am a budding reader and yet, one thing I have noticed from day one, especially when I picked my first book from SK, Mr. Mercedes, was that for me, there a"
8416,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,2,"WrensReads Review: I’m just going to be completely honest: Stephen King’s writing just isn’t for me. I have read two different novels of his now, and I just get bored by his writing. The stories are legit and he is a great story teller, but his writing just isn’t for me. I am excited for the movie though. I am a fan of Stephen King’s stories and the film adaption. Have you seen that beautiful trailer? Like my word I can’t even. I am so pumped for that.

8417,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,"The fastest way to get me to start a series is by making a Hollywood movie of it, and subsequently come up with a trailer just packed with cool, slow-motion-like action scenes. Now keep in mind that I did say fastest , not surefire . In the case of Mortal Instruments for example, I was perfectly content to giggle over its cheesiness at the movies, without any further attempts at self-flagellation. Then again, which idiot in its right mind would put Stephen King and Cassandra Clare in the same sent"

You get “The Gunslinger” the first book in Stephen King’s Magnum Opus “The Dark Tower Series.” This will be the third time I’ve read “The Gunslinger,” and each time I read it the more I appreciate it.

Honestly, I don’t think it adds much to the table. (view spoiler) [ I mean, he follows The Man in Black, he meets Jake, betrays Jake and then catches the Man in Black, but not really.

I didn't like it. I didn't like the atmosphere, I didn't like the strange dialogue, I didn't like the ending for Jack - I had read a lot of King and this just was different for me. Rereading it now, on the cusp of 40, I loved it. I love the atmosphere, I love Roland, I understand what happened to Jack, I understand where this is going. The"
8421,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,"Seriously?! How did I miss this? This is iconic! Some books are like relationships, the timing has to be right. I remember picking this book up years (decades!) ago and thinking it was really not for me and what could Stephen King have been thinking... With the benefit of hindsight I am now wondering how I could have been so dismissive...amazing what a few decades of developing your literary tastes can do to change your mind... I read another book recently, The Vagrant, which I also loved. I caugh"
8422,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,"This is simply one of the best books of 2017. The Gunslinger, the first book in the Dark Tower series, is simple but holds so much depth in it, and that depth comes with the writing being so poetic and delicious. One of my favorite parts in this book was the relationship that connected Roland to Jake, and vice-versa; that friendship and the father-son-like relationship never ceased to make me feel heart-warmed and happy, since both of them completed what the other lacked. I literally couldn't stop"
8423,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,2,I fully reserve the right to change this to a 2* or a 4* depending on the next book in the series. EDIT: After nearly completing book two I'm dropping this to 2.5*'s On the one hand this book was a myriad of shit with no real plot. On the other hand there were some brilliant scenes and foreboding to a richer story to be told through the series. Some of the interplanetary and multidimensional theories all leading to the dark tower were very intriguing. As were the old age battle between good and e
8424,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,"You can find my review on my blog by clicking here . This is my first experience of Stephen King’s work. I am myself surprised that it isn’t one of his pure horror stories, but I also had a feeling I was going to end up exploring the Dark Tower universe before anything else. With an adaptation in the work, starring both Matthew McConaughey and Idris Elba—two formidable actors, might I add—I vowed I’d get my hands on this series before indulging the movie. The first book in this series, The Gunslin"
8425,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,"How perfect is Avenged Sevenfold's Gunslinger for this book? Buddy read with Vanessahhh ...Right, to the review then. Whatever Stephen King was on when he wrote The Gunslinger, I will have some of it. This was completely cray, not a least bit sorry for it and I loved it. As the cover will clue one in, this is a western-themed fantasy. There's a gunslinger, Roland Deschain and a world that has moved on , a bleak world on the brink of destruction, swallowed up by sand and devil grass. Roland Deschain"
8427,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,"This is my Book Of the Month- June 2017, with GR group- Nothing But Reading Challenges- Category: Adult Sci-Fi/Fantasy BOM. I had no idea that Stephen King can write something like this. Don't get me wrong, Stephen King in my mind is synonym with Horror so I was surprised with the premise of this book. A cowboy fantasy novel set in a dystopian world. What more could I ask for!! While reading this book, I had strong impression of watching a classic Hollywood cowboy movie and then something creepy w"
8428,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,2,"Dear reader: I am a Stephen King fan; I’ve read about a dozen of his works, including some of his horror books, his non-horror and even his recent detective trilogy. But everyone says The Dark Tower books are his magnum opus. And so I picked up The Gunslinger . People warned me that the short book was slow, confusing, badly written and that the series REALLY began with book two, The Drawing Of The Three . But I’m a completist. If I’m even a minute late for a movie, I won’t watch it; I’ll also stay t"
8429,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,"I've seen a few reviews that seemed to indirectly question whether King was on crack while he wrote this. I thought they were being ridiculous but now, I can see the reasons. This book is so weird that I don't even think I can write a proper coherent review without not making sense of myself. If there are two things I'd describe The Gunslinger , it would be vague and odd as fuck. Reading this was like trying to piece together all the scattered jigsaw puzzles. It urges you to use your brain and fit"
8431,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,2,"I just could not get into this book. It started out good for me but I don't know. I liked some things about it but the rest I felt like I wasn't getting what was going on. I'm not going to give up on the series though, I'm going to read it and I'm going to re-read this book when I can because I want to make sure it wasn't just my mood or what as I love most of King's books. I'm going to re-read a lot of his stuff I haven't read since a child and new stuff. I never got to read this series and I re"
8432,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,"After re-reading the Gunslinger for the (third time?) I'm issuing an official statement that nobody is allowed to say this is the weakest book in the series from here on out! First, I'm reading the newer 2003 edition that includes an intro from King called, ""On Being Nineteen"" which made me cry. Then, I was quickly immersed into Mid-World with Roland, my all time favorite literary boyfriend. I can't believe how much I've missed on prior readings! It sounds weird but this time, I really focused on w"

Stephen King our modern day Charles Dickens takes you on beginning of an epic journey with Roland 'The Gunslinger' in this poignant tale. The story takes us through the past and future and the coming of age of a man and a boy in search of The Tower.

8434,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,2,"“Do any men grow up or do they only come of age?” I probably read this wrong, full disclosure. I would be willing to revisit this after finishing the series, maybe. It's not often that a book makes me feel truly stupid, but this one did. I've heard that it takes a reread after completing the series to get more than a mild dislike out of this book, but I've also heard one shouldn't over-analyze and should just go with the flow. I've heard other people found it cryptic, while others found it most"
8435,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,"Surprise, really, is the best way to describe how I felt about this book. I devoured this book in less than a day. In an afternoon, really. And I'm totally surprised by how much I enjoyed it. And joy really is the word - I smiled all the way through, and here's why: I don't know if it was because of my English-major background, my youthful ""superiority"", or my high-brow vanity, but I had Stephen King pegged as a for-the-thrills, no-substance writer, based on nothing other than my own notions. He"
8436,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,"Re-read Review: 6/6/2017 ★★★☆☆ After receiving some private messages and strong encouragement and motivation from trustworthy goodreads members, I decided to do my re-read sooner rather than later. Yes...I did my re-read the very next day. I figured the story was fresh and I was doing yardwork rather than paperwork so my change in multitasking duties may make a difference. For me, it did. I actually was able to follow the characters and chain of events, as disjointed as they may be at times. But I"
8437,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,"So maybe you've heard this old story about how to boil a frog. You dump a frog in boiling water, he's going to jump right out. You put cool water in the pot with lil froggie and slowly heat it up while he's inside? Maybe he won't sit there and boil to death. He'll jump out eventually if things get too hot. But he's gonna stay in there a good long while if you play your cards right. It's a useful little anecdote; can be used for all sorts of fun metaphorical purposes. For instance, I believe I on"
8438,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,I'm not big into sci-fi but this one was better than I expected. A little dark . A little monochromatic. But King does a great job of getting you to understand and believe in his characters. This is really a 3 1/2 star novel with 5 star writing.
8440,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,2,"I have heard a lot of hype about this book and a lot of my friends are really into it. I saw the paperback cheap at a used book store and decided to pick up the first two in the series. I am probably never going to touch the second book. I have never been a fan of Stephen King, I don't really like horror books and I really don't understand how many times you can read about a car killing people before you get bored of the man. The reason I read this is because the Marvel comic version of this is r"
8441,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,2,"The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed. As he makes his way across this vast, bleak and desolate landscape, he meets people, has sex, forms friendships. Bullets fly……people die. The gunslinger has bad, equally bleak and desperate dreams and flashbacks. The man in black eludes him. For me the best part of this story was the conversation between Roland (the gunslinger) and Walter (the man in black) near the end of this segment of the journey and King’s own afterword. No"
8442,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,"Recently, my comrades in literature featured a Dark Tower conversation on (prepare for shameless plug) Shelf Inflicted . Unfortunately, I was unable to participate because I had not yet read the series. It felt a little like being the uncool kid who gets picked last for kickball. I decided it was time to remedy this. I was going to prove I could kick that damn ball. Now I have made vague promises for years to them and to others that, yes, I would read the book and I was sure that I would love it."
8443,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,"“The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.” Only Mr. King can compose a book of magic, mystery and combine it so well with horror details. He's a master story-teller and by now I believe he can write just about anything and still make you stare at the book in awe. The book starts off with Roland stalking the man in black in a black and desolate desert which is the book's setting, mostly.. We have no clue whatsoever about the world we're reading about, or the character"
8444,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,"The Dark Tower has to be one of the strangest and most mystifying series I’ve read, I think, probably ever. And this review is coming months late—I’ve already read the full series—so I know. In it’s entire, the book is completely different in style, totally unpredictable in plot, and simply put, just a mesmerizing story. The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed. So, there lies the iconic first sentence starting Stephen King’s immensely famed fantasy series. How perfe"
8446,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,1,"What I learned from this book: The gunslinger is the gunslinger. The gunslinger slings guns. The gunslinger loves to shoot people. The gunslinger does this thingie with his fingers to load his guns. The gunslinger fucks women when they ask him nicely. The gunslinger rolls his own cigarettes. The gunslinger takes LSD, not because he likes it, but because he has to. The gunslinger needs to get to The Man In Black. DARK TOWER DARK TOWER DARK TOWER DARK TOWER BATWING! The Gunslinger almost dies. The gu"
8447,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,"A fair introduction to my very first Stephen King novel. The Gunslinger is a mix of Tolkien 's grandeur and the Western elements of The Good, The Bad and The Ugly . The first volume of The Dark Tower is a maze of pretty vocabulary. Quite hard to get into at first. Ironically, Mr. King himself said that the revised editions are easier to read. Imagine how far more difficult it would have been to read the original text. It is gushing with bizarre characters scattered on a labyrinthine narrative. Des"
8448,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,"I’ve always heard great things about this series, so when my bestie and her brother invited me to do a buddie read I jumped on i! So glad I did. I had to remind myself to keep plugging along “I’m sure this will become clearer as I go.” And it did. Not that there aren’t questions about the bigger picture, but for this particular book I’m satisfied. But that’s why it’s a SERIES right?"
8449,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,2,"Well, it's unfortunate that this was my first Stephen King book. I've seen so many of the movies adapted from his books, so I was well aware that he has a different imagination but this was just weird and not very enjoyable for me. It was dark, emotionless and vague. I know this is the weakest of the series. King admits it himself in the foreward, but it's highly doubtful I will continue. On a positive note, there's a movie adaption to be released some time this year so there's that at least."
8450,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,1,Ok so I've always thought Stephen King was wonderful...however I can't see it in this book. Like a weird guy on drugs wrote it. I don't think I'll try the rest of this series.
8451,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,"“The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.” And so it begins. I have ventured along the Path of the Beam many a times with Roland. The Dark Tower Series is one of my all-time favorites and it is hard to review the Gunslinger as a stand-alone book. But, I will try. I had attempted to read the Gunslinger 4 times….that’s right, you read that correctly. I loved Stephen King and could not understand why I couldn’t get through this book. I would get to the same point every ti"
8452,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,"I feel very, very guilty about my 25+ years of smug dismissal of Stephen King. It took GR friends with impeccable taste in lit to show me the errors of my ways. Mr. King, I apologize. You really know how to write a brilliant page-turning story. I read this book aloud to the misses and it was only the second book I've read to her that she simply wouldn't let me stop (the other: Hyperion ). The rich, relatable and broken characters; the unfolding world that seems recognizable, but isn't; poignant wr"
8453,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,I loved this book. It got me hooked on the series. Re-read 6/3/17-6/4/17 I had forgotten how much this book foreshadows the series. All the clues to the ending were right there from the beginning. It really was brilliant to have those seeds planted so early before the other books were even fully formed. I may need to re-read the whole series now.
8454,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,"How does one even being to rate, much less review, Stephen King's magnum opus? If one rates it highly, can one be sure they are not rating it for what it is, instead of for the words themselves? Or if one rates it lowly, can one be sure that is not just the same reaction in the opposite direction? Where expectations have soared so high, heaven itself could not satisfy? So let us instead speak of simpler things than trying to sway you into making this an inclusion on your TBR shelf. The man in bla"

A little young, one might say, but I was always precocious and my family threw adult fantasy/science fiction at me from all sides (not that I minded - I always caught the books) . But I hadn't been so immersed in a book since The Lord of the Rings and was so fascinated by what my friend had given me - she had introduced me to Stephen King, not as the Lord of Horror but as the Lord of Dark Fantasy. And I am still entranced to this day. Thanks again Gabe, for introduci"

Now (almost) 5 year later I'm reading it for the 3rd time as part of Emily Cait 's DTProject2017, a project were we are going to read one book every month until July, the month when the"
8459,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,"This book is a very odd book and I find Stephen king's writing style strange. It is not what I expect. I expect The Gunslinger book is more serious, mystery, dark and the plot of the storyline in the book is more mature. I didn't like the main character. I wonder how the story lead to The Dark Tower. I don't really enjoyed this book but I find the world in The Dark Tower really intriguing."

And even though the later novels have a decent mix of Sci-Fi and Horror thrown in, this first novel is set firmly in Fantasy/Western territory, so it fits our established genres. Also, most of the book club members had not yet read this one, and we wanted to rectify that oversight before the movie was released. And though we got decidedly mixed reviews within the g"

He started the epic in his youth, and worked on it for most of his literary career. Readers in general agree with him, and are generous with their praise for the gunslinger who chases the man in black.

As some might have noticed, I just finished re-reading The Stand and planned to take a short break and then re-read The Dark Tower series. Well, last weekend I noticed my buddy, Edward Lorn, starting a buddy read on the DT series on his Discussion Group and so I just had to dive right in.

While we were at the giftshop in Yellowstone I believe, I found the Gunslinger on one of those spinning racks. Stephen King is my favorite author so I immediately grabbed the book and bought it. That night I read the first page and thought...""Ew the main character is a cowboy!"" I put the book down and never picked it back up. Well 15 years later I decided to try again and boy am I happy I di"
8466,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,2,"This just didn't work for me! I was never able to get into this book as I was somewhat confused during the entire novel and the whole thing felt like a vague, hazy dream. I feel like there was some sort of underlying metaphor I was suppose to get and connections that I was suppose to make that I just didn't. Looking forward to the next one since it sounds like it's easier to read!"

8468,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,"I read the first half of this when I was in seventh grade. I bought over a dozen Stephen King books at a garage sale and laid out a plan to complete the entire Stephen King catalogue. This was even more foolish than my more recent attempt to read the entirety of In Search of Lost Time in one year. Not, of course, that it can’t be done, only that I have proven myself—over and over again—incapable of following through with my grandiose plans, however comparatively-to-others’ modest they may be.

8472,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,"Slightly less enjoyable fifth time around. I've come to hate the final scenes of this book. I understand the subtext and the foreshadowing and blah blah blah, but it's just not enjoyable to read. This coming from someone, as I just said, who's read it five times. Still, the Battle of Tull, the fight with the slow mutants, and Jake's fate, will remain close to my heart forevermore.

The first time, I was young, younger than I like to remember, and a great deal of this book was lost on me. The second time I read it was in 2004, after King finished the series by releasing the final three books in a marathon sprint. My views of the second read and this read-through are about the same. I have a clear favorite in this"
8474,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,2,"Rather than a standalone book, I view this more of a long prologue to the series. I learned a lot about the Gunslinger and his history. My only problem with the book (and let's face it, it was a pretty big problem to lose two stars over), is the confusing writing. King is creative. His stories are engaging. But sentences were choppy and he kept jumping from topic to topic without any conclusion. I was left wondering what exactly happened in some instances (eg:- demon baby moment). As a prologue"
8475,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,"The Gunslinger is unlike anything I have ever read. Upon reading The Gunslinger, I really did not know what The Dark Tower series was about, and the first installment to The Dark Tower series really gives you an idea of who the Gunslinger is, how he sets out on this journey, and finally, what his mission is. I really enjoyed several parts in this book. I've seen a lot of negative criticism about The Gunslinger, and quite honestly, I'm the type to give a book a chance and not let anyone else's fe"
8479,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,"Let me say something first. There's really no point in reading any Stephen King story if you don't read ""The Dark Tower"" series first. I'm very serious about this. Every short story, every sentence in one of his huge novels will resonate so much more if you read these novels outright. Because King is a geek of the best kind - he writes for his fans, who are as obsessed, if not more, with the world of the Dark Tower. And so every story has a shout-out - whether it be momentary, or whether it prac"
8481,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,"2015 - I loved the subtle world building that King did in The Gunslinger. He plops us down in Roland's world and gives us little bits of info here and there to piece together where he is. He shows us a world with a long history not unlike ours, but more parallel than linear. I love the idea of a world ""moving on"". A bit like ""the heavyside lair"" or Tolkien's idea for his worlds. It verges on high fantasy, but also has bits of reality, western, horror, almost everything. We see Roland in a very unf"

8484,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,So I read this a couple weeks ago and am only just now getting around to writing the review. I'm a little surprised at my rating. I wasn't in love with this one. I watched the movie when it came out this summer and while I didn't think it was anything exceptional it felt like a better rendition of King's work than so many other movies based on his books. I guess the misunderstanding on my part was that the movie covered all of The Dark Tower books? While I'm sure there are many wonderful parts o
8485,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,"The Gunslinger by Stephen King is the first King novel that I've read.

I know a lot of you warned me that the book is confusing and I thank you for that because if I hadn't known that many of you also found it hard too I might have given up on the book. At first I was really liking The Gunslinger. We start off by meeting the gunslinger, Roland, whilst he is in the m"
8487,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,"This book has unexpected depth, for me at least. This was my first book by Stephen King, so maybe this is normal for him. I am talking about the multi layered way of writing and story telling. The way the world is described and created is well done and often by stories the Gunslinger tells others. The sentences are holding so much that I had to reread them multiple times more than once and I am sure I still didn't get everything. I like that there are still so many things unclear and not everything"
8488,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,First King book I've managed to finish and it was ... ok. 😕🤷 I didn't think it was bad but I wasn't really wowed. Does this series get better or should I prepare myself for more of the same?
8490,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,"8/10 The opening paragraph to The Gunslinger was so embedded into my mind already, purely down to a number of friends/other reviewers on Goodreads, that a metaphorical shiver went down my spine when it was finally my time to read it and begin the journey to the Tower. By no means is this a perfect novel, or even one of King’s better outings from the few I’ve read, but it is the promise of what is to come which adds to the enjoyment here. Instantly you are drawn into Roland’s quest and quickly give"
8491,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,"I can officially say that I've read a book by Stephen King. If you're wondering, I committed a sin in the eyes of a book lover - I watched the film before I read the book. I KNOW RIGHT! That's totally not me at all! The reason why I did was because I know how many mixed reviews the beginning of this series gets. I didn't know whether I'd be motivated to read and proceed with this series if I didn't have interest in the world. That is why I chose to watch the movie beforehand. I went into it with no"
8492,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,"Two Good Things-- George Guidall, the narrator, has the perfect voice for The Gunslinger. He has the gravel of too many cigarettes and too much bourbon. But along with the roughness of his vocal cords is an ability to feel the text and convey that feeling, making the story of such unrepentantly awful characters something I wanted to hear even though I can't give a shit about them. Stephen King's fantasy epic, set in something resembling our world, contains the kind of sprawling, insane mythology t"

8496,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,"Most people, when they consider The Dark Tower as a whole, often think of it in terms of being perhaps the height of achievement in Stephen King's career. And while I can count many favorites among King's seemingly endless bodies of work, I'm inclined to agree. The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed. Of course, one must take into consideration some of his most notable works such as The Shining, It, The Stand, and even some of his Bachman books, The Dark Tower stil"

8498,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,"My impression of Stephen King's magnum opus, The Gunslinger, went through the entire gamut of human emotions. My initial feelings were as follows: confusion, utter and total confusion. Yet it had a cool vibe, so I felt compelled to continue. Then sprinkle on some happiness, sorrow, further confusion, boredom, and indifference. Blend thoroughly with awe, surprise, additional confusion, inspiration, confusion, massive excitement and hope. Finish with confusion. It was a short read and my friends ha"

It's hard to make sense of, hard to get into. So I recommend this to you with my highest praise, but I'm warning/advising you--stick with it. It will be worth it in the end. I promise. Anyhow.

8500,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,"To be honest, I’ve never been a big fan of Stephen King. I’ve always felt that he’s a far better storyteller than an actual writer and this book does little to change that opinion. In fact, the book’s prose style seems even clumsier than King’s usual, mostly adequate standard. Given the fact that the book started out as a fix-up novel consisting of 5 short stories published between 1978 and 1981, it stands to reason that it would suffer a bit from a young writer’s inexperience. The narrative is"

I'm not sure whether I find that hilarious or if it makes me want to cry. *********************************** This is my least favorite chapter of the Dark Tower saga. It's written in a completely different style (probably mostly because it was written when King was 19, and the others much later), and I prefer the rest of the books to it. That being said, this is still an all-consuming book, and will suck in the reader from the very beginn"
8502,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,"Intriguing! I know this is the first of seven books, so there is still a lot of story left, but I'm hooked so far. In the forward, Stephen King says this is his ""Lord of the Rings"" and it definitely is a fantasy, but it still has that King flavor of horror, which makes me happy! I look forward to ""The Drawing of the Three""! Update 8/01/15 I'm sticking with four stars. As a devoted fan of SK, I'm aware that I've just taken the first couple of steps on what promises to be a magical journey, but at t"
8504,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,2,"Well... the jury's still out on this one. But my overall impression was ""Uh...."" I decided to read this book because one of the executive producers of Lost (which I love) loved this series. And I tend to like the fantasy quest type thing... so I had high expectations for Stephen King's Dark Tower series. But this book was... weird. And icky. There was a lot of sex in this book that I found completely unnecessary, unenjoyable and kind of gross. And the protagonist is not particularly sympathetic..."
8505,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,2,"Ok, so I know this is supposed to be some great work of King's, however, I really had a hard time getting into this. I'm not a fan of Westerns for starters. I frequently felt like I didn't know what was going on. Not until the end did it seem to become interesting . I'll likely finish the series because of all the connections to other works of King though."
8508,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,"Note: This was my very first review on Booklikes. The Gunslinger is definitely an oddity in Stephen King's list of written works -- it's trippy, cold, and a bit confusing for newcomers to the Dark Tower series. King's typical style is more warm and inviting, comparable to a longtime friend putting his arm around your shoulder and telling you a tale you just gotta hear. The first novel in the Dark Tower sequence isn't like that, thus it tends to be rather divisive in Stephen King fan communities."
8509,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,"I know that it's taken me a long time to get around to this book. I can explain. Back when Wizard and Glass came out, I was on a major King spree. I read nothing but King for over three months, nearly everything he'd written to that point. I overdosed. And I excused passing over this series because it wasn't finished yet. Maybe King would get hit by a van and wouldn't be able to finish it. Since then, King has both been hit by a van and finished the series, so I have no excuse. And after reading"
8510,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,"The chief influence for CTHULHU ARMAGEDDON, The Gunslinger remains arguably my all time favorite novel. It is strange because it is not actually as detailed as most of Stephen King's work. Instead, it is a long dream-like work which opens on an alien but familiar world that has elements of the Wild West mixed with Fantasy but also our world. It is a classic tale of archetypes with Roland the Gunslinger on a mission of revenge against the Man in Black. Along the way, he'll do horrible things whil"
8511,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,2,"The imagery in this novel is awesome. The bulk of the story is in a western style post apocalyptic desert. There's saloons, gun fights and creepy abandoned towns. The Gunslinger also had flashbacks that took us to some kind of medieval-style fantasy world and we even meet a character that took us back to current time New York. I couldn't figure out how they all fit together though. I spent most of this story trying to piece together details to help me figure out the plot. Roland, The Gunslinger,"
8513,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,"4.5 stars. Rating subject to change because I LOVED this book but I don't think I should give it five stars. So there are two reasons I'm happy to finish this book. One - It was really fabulous and I loved every single second of it. Two - I can stop getting Tom Petty's ""Two Gunslingers"" stuck in my head every time I notice it in my audible app. :) The imagination and bizarre mix of mythology/science/world building in this book were truly remarkable and a bit eclectic.

8514,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,2,"The universe is the Great All, and offers a paradox too great for the finite mind to grasp. As the living brain cannot conceive of a nonliving brain—although it may think it can—the finite mind cannot grasp the infinite. The prosaic fact of the universe’s existence alone defeats both the pragmatist and the romantic. I wonder And then some I am still wondering Nope!

8515,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,2,"The gunslinger said nothing. The boy said nothing. The gunslinger was silent, thoughtful. The man in black was silent for a while. The gunslinger made no reply. Thomas failed once again to see the greatness of this book. Parts are brilliant of course, the time spent in (and especially the killing of) Tull is very effective storytelling and riveting reading. The world building is often good (even if I like it better when very little is revealed, rather than when things get more explained). But most els"
8516,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,1,"It may surprise some that I'm giving Stephen King a one-star review, but I thought about it, and I have to be fair. If any other author had written this, I probably would have stopped reading it before the end and would have had no problem giving it one star. Because it was King, I rushed through the ending, just so I could be done with it. I found this book poorly written, and the plot pointless. A gunslinger is hunting a man in black (so obviously he's evil) in a land where they sing ""Hey, Jud"
8519,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,"3.5 out of 5 stars I was unsure whether to round this to 3 or to 4 because I didn't exactly love this book, yet I still liked it.

Honestly, I only *sort of* figured this book out today- after watching a 30-second trailer for the movie."
8522,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,"3/6 - I thought the pacing of this was slow, sure there were periods of furious activity (the battle of Tull, etc.), but as soon as they were over it was back to stolidly plodding along (in terms of both pace and what was happening in the plot). I felt confused for most of the 238 pages of the book and was left with many, many questions. Some, admittedly, were a bit stupid, but I just didn't 'get' what was happening in the scenes while I was reading them. Exactly what was a gunslinger, what was"
8523,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,"The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed. Right, to be perfectly candid, this is really not a five-star book, far from that. it's more like a 2.5 or so. Same goes for the final installment in the series, which features the most fucked up, dullest, stupidest, crappiest ending ever. [*] ""The Dark Tower"" (the series, I mean) is all about the journey. And the journey itself is a pretty amazing one, hence the five star rating, given this is the beginning of a spectacular"

On top of that, I have been told for years what a wonderful series “The Dark Tower” is, so I was very excited to finally have the time to commit myself to reading it. But after forcing myself to get through the first instalment, I have to say this is the most disappointing book I have probably ever read. I reall"

While you might think that us watching a movie together had nothing to do with this book, it does. I hated that movie. I made Chantel laugh by thanking the bad guys for killing people off. That movie had a pointless plot. There were no compelling characters. I knew no names. And it took ages to get to the point. Much like this book. While it's only 250 pages for my copy, it took me so"

This was my first King book and although I found it to be enjoyable whilst I was reading it, I as left with a hundred questions which increased as the book went on which ended up slightly putting me off picking it back up once I had put it down. I liked the character of Roland, he seemed to have a clear goal and be a very direct person. I felt that he was likeable and dis"
8527,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,"I approached this series with some trepidation because it's a bit of a commitment and I have long standing issues with commitment. I've gone some way to curing that by managing a semblance of dedication when it comes to GRRM's A Song of Fire and Ice series (or GoT if you will) although that said, the last two books in the series are currently languishing unread at the side of my bed.

Though I am happy that I started the series, it wasn't the best first book out there. The plot and the way the story was told was confusing at times. We would go between past and present, and I did not care for hearing about his past events, I found them quite dull to be honest. I liked the main character but didn't love him. I feel like I didn't form an attachment to him that well. I really liked the boy Jake thou"
8529,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,1,"This one really wasn't for me. I found it confusing and it didn't flow. I didn't hate it but there were far too many occasions when I really had no clue as to what was going on, or what the actual story was supposed to be about. I've said before that I'm not a fan of overly descriptive passages and this book has them in abundance. I often got the impression that the author had a thought and then threw the words onto the page (it certainly read that way to me). I really hope that the other books"
8530,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,"That was an odd read—not bad, just odd. Like King just threw in any old idea he came up with and didn’t bother editing later. I could appreciate that he chose the Western form to jolt readers away from comparisons with Donaldson’s Thomas Covenant or Brooks’ Shannara series. But make no mistake, this is a quest-tale, not searching for the Holy Grail, but seeking the Black Tower. The symbolism is all over the place—lots of Biblical references, Tarot, a few to King Arthur, probably some that went ri"
8531,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,"Well, I don't know what to think of The Gunslinger, although I also cannot think of a rating other than four stars. It would have been a five if the sacrifice had been more gory and more sanguine instead of being disappointing and underwhelming. Now I know that Stephen King is an author who thrives in death. His least bloody book that I've read, Dolores Claiborne, was a letdown. The lack of magic in that book did not help. Now, I know the second and third books in this series are better than th"

8534,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,"Reread July 2016 I've been meaning to re-read the series as for some reason the story didn't stick with me through all these years (8 if my memory serves me right). So, the journey began when King was very young and this clearly shows in his writing. Still, I found it a perfect kick off for what I consider one of the best fantasy stories ever told."
8535,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,"*3.5 out of 5 stars* I've read my fair share of Stephen King novels, but this one was by far the strangest. Riddled with odd arrangements of sentences and weird descriptions, ""The Gunslinger"" was, at times, incredibly hard to follow. However, that amazing ending and the hope that the rest of the series will be better is pushing me to pick up the second installment!"
8537,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,"First book in the Dark Tower Series. It serves as an introduction to the tale to come, sets the mood and introduces the hard hitting main character - the Gunslinger. I really liked the book - but the best is yet to come. Make sure you read the rest of the series!!!"
8538,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,1,I don't wanna talk about it. I'm just gonna block this book out. Act like it never happened.
8539,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,"4.5/5. This was fantastic on so many levels. King builds an intriguing world, equal parts ominous and ethereal. I am so excited for the rest of this series! Already ordered the second book :)"
8540,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,"This is was I was looking for, but didn't find, when I read The Stand. My curiosity is piqued. Bring on the next book!"
8542,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,"4.5/5 Brilliant. I'm elated to finally be reading this series!!! Loved the last few dozen pages, especially. King IS a Master, no doubt about that. And finished just in time for the release of Jemisin's final Broken Earth book!!! Highly recommended. Happy reading to all. And a quick word about George Guidall's narration: What a wonderful portrayal of this classic. Splendid choice!"
8543,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,"I have to admit it: when I started reading this one, I wasn’t so sure I was going to finish it. In fact, in the Foreword to this new, revised edition, the author mentions that he felt the urge to often apologize to readers for the way the first edition of The Gunslinger was written, saying it did not sound like the later books, encouraging them to be perseverant and keep on reading a story that would only find its voice in the following books. Of course, he was talking about the non-revised firs"
8544,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,"This is going to be a short review with random thoughts. I can’t seem to organize my thoughts about this book. King does a great job laying the groundwork to open this seven-book series. The Gunslinger may be a short novel, but it’s packed full of vivid imagery and a blend of unique characters. My version of the paperback had 327 pages consisting of five long chapters. Honestly, I was expecting more to happen and at times the book felt longer. There were a few exciting, action-packed scenes invol"
8546,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,1,"Aw shit. That is my first thought after reading this. I have a future discussion to lead about this book, which I nominated. Well, at least I can watch Idris Elba next year playing Roland. Ok. There are too many genres rolled into one here. The stories are jumbled (parallel worlds? the Midworld is already too much) and confused me alot. Plus, too much travelogue for my taste. Despite some admittedly beautiful proses, it was mostly dreary and cathartic. As for characters, I did not develop any affi"
8547,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,"I can't tell you how many times I've read this book, it's a lot. I can tell you that the first time I read this I was so very, very confused. My mum and my brother were both reading the series and they convinced me to keep going. It sounds very generic to say ""I'm glad I did"", but I am. If I had to rate this book without knowing the details of the rest, it would probably get 2 stars. 1 because it's Stephen King and the other because it has potential. And lordy does it have potential. But I HAVE r"

I didn't find this book difficult, but it sure is odd. (I had to keep reminding myself that this is a Stephen King book and not Neil Gaiman!) I can see how Stephen King has such a huge following. I avoided his work for many years as I don't read horror, but every book of his that I have read has been amazingly well written ; great characters, well craf"
8551,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,"A decade ago, I tried this book on audio and had to dnf because I just couldn't get into it. But after hearing so many great things about the Dark Tower series, I finally decided to give it another go. This time, the reworked version. In the foreword, King states he made the text more readable, more accessible, by cutting out all the unnecessary parts that were a reflection of his younger self's more literary ambitions. Motive: he felt it was such a shame many people never got into the series be"
8552,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,"Congrats to me for finishing this time! So, if you're a King fan, which I definitely am, you're supposed to read this series. The trouble is you have to start with this book, which is boring as all hell. Still, it picks up about halfway through and becomes, not exciting, but intriguing. I'm ready for more!"
8553,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,2,Well that was an utter disappointment.

8555,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,This was not at all what I expected! I need to think on it for a bit. RTC.
8556,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,3.5 of 5 stars Never would've guessed this was written by King. A bit convoluted and hard to follow... wondering if it would have been different if I had read the revised version instead? Glad to have finally started this though and definitely plan to continue. Maybe not right away though. :)
8557,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,2,"Two stars may seem harsh, but it's all relative. And a two-starred King book is still better than many other books I've read. That said, The Gunslinger certainly does not rank highly on my list of King novels. To better understand why I didn't enjoy this book, I had to do a bit of research on the history of the first of the Dark Tower novels. This helped shed some light on why I didn't enjoy this read very much. Brief history lesson on the first Dark Tower novel, The Gunslinger: -It took Stephen K"
8558,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,"The Gunslinger Aside from beginning with one of the greatest first sentences in the history of literature (and something even more amazing*), the Gunslinger is the gateway to the Dark Tower series. And at the same time, it is a source of confusion, wonder, anger and all the rest. My belief is that this is because The Gunslinger is not really a novel. It’s a prolog. King himself in his intro to the updated version of the book says that The Dark Tower is really one long novel. So The Gunslinger is"
8559,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,"“The man in black fled across the desert, and the Gunslinger followed.” I have to start by saying this is my second read-through of The Dark Tower series. My second journey to the Tower is somehow even more enjoyable than the first. I’m thrilled I waited until my second read through to properly review the series, especially The Gunslinger! Confusing parts made so much more sense, and there are so many hints and subtle clues to what happens later in the series. Of course, I had to choose the most l"
8560,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,2,"I'm a fan of King's horror. The Shining is one of the best horror novels I've ever read. This ... this was something I just couldn't get into. The Gunslinger has one of the strongest opening lines I've seen in modern fiction: ""The Man in Black fled across the desert, and the Gunslinger followed."" It's stark, spare and evocative. It is, I think, written to mirror King's ideas for his main character. Unfortunately, the rest of the book can't match its opening line, and the character of Roland can't"
8561,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,"“Do any men grow up or do they only come of age?” or for that matter do they even come of age? Some boys never learn to be men, Steven Spielberg for example. But that's irrelevant unless Roland, the titular gunslinger, fails to learn anything through the remaining 6 main volumes and 2 half volumes. Stephen King has set it all up right from the first short story for this series to be an epic multiple genre blending bildungsroman. But do I care enough to carry on? Probably not to be honest. I have"
8562,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,"As I began making my way through King's entire catalogue back when I was 13 or so, I remember always skipping past the Dark Tower series because the premise never really appealed to me. Not only that, but that strange mutt genre mix of western/horror/fantasy did not sound especially inviting to a boy mostly steeped in science fiction written by Bear and Benford. Fast forward about 25 years or so and I have finally decided to read The Gunslinger. Even after all the warnings that this book was sort"
8563,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,"Pretty underwhelming to me for a celebrated series from a celebrated author. Perhaps it's because it was written when King was still young, or perhaps it's the nature of it as an origin story. Will proceed to the 2nd book to decide whether it's really my cup of tea or not"
8564,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,"Initially, I was fearful to write a review. So much has already been said about this book and, being a newby to the series, I didn't want to mess up any thoughts for fear of others telling me I'm wrong. I will just write a few words on my reaction to this book. I found parts of it extremely slow and confusing. It jumps around in time and events and I just couldn't grasp where it went and where it was going. At first I didn't understand who anyone was or what the point of the chase was. And who wa"
8565,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,"Phew, I’m done. Yep, finished reading my first ever Stephen King novel, The Gunslinger, it was a bit of a chore as I found it a little difficult to follow but that could have been my fault due to my mind wandering to all the many lovely fun and festive books I could’ve been reading, even so, if it had of kept my interest I guess my mind would not have wandered, nevertheless I did plod on as in some parts it became interesting and I could appreciate Stephen King’s great writing and I did want to"
8566,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,"Overall, this book was mostly what I was expecting it to be: A very long prologue. So, dont get me wrong. I really enjoyed it. I liked Roland as a character and I enjoyed reading about his search for The Man in Black, his interactions with Jake and the parts of his backstory which were interluded a few times within the book. However, I already heard from a lot of people that this first book would make perfect sense in retrospect when you finish the series but that it would feel mostly like an in"
8567,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,"The opening volume to King's fantasy opus could be looked upon as little more than a prologue to the epic tale that followed, but it remains one of my favourite entries in the series. Knightly gunslinger Roland is the product of an alternative feudal America, now fallen into a state of terminal decline. For reasons unknown Roland chases the man in black across this wasted landscape encountering predatory elementals and religiously deranged townsfolk along the way. Roland is a compelling an often"
8568,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,2,"A thoroughly uninteresting and unsatisfying book. Honesty, I only finished it because A) I'm curious to read the rest of the series since I've heard so many good things and B) I had no other audiobooks to listen to on my lengthy commute. This is the second King novel I've tried, and I still can't shake the small, dingy American town feel. It's bleak as hell, but not even good bleak. I did not care what was happening in the story for most of the novel. It was confusing and experimental to the detrim"
8569,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,"This is by no means the strongest volume in the series (nor my favourite) -- think The Hobbit in comparison to the rest of The Lord of the Rings -- but I gave it five stars anyway because it is the book that launched Roland on his unforgettable, addictive quest. It's a teaser, but absolutely integral to understanding everything that comes after. Don't miss that experience. And my absolute favourite opening line (say it with me Constant Readers): The man in black fled across the desert, and the gu"
8571,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,"I see a lot of complaining that it's slow and blah blah blah and that's valid but it's SHORT and you HAVE TO read it in order to continue with one of the greatest series' ever written so blah blah blah keep reading, it gets way better. Long days and pleasant nights!"
8574,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,"Wow, it's been a while since a book has left me in such a confused state. I've been aware of The Dark Tower series for years, but having found its epic-ness and length intimidating, I have only now made the move to read its first volume. But what the hell was it that I have just read? We follow the journey of Roland of Gilead, also known as the Last Gunslinger. He is a loner on a mission to track down the Man in Black and ultimately find the Dark Tower. On his travel through desolate world, we fo"
8575,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,1,"Now this is a book with a really neat premise, a promising world, and potential for a heart-wrenching character relationship and a mysteriously awesome villain... BUT IT FELL SO SHORT. What a letdown. To start, let me just say that when your Creative Writing 101 teacher tells you to avoid flashbacks as much as possible because it slows down the forward motion of the story, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY LISTEN. Not that I always hate flashbacks, but this book is a shining example of how NOT to use them. I'm"
8577,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,"Well, that was an odd read. One good thing about this first book in the epic Dark Tower series is that its mercifully short. I must agree with King in the foreword to this edition when he wrote - ""When I looked back at the first volume, which you now hold in your hands, three obvious truths presented themselves. The first was that The Gunslinger had been written by a very young man, and had all the problems of a very young man’s book. The second was that it contained a great many errors and fals"

8579,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,"To say this book was a watershed for me is an understatement. It literally changed the way I read, how I read, and I probably wouldn't write at all if not for reading it. The Gunslinger is the first in the Dark Tower series, which not only consists of the seven books in the series but also has ties to a great many of SK's other books. It's not horror, nor is it science fiction. It's dark dantasy at its very best, and it will by turns make you laugh, cry, scream in frustration, and probably throw"
8580,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,"At my former job, I sat at the lunch table in the cafeteria with a bunch of colleagues. I was just starting to love fiction and had just finished Tolkien’s legendary trilogy. I asked a fellow reader, “What do you think about the Dark Tower Series.” He looked at me for a minute, then finally told me what he thought. It was KA, man! Of all the people I could have asked, I asked one of the biggest fans of the series. He said he reads it over and over and over again, at least once a year. He told me"
8581,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,"I am not a fan of Stephen King's writing (though I am a fan of the man), so I have purposefully stayed away from The Dark Tower series. King's books always seem to follow a simple pattern with me. The first third of the book I find myself excited, joyfully surfing the book on the wave of King's pure inventiveness (no matter how I feel about his books in the end, it is hard to deny that his crazy mind is full of interesting ideas). In the second third of the book, the wave invariably begins to los"
8582,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,"In three words: baffling, weird, intriguing. ""It was strange how some of childhood's words and ways fell at the wayside and were left behind, while others clamped tight and rode for life, growing the heavier to carry as time passed."" I honestly don't think I've ever been so confused by a book and yet still wanted to keep reading it. I've read books before where because it was so confusing I just had no desire to battle through to figure out what was going on. With The Gunslinger though, King some"
8583,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,"I am trying to open myself up to new things. For a long time I didn’t read science fiction or fantasy, as I didn’t see them as “my kind of thing”. (Whatever that means, anyone who peers at my reading history over the last four years or so, will note that I have a clear love of genre fiction). But I have decided recently to broaden my horizons. So I read Peter Hamilton’s Void trilogy last year (held the attention, but had a rushed ending) and now I’m tacking that big part of Stephen King I’ve alw"
8584,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,"This whole book was so weird. I can't even. How do you even review something like this? The scene was set so well I could imagine it perfectly, everything about this book was so strange, so dark and unfriendly. Reading this was kind of an enigma haha, yes, it was very cryptic but it was in a way that was engaging and not in a way that frustrated or annoyed me. I was always interested, even if it was extremely vague, and even if by the last page I was literally mouthing ‘what the fuck’ I loved eve"
8585,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,1,"A brilliantly written, incredible pile of trash. Let me expound. What exactly is this book about? The author doesn't know, read the Afterword if you don't believe me. What are the motivations of the characters? The author doesn't know, read the Afterword. In fact for every single damn question the author seems to have no clue as to the final outcome. Supposedly this is entire storyline is meant to be 3000 pages long and the 286 pages I just read took 12 years some crap along those lines. So it shoul"
