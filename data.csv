0,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"I’m going to do something that's a little disrespectful and start this review by talking about another fantasy series that I’ve enjoyed: A Song of Ice and Fire. That series rules. It has everything I’ve wanted in a series since Tolkien but there’s one thing to be said about it, neither good or bad, that is a big part of its impact: it is dark, very very dark. The darkness comes, as it should in all quality fiction, not necessarily from the actual bad things that happen to good people, but from t"
1,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"Anton Chekhov famously said that if an author mentions a gun, it had better go off at some point, a point often attributed to Raymond Chandler (who at least practiced this rule). The same goes for fantasy writers. Fantasy doesn't need to be all blood and whirling blades, but if a fantasy writer straps a broadsword to a character's side, it had better be drawn in anger, at some point.<br><br>This was one of the best fantasy novels I've read in a while, especially impressive as it's a first novel. It has"
2,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"I was up until half five yesterday morning reading intensely to finish off this story. I didn't write the review then as it would have been a tired, mumbled mess with little to no eloquence and it wouldn't have included any cool sounding words. Let's see how I get on now after a good nights sleep. Prior to reading this, I had completed Abercrombie's Shattered Sea trilogy and enjoyed it a lot. Where that was classic story focused fantasy with twists aplenty, this is best described as a macabre, d"

5,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,1,"I almost put down the book when 3 paragraphs in the first 3 pages began with some version of this line:<br><br>""Shit,"" he said.<br><br>But I managed to slog through because I was told this was a some genre-breaking novel that didn't rely so heavily on typical fantasy clichés and it was supposed to be really dark and gritty.

7,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"Joe Abercrombie certainly knows how to write some disturbingly likable characters. In any other book the protagonists would be the bad guys. Logan Ninefingers is a brutal warrior who goes into insane blood rages where he kills anything, and everything, near him. Yet, weirdly, he is also a wise and sensitive soul. San Dan Glocka is a torturer whose heart is pure malice, yet somehow his attitude toward life boarders on the hilarious. These two are such great characters; they make the series what i"
8,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"The Blade Itself will undoubtedly become classic fantasy. I found it engrossing, and one of the best examples of the ""darker"" epic fantasies, with protagonists lacking in traditional heroic qualities and quests that are less than selfless. I liked the way the story was constructed, primarily following three main characters, with a fourth was added partway through the book. I was fairly certain they would intersect at some point, so part of the interest in the story is seeing how their individual"

12,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"I can certainly say that this book is gritty. So, you start reading it and it pushes your face in mud, sweat and blood.

13,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"It's been a while since I read a fantasy trilogy all the way through, back to back. Joe Abercrombie's The First Law series was too compelling not to finish in a single marathon. The first book, The Blade Itself, introduces a cast of well-developed, complex characters throw together in a world loosely based on medieval Europe. At first, it's not entirely clear what the major story line will be. It's also not clear who the good guys and bad guys are -- kind of like real life. If this sounds like A"

The writing style is blunt and efficient, with an identifiably British tone leavening the ‘grim darkness’: a strain of dark wit, and frequent uses of the interjection ‘Er—’, suggest that Terry Pratchett and PG Wodehou"

97,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,2,"<i>The Blade Itself</i> is the first in a trilogy, and it takes its time building up a vivid sense of the setting. It gives us plenty of time to get to know the characters in their current flawed states rather than jumping immediately into the changes they'll go through.

111,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,Stunning stuff! Cleverly written with a sense of humour running throughout the book. Many characters with nothing initially to do with anything to do with each other coming up with the same quotes in their head provides much of the humour in the novel e.g' You have to be practical about these things' and 'I hate stairs!' etc always produces a laugh. The characters are all very well rounded and no one is perfect in fact there are some scenes that are quite shocking considering what has gone on be
112,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"Dark and humourus! Loads of interesting characters, very real/ raw for that medieval ish period.

Ferro and Logen are my favourite =) Up to the next!<br><br>Hopefully some more of this: “The man screamed, and screamed behind his mask, and the Bloody-Nine laughed, and twisted the blade.

Overall, there was too much grimdark check-list going on. That said, at least Abercrombie has good prose, which is something that can't be said for much of fantasy these days. It also doesn't ramble on about unimportant content, which is a huge plus! I can tell this is working into being a great series, so definitely will continue. <br><br>What does the title mean, anyway?

However, there is a pitfall; I know nothing about what's going on. In the beginning, it didn't appear close enough to our world for me to be able to project previous experience onto it.

While George RR Martin has been slumping with the last two books of the Song of Ice and Fire series and playing footsie with HBO, Joe Abercrombie is writing fantasy the way it should be written. Unapologetic, edgy, filled with intrigue and amazing battle scenes. I can't express just how good these books were, you'll just have to read them for yourselves.

128,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"Loved it. Did this as an audiobook. This one started slow for me, but the narration of Steven Pacy would make phone contract boilerplate sound rich and interesting, so I kept going and I'm glad I did. Abercrombie has lots of room to do very deep character development, and he takes advantage of it.

129,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"Simply one of my favorite trilogies of all time. Joe Abercrombie has created a very dirty, real, and believable world. The story has several main characters that we get to know and to love. What makes this series so unique is its ability to blur the lines... The Good guys and Bad guys do right and wrong and make things very grey, and make it difficult for us to differntiate the two.

The Blade Itself felt like a whirlwind of a book, despite probably being the slower of the three as it builds things up.

Add some more tinder as the fire grows until the larger pieces of wood burn on their own and then you just have to keep it going.

The rhythm of this translation is smooth and rolling, but it can have a narcotic effect in which the sounds and melody (even in silence) lull you away from the language and the story. This isn't a bad thing, of course, especially if you're hanging out on Circe's island or eating a little lotus. Maybe this is why episodes and words resonate differently on repeated readings- I find the book"
749,The Odyssey,Homer,2,"This was one of the novels we had to read in my freshman year english class.<br>I did not rlly like this book, i didn’t know what was going on. i just knew enough to pass my tests and such over this book. I did love the greek gods involved in it, because i have always wanted to know more about them. <br>Overall, the amount of characters thrown in was overwhelming at times, but i mean i had to read it right? oh well"
750,The Odyssey,Homer,4,"Aloin lukea Odysseiaa hieman skeptisellä asenteella, mutta se voitti minut puolellensa puoliväliin mennessä. Kuten varmaan kaikilla, minullakin on käsitys siitä, mitä klassikossa tapahtuu, mutta sen lukeminen oli elämys tiedoista ja olettamuksista huolimatta. Jo se, että Odysseiaa on luettu läpi vuosituhansien, on todella kunnioitettava asia."

761,The Odyssey,Homer,3,"As with most books high schoolers at my learning institution are required to read, I heard horror stories about The Odyssey from older siblings, whiny facebook friends, etc. Needless to say, my expectations were low. I did have a little faith in it though; it's a ""classic"" for a reason. If I could sum it up in a word: meh. The characters were uninteresting, especially Odysseus himself. I feel bad for the ancient Greeks who had to regard him as a hero, considering he is a major jerk. Being a fair"

763,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"This is an incredible read - provided you are interested in a plot-driven story. I usually am not - what is happening around the next corner of a story is generally less interesting to me than what the character will do with it. How that event will change them. But that isn't a factor here. Instead, in this story, you see the height of plot-driven story-telling. And it is fascinating - both for what it reveals about ancient Greece, and for how it structures itself. Truly, so many tropes in moder"
764,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"It has been many years since I read The Odyssey, and, while I appreciated it, I don’t remember actually enjoying it. Wilson’s translation changed that.

I am now thinking that this text is probably above being rated since whether or not one ""likes"" Homer is beside the point.

782,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"Rereading The Odyssey, this time in Emily Wilson's recent and much-discussed translation, brought to mind how much this classic speaks to issues of our own day. To give a single example, a major theme of the text, and I had largely forgotten this, is the importance of hospitality towards strangers, a theme that is also all over the Hebrew Bible. When Antinous rebukes the Swineherd for bringing the beggar, actually Odysseus in disguise, to the suitors feast, his words sound familiar: ""Do we not h"
783,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"I have a soft spot for the history of how we learned things and because of that, Wilson's Introduction and Translator's notes are the highlight of this book for me. I have no real background in Classics and at most a high school level of knowledge about mythology and the Ancient World, and I found her thorough explanation of what we do and don't know about who Homer was, when The Odyssey is from, and the cultural and historical context of the poem to be enlightening, fascinating, and very access"
784,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"Emily Wilson’s translation of the classic tale of Odysseus’ voyage and return home is very readable, and her notes on the text provide some context without overwhelming the reader.

785,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"Joe Sachs' translation is clean, clear, and accurate. It lacks the poetry of many other translations, but there are plenty of those and not enough of these. The only one it compares to is Lattimore, but Sachs treads more lightly, more like Odysseus himself, and less like Achilles. Sachs wisely appends his ""introduction"" to the end of the work, a gesture of good sense and humility. Like Peter Green, Sachs spent a whole career reading and questioning and talking about the classical Greeks before s"
786,The Odyssey,Homer,4,"This story brings new meaning to the expression about fish and house guests!<br><br>I much preferred this to The Iliad.

816,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"Everything about this new translation is a class act. It brought the times and ways of Odysseus' return to Ithaca to life. The poetic translation was fun to read, but it supported a gorgeous revisiting of the book that endowed it with a freshness that surprised and delighted me. I read it slowly, making my own notes and commentary as I went a long, letting me capture the things that seemed so familiar as to seem contemporary, or things so alien that I could not see any relationship to my own cul"
817,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"Fagels's translation of the Iliad and the Odyssey are both magnificent -- highly readable, with forceful and direct prose that (I have to imagine, since I have no expertise) are closer to the experience of the original oral texts.

This one does -- though, unexpectedly (for me, anyway), it's most compelling moments actually belong to Pen"
818,The Odyssey,Homer,3,"I was not sure whether I was going to enjoy The Odyssey, but I actually did. The translation was (mostly) entertaining and fun to read. It is clear why the tale of Odysseus' journey home is so popular. I would like to go back to this someday and reread it because my class that I was reading it for made us skip a few chapters in the middle and i don't feel like going back and reading the chapters I missed right now. My only complaint is that at some parts it was slow and I became bored because it"
819,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"I've decided to treat this book as a treatise on manners. I'm puzzled about one thing though. The next time I throw a party and have an uninvited guest, is it more appropriate to impale him on one of my bronze spears? or to cut off his genitals, feed them to my dog, and then cut off his nose, hands and feet? At least, I can now rest assured that slaughtering my unfaithful women servants is a task best left to my henchmen."
820,The Odyssey,Homer,3,"UPDATE: I have rated it lower; last time was 4 stars and this time is 3. I was going to go as low as two, but the chapters about Polyphemus and the destruction of the suitors at least keep me interested...<br>_____________________________________________________________<br>If this wasn't a literary classic, I would probably rate it lower, but I understand its importance in canonical and historical realms and respect it as such."
821,The Odyssey,Homer,3,"The spicy tale of Odysseus' protracted and wandering return to Ithaca and his wife Penelope after the events of the Iliad. I was surprised to find the epic so accessible. Some of the violent scenes are very unpleasant and superfluous, but some passages and ideas are luminous and it is easy to see why Homer was so beloved and the work has survived.<br><br>When I visited Ithaca it was nice to know the story!<br><br>"
822,The Odyssey,Homer,4,"A wonderful adventure, so much better than the Iliad. One of those classic stories that you have heard of bits and pieces from here and there; probably from the odd movie, this is the book a lot of it has been taken from. Sirens and Cyclops and vengeful Gods, King's and queens and backstabbing traitors. For a book that was written so long ago this quite the action packed adventure. Well written with the odd twist here and there. I'll be re-reading this one day."
823,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"J'ai préféré <i>L'Odyssée</i> à <i>L'Iliade</i>. Le récit est plus dynamique, il y a plus de péripéties et le personnage voyage, là où le siège de Troie fixait et figeait fatalement un peu l'action. Le style est moins pompeux également, vu que l'on croise moins de hauts personnages aux titulatures à rallonge !<br>Une excellente lecture, dans une collection (pour enfants, certes) bien sympa."
824,The Odyssey,Homer,5,"One of the most important books ever written... the very fabric of storytelling is woven with the wily hands of the ever crafty Odysseus. Meet the hero who inspired all the rest and discover that he is not so much of a hero as a man who wants to get home. Above all, he is human - painfully, gloriously, tragically, definitely so."
825,The Odyssey,Homer,4,SPOILERS<br><br>- It could have been 5 stars but since Odysseus cheated on Penelope with Circe I can't do that. Why Odysseus? Why?<br><br>- Another thing I didn't like was that Deus ex machina ending.<br><br>- My favorite character: grey-eyed Athene &lt;3

1189,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,"The first time I read Mockingjay, I thought it was rushed and didn't think it stood up to the first two books in the Hunger Games series. However, once I re-read it I found that the rushed feeling didn't come from a hurried and cramped writing style (as many fans suggest - they think Collins rushed to meet a deadline), but from the sense of urgency that Suzanne Collins masterfully injected into the battle scenes.

When I finished reading it this morning, I was shivering and crying. <br>This is not a love story.

Maybe this book is labeled as dystopian but everything in it is real. We live it now - just watch the news."
1193,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,1,I was bored. The characters I'd once loved for their colour and fire fell flat.

1287,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"This book was my first fantasy read since Harry Potter. It painted an amazing picture that had elements of magic, but not so much that it made the plotline unbelievable. Talya's transformation from quiet shy adolescent child too confident young woman was Not only believable but extraordinary. Magic came in the form of magical horses which was very appealing to me as I was horse crazy since I was a young kid. This book left you in a state of wonder as to what may happen next. I can't wait to see"
1288,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"Typical sort of ""young adolescent who has a tough life and cruel family discovers they have a special gift and is whisked away to become some sort of special mage/wizard/healer/warrior"" book, but certainly enjoyable, and I like having a young girl be the protagonist. It was compelling enough that I continued to the sequels and I would revisit the universe when I have time.<br><br>Edit: First read in 2011, re-read April 2015 and enjoyed it just as much despite having well worn tropes. They get reused bec"
1289,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"So this is where it all started with Talia. While not my favourite off shoot from the Heralds of Valdemar, I still enjoyed learning about Talia. This book includes the usual intrigue and overcoming obstacles."
1290,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"I really enjoyed this book. The reason I gave it only 3 stars is that sometimes the writing and the story are a little too simple and you can tell the writer is inexperienced. That and the huge cliche of the small, miserable child, who gets chosen for a grand destiny."
1291,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"4 stars<br><br>Where has this book been all my life? Seriously. I have a paperback copy somewhere in the basement that I never read, which was purchased long, long ago. Since I read almost exclusively in digital now, there was little chance that I would go digging through boxes of books for the paper copy. But then! the library! added a digital! copy to their collection!!! I checked it out on a whim, and had a very fun journey with Talia and Rolan.<br><br>This book reminded me of Harry Potter in both tone and t"
1292,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"Reading an old favorite book again after some years is always a risky proposition. I admit that I was a bit apprehensive when I started listening to the audiobook. Would I hate it now? Would I find Talia too much of a Mary Sue to be endured? I loved this book and this series so much and it added a great deal to my personal and spiritual growth in my younger days. <br>Looking at it now, I have to admit that Talia is just a bit too perfect in this first book. Lackey learned a lot from this series and"
1293,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"Not a bad story, but nothing outstanding. I was enamored with it (as with most Valdemar stories) when I first read it, years ago, as one of my first fantasy stories. Now, decades later, with hundreds of other fantasy stories behind me, not so much.<br>I like the heroine, Talia. I sympathize with her self-doubts and her reticence, and her desperate attempts to fit in. The first part of the book was actually pretty good. Unfortunately, when the second part rolled in, the protagonist suddenly changed,"
1294,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"Revisiting this story like an old friend, I was pleased to be reminded how much of the series is foreshadowed here. Not only is Vanyel's story the historic tale that inspires Talia in her dreams of Heraldry, but Albrecht's life and the Tedrel Wars are both very present as immediate influences on the events of this first novel. The arc of not only Talia's story but Elspeth's is hinted at here, and I wonder how much Lackey knew even in this first book about the world of Valdemar. <br><br>In a way, this is"
1295,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"An utterly delightful YA novel about what I've come to think of as the standard trope: a sad young girl discovers that she has a magical pet that loves her best, and her whole life changes. <br><br>And yet: all tropes have origins. And just as no one could accuse Tolkien of being derivative, just so can no one accuse Lackey, because I'm fairly sure she is one of the inventors of this particular sub-genre.<br><br>The fact that the story normalizes gay relationships too is a nice bonus. I kept being surprised it"
1296,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"I did find the story rather too contrived and frankly a bit maudlin in places. There was little action and apart from the main protagonist the characters would have benefited from more depth. Although it wasn't awful, I think I'm probably a little too old now for this particular series, so I probably won't bother with the rest."
1297,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,I tend to love Mercedes Lackey so I wasn't surprised to like this one. One of the complaints I generally have for her though is that she tends to go over such vast time spans so quickly and that characters tend to develop bonds so quickly that you don't really get to see the how/why. Still I thought that this was a good read and I'm excited to move forward with the series.
1298,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"I was looking for a fantasy book that didn't involve war for a change, and here was the perfect one. I felt the pace was a bit fast and there was some episodes within the book that were glossed over so I found it a little hard to really get to know the characters. Other than that though, I enjoyed it, and 12-year-old-me is gutted I didn't read it back then!"
1299,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"This is a real classic fantasy series, one of the earliest I remember reading, and it really holds up. Sensational in its gay rep for the time period too. This was the first Valdemar book I read and I will always have emotional attachment to it even if I think the Magic's Pawn/Price/Promise ones are actually better."
1300,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"Probably my biggest complaint of this book is the way time passes. Months go by with a few words. This just over 300 page book occurs over the span of 3.5 years. The characters mature well throughout this time, but reading it and suddenly thinking, “wait, how much time has passed?” wasn’t the most enjoyable. <br>Also can’t believe the Bury Your Gays trope existed in 1987 smh"
1301,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,That was fun! I was a little surprised that the Companion didn’t have much of a role? But I’m excited to read the rest of these!
1302,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"<b>Genre: Epic Fantasy</b><br><br>Terry Brooks, Robert Jordan, David Eddings, and other popular male authors where about it for Epic Fantasy exposure when I was first starting out in the genre. So it came as a shock when the allure of a female voice was so addicting after being bombarded with male writing—in fact Lackey was the first female EF author I had ever read back when.&nbsp; It was a shock to read a book that actually had emotions and plots that worked with them.&nbsp; Of course the idea of mystical horses that"
1303,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"So after a week spent reading Patrick Rothfuss, I felt a longing for the fantasy I choose for myself as a teenager. It wasn't this book, but Owlflight and Brightly Burning that drew me in and refused to let go, but like many series in outdated country libraries, they didn't have all the books. Maybe they did at some point, but over the years theft and use had dwindled the collection down to a few titles. It is with great shame that in my adulthood I haven't hunted more of these down, now I have"
1304,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,2,"I was really torn between two and three stars. I remember loving this book in high school and really connecting with Talia. I remember feeling very intrigued by empathy being a ""gift"". Even after figuring out that I wasn't as into Mercedes Lackey anymore, this book still held a special place in my heart.<br><br>So you can imagine that I was incredibly disappointed with this read through. I remember having certain thoughts when I was younger. Why didn't <i>I</i> know that Cheryl was into Keren until I suddenly"
1305,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"Magic horses, guys.<br><br>I really love the Valdemar books. They are a little bit fluffy and wish fullfillment-y, but they are a lot of fun and oddly progressive in a lot of ways. Valdemar is kind of the perfect fantasy kingdom in a lot of ways, with a monarchy, but a monarchy run by people who are guaranteed to be good people, at least, even if it doesn't always promise that they will be good rulers. <br><br>Talia is an easy heroine to like.

It's chock full of telling-not-showing and extraneous adverbs. It lacks narrative structure.

1311,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,1,This book was on my receipt with recommendations I got after purchasing the latest in britain's green rider series. For me to write a review on how bad a book was...that has never happened- until now. <br> I think Abigail (below reviews) hit the nail on the head. It was a poorly written book with almost no plot. I kept waiting for there to be a point to the story. I feel like maybe this book strayed to far from original idea. I was under the impression it was all about taming the queen's bratty chil

1314,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"Oh, dear. Arrows of the Queen is <i>such</i> an adolescent novel. Not a Young Adult novel - I'm not talking about category, here.

1318,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"A coming of age story that reads for the most part as if it's written for pre-teens. Not like a lot of Mercedes Lackey's fantasy novels which tend to be very overwritten and with lots of angst between the lovelorn and generally doomed characters.

Thankfully, Mercedes Lackey's first book is not actually <i>bad</i>. <i>Arrows of the Queen</i> is readable, if often slow and almost completely lacking in plot (the ending surprised me because, well, there wasn't one).

1324,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"Pretty darn good. It seems there are a number of fantasy series out there that start with a young girl growing up in an abused/repressed situation, she dreams of something bigger, some talent/ability is discovered in her, she gets the appropriate training, and her dreams come true to some extent. The thing I appreciate about this one is that the young girl does not unrealistically blossom as soon as she leaves home. She has scars from her past that take time to overcome.

If I had read it as a teenager, I'm sure I would have loved it. The story itself is pretty good. I like the world and the characters. But the way Talia's trials were written bothered me.

My taste for Mercedes Lackey is a funny thing; it was born out of elements from her earlier books... the tormented young protagonists, the horses, the general goodness of her people (except for the ones who are bad - who are then thoroughly bad). But it is not due to her fantastic writing ability - because while Lackey can put together a plot and clearly is prolific, there is nothing noteworthy about her style. I do not admire her turns of phrase. I just wrap their"
1335,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"One of my favourite books of all time and just as good today as it was when I first read it more than twenty years ago. This book takes what could be cliched fantasy elements and weaves them into a perfectly paced plot and characters you desperately care about. The balance between feel-good adventure and grim, occasionally tragic realism is masterful. Anyone who's read the following books will also appreciate the many moments of foreshadowing."
1336,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"Imagine Harry Potter for a slightly older crowd: young adolescents receiving magical training as part of their overall training as Heralds.

And it gave me hope that someday I will be an awesome editor."
1339,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"It's not deathless prose, but it doesn't have to be. I remember what it was like to be a depressed, frustrated, unpopular, book-crazy, horse-crazy teenager, and how this book connected with all those emotions when I settled back to read it one stormy summer afternoon.

1343,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"Initial thoughts review: this book reminded me SO much of Tamora Pierce's stories! I grew up reading them over and over again, so my rating may have more to do with nostalgia than anything else. I can't wait to pass this title along to other Pierce fans."

1350,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,This book is like going home again.
1351,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"Meh. Too simple a world, depthless characters, and many moments where I rolled my eyes. Will not be continuing the series. Would not recommend you read this unless you're like...10."
1352,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"I samma anda som Tamora Pierce, fast med lite svårare språk. En bok från en serie av många från samma värld, lättläst kvällsnöje."
1353,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,A very great book. Lovely plot as with all her books. With a charcter who through all her fears and past grievances can still look to the future with light in her eyes.
1354,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"I'm impressed that after 20 years, this book still holds up. It's a great world, interesting characters, and I still want to be a Herald when I grow up."

1358,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,This is a little gem of a book. Brilliantly written and so easy to get into.
1359,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"I found this book quaint at first. It's a story about a girl who doesn't want to do girl things and wants to go on adventures like the ones she reads in books. She's chosen by fate (in this case, Roland, a horse deity) to go to a magical school that's much more like home than her actual home was and finds out that she was chosen to help the Queen bring harmony to the kingdom. She learns how to be a Herald and helps uncover a plot to overthrow the Queen. So far, so trite, right?<br><br>But Arrows of the"

This was a cute and fun fantasy novel and I enjoyed it quite a bit.<br><br>Talia has just been Chosen to become a Herald - part of the Queen's personal guard. Adjusting to her new life at the Collegium can be tough, but it's full of new friends, new knowledge, and a whole new life. <br><br>In a lot of ways, this was a pretty typical fantasy novel - a poor, downtrodden kid who doesn't feel like they belong is whisked away to be part of a magic school for special people with special ab"

1362,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,2,"Our YAck book for June, chosen by Laura who wanted to give us something nostalgic and lovely. Unfortunately ARROWS OF THE QUEEN was neither for me. I’ve only been introduced to Lackey’s writing within the last 10 years and so far it’s been 0 for 3 with her books. I’ve read THE FAIRY GODMOTHER and HUNTER, both from newer series, and I DNFed the former and didn’t like the latter. This one wasn’t really much different.

1363,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,1,"I started to read this because the trilogy was cheap on Kindle and I haven't tried this author before, though I know she's very prolific.

Set within the Collegium, just like Talia, you are there to learn.<br><br>This is not a bad thing; her classes and instructors are all quite enjoyable. The worldbuilding is fine, wherein we are taught magic, battles, intrigue, and monsters exist, but experience little of it firsthand.

1368,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"2.5<br><br>Finished it but skimmed parts. There are no really developed characters. This book reminds me of a worse-executed The Blue Sword / McKinley books in general, in that it creates a lovely, warm setting but has no urgency and hence agency (for the protagonist.)

1369,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"<i>Arrows of the Queen</i> is a typical YA high fantasy adventure novel that uses tropes like training schools, communication/bonding with animals, and some measure of courtly intrigue in the vein of <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/147843.Green_Rider__Green_Rider___1_"" title=""Green Rider (Green Rider, #1) by Kristen Britain"" rel=""nofollow"">Green Rider</a> and Pierce's Tortall series.

1370,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,2,"I really want to like this book. I really do. The world it creates is breathtaking. The concept of Heralds/Companions is immediately enticing, and the entire culture of the book makes you feel warm and happy inside. <br>However, I could not get over the sloppy writing style. It felt like one long exposition. The time and perspective jumps are jumbled and confusing, the characters are very one-dimensional, and the conflicts are too hastily resolved.

1371,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,1,"I read this book along time ago and was so thoroughly unimpressed that it stuck with me for over a decade. The plot was anemic, the characters unmemorable and flat, the stakes low, and the conflict flat.<br><br>*Spoilers*<br><br>There is almost nothing that I remember about the plot or story, except for the part where Lackey sets up a romance, has the characters utterly fail three or four times to have sex, then has them sorta shrug it off and decide then and there that are just friends.

1374,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"So I'm being slightly generous in my rating here -- it definitely had a few debut novel problems in that information was sometimes oddly given in omniscient breaks from the main narrative (something that persists even in later Lackey novels though she does it much more smoothly so you hardly notice), there were jarring jumps in time that made the book feel episodic with the reader skipping half a season, and the plot and worldbuilding were pretty spasmodic. This has the definite feel of a ""YA no"
1375,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"Reread for nostalgia I guess. Surprised at well it holds up. I'm mean it's basically teenage wish fulfillment (abused girl turns out to be special and gets special magical horse too!), and it's kind of more episodic than an actual plot, but it is essentially a bildungsroman and mostly just a lot of world building, but it's a head a shoulders above the usual YA fantasy of girls discovering they are special. It's not without problems. Most the conflict is quickly and easily resolved, there's huge"
1376,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"Wow, did I ever enjoy this. I have read books of Mercedes Lackey before but it was years ago and I decided it was about time I started from the beginning.

1378,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"That was cute. Sweet easy read, in the style I love with the themes that grab me. Maybe a bit too glib and easy for our heroine, all hardships felt like they were dispersed easily and in terms of emotional depth while written well I didn't connect as much because the characters still seemed to lack the necessary amount of..well..character. Also most likely because I would have LOVED this properly were I the target age, as it has the same feel as Tamora Pierces early books.. But I think what made"

1382,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"4.5 Stars - This older fantasy was on my to-read list until I came across the trilogy in a used bookstore during my Victoria vacation. It was interesting enough that I flew through the book captivated. Talia is a different type of character than I am used to reading about, especially with the Holderkin aka 'communal/colony' type of upbringing with abuse that bothered me a bit.

1384,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"What girl hasn't wanted to be rescued from some more-or-less desperate state and carried away on the back of a white horse? For many of us, it's the knight on the white horse who's the hero. For Talia, the heroine of this book, it's the horse alone. Mercedes Lackey dispenses with the knight, as why shouldn't she? We don't all need, or even want, the knight-hero, we just need the vehicle. And a horse, of whatever color, is close to the heart and dreams of many a girl (no matter what her age, even"

Just think: If I liked it, I'd suddenly have access to twenty or more books in an awesome universe. Unfortunately, I couldn't even get through the book.<br>When I pick up a book, I want to read a story. This wasn't a story. It was a whole introductory book, and as such, it was boring.

1386,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"This is a classic 1980's fantasy trilogy featuring kingdom guardians called Heralds and their magical horses. Thirteen year old Talia escapes her family's ultra-patriarchal society and their plans for her marriage by becoming chosen by one of the magical horses called Companions to start training to become a Herald. Most of the book is Talia at the Herald school as she deals with bullies, finding friends, and growing up. There is not a ton of action or fighting here. The focus is more on the gro"
1387,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"So, I've never read any of Mercedes Lackey's fiction in my adolescence. This is a pity, probably, because this book is exactly tailored to the adolescent fantasy reader. I'm going to be rather critical in this review so I want to preface this by making it clear that despite its many flaws, Arrows of the Queen was quite readable and I was interested in what would come next despite its lack of much character development or a terribly involved plot. This is something of a feat, and I credit it as m"
1388,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"Mercedes Lackey's first novel and my first experience with her work (unless I've read a short story by her in the past and forgot about it), and it's a rather rough effort. Lackey created an extremely appealing setting and some likable characters, but there's very little plot here; <i>Arrows of the Queen</i> is more of an introduction for the setting and showing us Talia's journey to becoming a Harald than anything else. Every obstacle is temporary at worst; even conspiracies against the throne, and we"
1389,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"3,5 stars. One of the fundamental works of Romantic Fantasy, this book is an amazingly easy read. Talia is a joyous character, and the character and relationship build is fantastic. This is what this type of fantasy is about: characters creating bonds, discovering themselves. For a book written in 1987, it was very progressive, and I don't doubt it is a heavy influence of modern YA. However, the pacing is strange, there are a lot of Deus Ex Machina situations, some of the important plot scenes a"

Talia, the lead, seems like a character I can relate with and I look forward to see her adventure continue.<br><br>Also side note: This feels like something Tamora Pierce might have used as an inspiration for Alanna's world if that makes any sense...

1392,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"Maybe I've been reading too much GRRM but I found this book to be oddly lacking in world and character building.

1393,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,Talia is a child in a Holderkin family and is considered to be a trouble maker. When she turns 13 her father's wives tell her it is time for her to be married. Talia doesn't want to be married so she runs off to her favourite hiding place.

Then she realized it is a Companion but he has no Herald so Talia decides to return him to his Herald and thus starts a journey that ult
1394,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,2,"Although this book is around 300 pages, it goes by quickly as the plot moves along smoothly. There’s not too much excitement or action, but it ties in nicely to previous and future novels. The two most prominent issues have to do with the writing. Character perspectives are not clear as they switch often and without a break in the text. Also, near the end there are many grammatical issues. Overall, it is a casual read if you are interested in some background of Valdemar, but might not make you w"
1395,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"I would categorize this as YA Fantasy. Young Talia leaves her home where she is underappreciated and about to embark on a life of servitude. She meets Rolan- a magical horse - with whom she forms an immediate connection. Rolan takes her to the Collegium where she will learn how to become a Herald- a protector of the Queen. In addition, she is to take charge of Elspeth, the Queen's spoiled daughter. Talia discovers she has innate gifts as she makes friends and some enemies. I enjoyed the book for"
1396,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"Really, really good book. I read almost 60% one day and finished it in the next couple. Lackey's writing is very easy to read, and her concepts are worded in a way that makes them clear to understand. I was a little bummed about Talia and Skif for awhile, but the end made up for that. Really, the only ""complaint"" I have is that it is sometimes hard to follow the flow of time. Lackey mentions the leaves changing and the seasons, but it still becomes muddled in terms of weeks/months/years. I will"
1397,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"The pairing of teens and Companions (magical horses) would make this a strong read-alike for the <i>Dragonriders of Pern</i> series by Anne McCaffrey. The strong feminist tones recall Marion Zimmer Bradley, to whom this book is dedicated. (The tones also harken to Anne McCaffrey.) Additionally, the young, unwanted child going to a school for magic to find themselves and destiny ties into the <i>Harry Potter</i> series by J. K. Rowling, but with a strong female twist."
1398,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"<br>This is one of my favorite books from when I was younger. So rereading it at as an adult makes it even more special, there are so many nuances that I didn't see when I was younger. <br><br>This book, has magic, fantasy and an incredible world that is richly developed. The main character in this book, is a young girl named Talia. It follows her story as she finds herself swept up into mystery, myth and new family.<br>"
1399,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"<strong>The beginning of a wonderful tale. </strong><br><br>Arrows of the Queen marks the start (but not chronologically) of Lackey's tales of Valdemar. And what a great start it is. Fantasy world building shown through the eyes of a character that believes the world itself is a fairy tale. Queen is charming while placing plot points and hints enough to sustain another 20 books. Valdemar is one of my favorite series, and Arrows my favorite trilogy within it."
1400,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"Reminded me somewhat of Tamora Pierce books, but with less conflict. I would say the one big drawback to the book was lack of conflict- there were things that happened and a sinister plot against the kingdom, but we were removed from it in perspective. The novel is obviously meant for a younger reader than myself (it has magic horses who are important characters, and the leads great struggle is accepting her own self worth), but it made a pleasant read while doing my laundry."
1401,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"Little did I know this was exactly the book I needed to read. It is the story of a 13-year old girl suddenly whisked away from everything she's known and put into the world she wanted to be in. It could be considered a princess-tale with more realism...if you want to see it that way.<br>Lackey is an author I have enjoyed. As the first published work of hers, I must say I thoroughly enjoyed it. Having read the first novel of some more modern popular writers, I have to say, it's too bad that they were"
1402,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"Excellent book for all ages, but especially good for pre-teens &amp; teens dealing with feeling isolated, the lead character in this book will be very relatable. I have always enjoyed Mercedes Lackey's writing, especially the Heralds of Valdemar series, and the nice thing is the Talia trilogy you do not need to actually read the previous books in the main part of the series to be able to follow Talia's story. Though I definitely recommend ALL of the books in the full series, if you can!"
1403,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"Having finished the Adept series, have decided to re-read from my owned books Mercedes Lackey's Valdemar series (which should take a good bit a time). Liked this story quite a bit, pretty much that of the classic misfit who does not fit in her place and is whisked away to where she not only fits in but is very much needed. Thought it was a little short on action, with a lot of the story working on setting up Lackey's world. But it was a quick absorbing read nonetheless."
1404,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"I love all the Mercedes Lackey books. I got the audiobook version via Hoopla, listened to most of it last night, and the rest today. Given a choice of fictional places to actually live in, Valdemar would top my list. I like the amount of detail given to the infrastructure, and the characters live on in my imagination. In some ways these stories remind me of Pern and of Darkover, which is not in the least surprising."
1405,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"I don't know why I've waited so long to read Mercedes Lackey! (probably because I knew she had a bazillion books and that I would get suckered into reading them all...) This story took me back to my younger days of reading Tamora Pierce and other strong-lady-character fantasies, and genuinely enjoying fantasy. I've been getting bored of the genre lately, but I think my love is about to get rekindled as I devour the rest of this series!"
1406,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"Really solid book. Lots of tropes, but the main character is really well developed. I enjoyed the world building and the plot. The friendship with the mentor figure was well done and emotionally satisfying. The love interest plot point was strangely developed and probably the only thing I didn’t enjoy about the story."
1407,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"It was nice to read this book again. Returning to Valdemar is always fun, and I like it when the problems the heroes face are bullies and bandits rather than world-ending cataclysms. It's always nice to read about Talia and friends, and I especially likes reading about her friendship and not-relationship with Skif."
1408,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"This had everything I love in a book, great characters, action, change, magic, a great main character, and wonderful supporting characters. I read this book in one sitting, and now can’t wait to get the next book!! My favorite books are the Alanna the Lioness books by Tamora Pierce, and I found a lot of the same elements in this book."
1409,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,This was a book I read as a child. I was bullied and spent most of my time reading. Even though I am male it presented such an amazing perspective. The perspective it provided helped reduce the impact of my trauma. I now work to help people professionally. I continue to recommend this novel/series as a way of explaining how to protect yourself from powerful emotions.
1410,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,I read the three book series I liked up until the end. I wanted more and all the other books that are a compliment to this series don't give you an update on the people in this particular series. I think the writer made a mistake in not giving a bigger picture after the last book in the Heralds of Valdemar series.
1411,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"The first part of a trilogy (The Heralds of Valdemar) and my first Mercedes Lackey novel and I'm impressed. The story of a young girl being Chosen to be a Herald, how she develops and grows into the role, is engaging, fun and written in an uncomplicated style that makes reading it a pleasure., Well worth looking at if you enjoy fantasy novels."
1412,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"I loved this book so much! The characters, the world, the GiftS, the Companions, the feminism! It's a breath of fresh air and I can't believe it's taken me so long to read these! I've read the Black Griffon trilogy and some other of her books but never these. I especially love how she described the most mundane details of daily tasks and how loving and real her characters seem."
1413,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"Obviously the first of a trilogy, as the book spends a fair amount of time establishing setting and character, which is fine. Fairly light in tone, but with hints of darkness to come. Talia is a little Mary Sue-ish at times. Still, an enjoyable YA fantasy with an interesting setting and likable characters."
1414,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"This was really great and held up to my memory of the book. I read it when in was younger and wasn't sure it'd still be good. I love Talia as a character and think all the characters develop well. I wish there was a more nuanced character and plot development , but honestly, it's a good story and totally worth the read."
1415,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"A young girl from a sheltered and repressively religious background, who has her head in the clouds and a passionate desire to become a Herald of Valdemar 'finds' a lone Companion and takes a wild ride away from her family and all she knew to become a trainee. This story is wonderfully written and proves that family is not just blood, its the people who love you."
1416,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"I used to LOVE this series. I needed a quick, light read so I picked up this one again. I can understand why I liked it before, but it seems dated and underwritten. Part of me wants to read the next two to see if my old liking comes through and part of me wants to cut my losses and tackle the rest of my to-be-read shelf."
1417,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,"Expectations really are key to reading experience! This was one of my least favorite Valdemar trilogies when I was younger, so my hopes were low when I picked this up for a reread, but most of the stuff I remember hating apparently happens in the later books -- this one is really not that bad. A solid old-school ""young girl goes off to magic school"" fantasy novel."
1418,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"This was a great book, if you read the series you will understand the plot. But if you jump right into the end of a twenty plus book series there are many things you won't understand.<br><br>I personally read many of the books from Black Griffin to the Owls trilogy and loved all of them."
1419,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,This was ok. A story about making friends and finding out where you belong. The magic and mystery in the story is off screen. It is talked about and solved by others. I would have found this more interesting if this story was written in 3rd person omniscient.
1420,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,I can't believe I haven't read this one yet. This is a story about a girl being chosen by a magical creature and ending up at a special school. There are so many books like this. Song of the Lioness sprung to mind immediately. I really liked it and want the next one. Right now.<br><br>
1421,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"Really sweet and awesome fantasy, loved the characterization and developement n stuffs. <br>wow i actually finished a book.<br>most of the time i just return say 7 books to the library, 3 overdue, four unread, two read, one half finished."
1422,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,2,"The plot arc and the setting are more like British boarding school than fantasy. Also, everybody keeps using the word ""awfully"" a lot (but Mercedes Lackey is American, I checked - it's strange). It also doesn't help that Talia is the saccharine archetype of feminine virtue."
1423,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,2,"It was... fine. I feel like I would have liked this much more ~10 years ago, but at this point it was slightly too old-school for me. I got my fill of this type of story with various other YA herione novels when I was actually a teenager."
1424,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"A bit of magic and folklore...about a young girl who finds out she is chosen to be a prestigious herald and work for the queen of this fictional land. Liked it a lot, but the second half of the book seemed to skim too much."
1425,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"This was a very enjoyable read. Talia's a strong character, even though I wished she could have found faith in herself and others a bit sooner, but it'll be interesting to follow her story in the next two books."
1426,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"This was so much fun, and while I think it exhibits some of what are now considered ""tropes"" (like the chosen one protagonist) I think it pulls them off quite well and was still a great read! A series with so many books in it, though, why do I keep doing this to myself..."
1427,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"Re-Read .. Awesome book, awesome series, awesome world, from an awesome author..<br><br>Haven't read any of the Valdemar books in a long time now, so I figured it was time to start it all from scratch again.. :)<br>"
1428,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"I really enjoyed this book. I'm a little (very) disappointed that I didn't find this series as a teenager. There are times where I had to remind myself to suspend my disbelief, but it was still a very fun read. It reminds me a lot of the Lioness series by Tamora Pierce."
1429,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,"¡Lo amo! Lo leí hace algunos años, lo volvi a leer y lo disfrute como si fuera la primera vez. La historia es increible, la magia. Loa personajes realmente sientes que puedes encontrarlos en la vida real. Y la forma en la que esta escrito te hace sentir que tu estas dentro de el libro. ¡Favorito!"
1430,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,2,"A fantasy where an oppressed 13 year old girl escapes and is selected as a herald working with a magic horse. My wife says she read lots of books in this series, and I see how a young girl would love it. I made it to the time her Herald school has bullies bullying her."
1431,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,2,"Sad. Shouldn't have revisited this as an adult. Loose storytelling, massive plot holes. Loved it as a teen though."
1432,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,1,did not finish. I hated the writing style and the main character.

1444,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,A well written book. Enjoyed reading it.
1445,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,This was great. I most especially loved the growth of the main character. There are lots of great characters in this book.

1447,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,"I enjoyed it for the most part and had trouble putting it down. However, what happened with the queer couple annoyed me quite a bit and brought my rating down."

1555,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,"To be honest, I am not really sure what I think of this book. I enjoyed it, certainly. It was wildly creative, of course. It basically reverses science and magic, making magic the real thing and science the myth; I suspect that residents of Discworld would find the book significantly less amusing than we do simply because so much of the humor comes from references to science which is not there.

1582,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,5,"There are many, many reasons to love this book - here are just two: Death and the Luggage. The Luggage never failed to cheer me up.

1612,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,5,"<br><br>Este libro un ""must read"" donde te introducen en Mundodisco, en sus personajes y en su increíble mitología. La imaginación de Terry es desbordante y es un maestro de lo absurdo.

1613,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,"Well... This was a bit weird. So many different things happened in so little time and sometimes it was hard to follow. The characters start in one place and find themselves in a totally different place at the end that one may find really weird. Still though, I love Pratchett's world and writing style, it can make you stop time to time and realize a different way to see things and I love that, since they are like tiny illuminations. Also, may I say Rincewind reminded me a falling, Balrog fighting"

1616,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,"Terry Pratchett's The Color of Magic was thoroughly enjoyable! The book was a quick, thoughtful, and entertaining read. I also want to make it a point that I used the word entertaining and not funny. Ive seen a lot of reviews for this book use the word funny. Occasionally I did laugh and it seemed to be created for that purpose but this book is no joke.... Its Discworld... And it's a hell of a lot of fun!"
1617,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,"Having already read a few Discworld novels, I decided it was time to go back to the beginning.<br>I really enjoyed the introduction to the world and characters like Death and descriptions of The Watch which all play larger parts in later books.<br>The book is also incredibly funny ; it is at times a little confusing, but you're just best to go with the flow and know that eventually it will all come together :)"
1618,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,I've previously read the graphic novel version of this. One big difference between this and the graphic novel is that this is more humorous. One could make parallels between the Discworld novels and the Xanth series by Piers Anthony. The two series share a wacky sense of humor but I suspect that the humor remains stronger in Discworld.
1619,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,"This is not your average series of events, we meet Rincewind who becomes a guide to a tourist called Twoflower. After a strange conflagration, these two travel across the Discworld encountering many a weird adventure. It should be mentioned that this world is actually on the back of a turtle... <br><br>So what about mating, dragons, the edge of this 'disc', gods, walking luggage, and board games?"

I was skeptical about reading it, because I knew it employs the type of humor that I just don’t seem to properly appreciate, but I was also curious about it. I’m talking about that unrealistic kind of humor that makes you laugh at the author’s cleverness, yet at the same time pulls you out of the story because it’s too ridiculous to take seriously.

It's amazing how an author that is so important to fantasy got overlooked by myself but I'm finally starting his books now.

Schon lange wollte ich damit befassen und dank dem Sammelband ""Die Magie der Scheibenwelt"" erhielt ich eine wunderbare Einstiegsmöglichkeit. Diese erste Geschichte um den Zauberer Ricewind ist allerdings noch sehr zerfahren und verzettelt. Auf weniger als 300 Seiten führt Terry Pratchett den Leser nicht nur in seine Fantasiewelt ein, er serviert auch unzähligen Figuren und Merkwürdigkeiten auf dem Tablett. Dies hat zur Folge,"
1636,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,"To see how it all began has been interesting for me. Pratchett's later Discworld books have a firmly established style and even some of the earliest entries in the series that I've read (Mort or Equal Rites, for example) are very different.

I was rather expecting to be blown away, but despite the well-crafted universe (who doesn't love a giant turtle), I was not amazed. The story is interesting, but inconsistently paced, and the beginning buts are much better than the end bits -- the sapient pearwood luggage ex machina gets a little old after awhile.

1649,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,5,"I love Discworld. This is the start of my second read of the series. Quite an undertaking at this point. <br><br>This, the first book, is strangely episodic. That's not a bad thing, it's just very different from what will come later. Having read the later books, I can spot the things that have been tweaked. (Namely, the Patrician. Huge tweak there.) But this is a great start to what would turn out to be a great series. And I still like Rincewind, believe it or not!"

(Discworld, #8; City Watch #1) by Terry Pratchett"" rel=""nofollow"">Guards! Guards!</a> - since it was hard not to read Rincewind and Twoflower as less engaging versions of Vimes and Carrot.

1651,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,5,The second best book I have read this year. (Ready Player One is still the best). I had been planning on delving into Pratchett's Discworld for a while and his passing made it more fitting to do so now. Why did I wait so long?!? This book is somewhere between amazing and hilarious while keeping you guessing and rooting for the characters. Pratchett was a mad genius and will be sorely missed. Thank you Terry for the Discworld. I will most definitely be continuing the series.
1652,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,"Ah, so whoever it was that advised me to start with the Watch books, instead of going by publication chronology, was completely right. Probably the most entertaining thing about these books is watching Pratchett working really hard to tune his funny. And there are flickers of that perfect pitch he has later, but mostly it's just sort of random-incidents-strung-together, and there's only occasional bits of <i>there</i> there."
1653,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,1,"This book frustrated me to no end. Very near the beginning of it, I thought about throwing it across the room because I could not for the life of me follow a conversation on about page 6.

1655,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,5,"O humor e a imaginação de Terry Pratchett são simplesmente geniais! Não sei dizer quantas vezes gargalhei alto enquanto lia, e economizei ao máximo as últimas páginas. Fantástico! É hilário até o último instante. Não vejo a hora de ler as sequências :)"

1657,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,The first book in the Discworld series and clear evidence of the brilliance that is Terry Pratchett. I was fascinated by the adventures of the tourist whose luggage has legs and the reluctant wizard as they find themselves in one tight fix after another throughout the land.
1658,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,"This should be 3.5 stars. I really enjoyed it, but found it all kind of random and leading nowhere. That being said, it was very imaginative and entertaining. Hrun the Barbarian was one of my favorites, as was anything the Luggage did."

Tolkien,5,"Given that Tolkien did not just invent a world, new creatures and weapons, but invented an actual freaking language, he gets 5 stars from me (I'm sure he was anxiously awaiting my approval). I could do without the 80 pages on tobacco production, but Tolkien wasn't writing a story; he was writing a history of a place that had never existed. I resisted reading them for years as I thought they were a level of dork I was not ready for. Then I saw the first movie and had to know what happened. I'm so"

Tolkien,5,"Dec 2013: Rereading with my 2 oldest kids after seeing ""Desolation of Smaug"" (they wanted to read it, the 2nd hasn't read beyond ""Hobbit"" yet, and I wanted to check my memory since I didn't remember things the same way the directors of the movie seemed to ;) Also gave a challenge to them, as in, ""I'll read these with you if you'll read through DICKENS with me, ha ha ha ha""...diabolical but they both accepted...we'll see how it goes. How about it you two??)<br><br>Enjoyed ""The Hobbit"" tremendously again."
1680,J.R.R. Tolkien 4-Book Boxed Set: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"I was introduced to The Lord of the Rings as the sequel to The Hobbit. I knew going into reading there wasn't going to be a lot of Bilbo, but that didn't stop me from reading ahead occasionally to see when his name would pop up next. <br><br>Reading The Lord of the Rings was a really different experience from The Hobbit not only because it's got a more epic scope and deals with more POV characters, but also because I felt like it introduced me to ""Mr Tolkien"". Tolkien in The Hobbit is writing for an a p"
1681,J.R.R. Tolkien 4-Book Boxed Set: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"This is not the first edition of this book that I had read. I had LOTR &amp; The Hobbit long-back, in different editions, at different stages of mind. Before the movies had been released, LOTR/H used to be our own secret garden where we could have escaped any time we liked, but now oue own images have been replaced or landscaped by Peter Jackson. Nevertheless, if you think that G.R.R. martin is the last word in terms of writing fantastically entertaining fantasy, then read this book, and change"

And Elladan and Elrohir! And all the elves.. sigh! <br>Oh, wasnt there Aragorn, Gandalf and some hobbits too? And werent they pursued by evil orcs while wandering through the forest? I think a ring was also playing a main part…<br>I fell instantly in love with these books when I read them for the first time ( I think I was about fifteen that time) and Im still fond of them. Yes, some people and books are destined to"

1689,J.R.R. Tolkien 4-Book Boxed Set: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,This series was fantastic. The artwork by Alan Lee was beautiful too. That Tolkien imagined this wonderful world so long ago is amazing! He was ahead of his time in creativity &amp; imagination. Seems to me he paved the way for other writers to embrace &amp; run with their imaginations &amp; creativity &amp; even bogus ideas. My beloved Harry Potter series for example is a definite distant relative to Lord of the Rings. They always compare Harry Potter to the Twilight saga but they aren't simila
1690,J.R.R. Tolkien 4-Book Boxed Set: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"this is a great book. If you like the lord of the rings movies and books you should read this. its the prequel to the story. Its all about how he got the ring and how it all started. tons of fighting and action but also at times calm. As you can tell from the title its about the hobbits but it also has the elves, dwarfs, and many other creatures. There is also a dragon and you get to meet gollum, the weird little creature that alway says ""my precious"", who at a time was also a hobbit untill he w"
1691,J.R.R. Tolkien 4-Book Boxed Set: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,"Do not trust the movie adaptations to show you how wonderful Tolkien is! I cannot stress this enough.<br><br>Tolkien really did create something beautiful. We have some of the best world building in history. Moreover, I find Tolkien to be a really easy read so it’s not something you’ll be breaking a sweat over.<br><br>Without a doubt Tolkien is someone you should read."
1692,J.R.R. Tolkien 4-Book Boxed Set: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"Frankly, this is the best fantasy book I ever read. The secondary world Tolkien created is believable and true to it own creation. It grips me every time I read it and this trilogy has carried me through every winter for the past 50 years!"
1693,J.R.R. Tolkien 4-Book Boxed Set: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings,J.R.R. Tolkien,3,"In many ways this has the same failings as the bible: Long-winded, confusing, too much violence, comes off preachy, an inaccurate historical piece, excessively moralistic and boring. But, like the bible, able to spawn some great movies. <br><br>Too much walking."
1694,J.R.R. Tolkien 4-Book Boxed Set: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,"My favoritestest series ever!!! I could lose myself in Middle Earth forever. I have read this series cover to cover during every life changing, painful period of my life. Yes, I have read it seven times."
