0,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"I’m going to do something that's a little disrespectful and start this review by talking about another fantasy series that I’ve enjoyed: A Song of Ice and Fire. That series rules. It has everything I’ve wanted in a series since Tolkien but there’s one thing to be said about it, neither good or bad, that is a big part of its impact: it is dark, very very dark. The darkness comes, as it should in all quality fiction, not necessarily from the actual bad things that happen to good people, but from t"
1,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"Anton Chekhov famously said that if an author mentions a gun, it had better go off at some point, a point often attributed to Raymond Chandler (who at least practiced this rule). The same goes for fantasy writers. Fantasy doesn't need to be all blood and whirling blades, but if a fantasy writer straps a broadsword to a character's side, it had better be drawn in anger, at some point.<br><br>This was one of the best fantasy novels I've read in a while, especially impressive as it's a first novel. It has"
2,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"I was up until half five yesterday morning reading intensely to finish off this story. I didn't write the review then as it would have been a tired, mumbled mess with little to no eloquence and it wouldn't have included any cool sounding words. Let's see how I get on now after a good nights sleep. Prior to reading this, I had completed Abercrombie's Shattered Sea trilogy and enjoyed it a lot. Where that was classic story focused fantasy with twists aplenty, this is best described as a macabre, d"
3,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,3,"Originally reviewed at <a href=""http://bookwraiths.com/2015/03/31/the-blade-itself-the-first-law-1-by-joe-abercrombie/"" rel=""nofollow"">Bookwraiths Reviews</a><br><br>As I’ve mentioned in other reviews, Joe Abercrombie is a fantasy author who all my real-life friends have raved about for years and insisted that I read. From their proselyting, it seemed that my life would not be complete without sampling Lord Grimdark’s wares. So, in order to save myself from some accursed fate, I read the first two novels in Abercrombie’s <i>Shattered Sea</i> series. <br><br>Unfortunately, grimwhine was not for me. If interested in the “why”, you ca"
4,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,1,"I almost put down the book when 3 paragraphs in the first 3 pages began with some version of this line:<br><br>""Shit,"" he said.<br><br>But I managed to slog through because I was told this was a some genre-breaking novel that didn't rely so heavily on typical fantasy clichés and it was supposed to be really dark and gritty. Instead of gritty, it felt kind of like a teenager who swears a lot to try and sound like an adult: really forced and usually out of context. A lot of the writing in general seemed to trip o"

6,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"Joe Abercrombie certainly knows how to write some disturbingly likable characters. In any other book the protagonists would be the bad guys. Logan Ninefingers is a brutal warrior who goes into insane blood rages where he kills anything, and everything, near him. Yet, weirdly, he is also a wise and sensitive soul. San Dan Glocka is a torturer whose heart is pure malice, yet somehow his attitude toward life boarders on the hilarious. These two are such great characters; they make the series what i"
7,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,3,"So this was one of my most anticipated reads. <br><br>Grimdark fans from all over offer up this book as one of the best in the genre, and so that understandably rocketed my expectations!<br><br><b>And this was not a bad book by any means.</b> <br><br>In fact, as soon as I started I was told multiple times that I could liken the first book of <i>The First Law</i> series to ""a giant prologue,"" and I think that's a really accurate way to describe it. <br><br>The book follows a handful of characters who are all entangled in some way in the dege"
8,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"The Blade Itself will undoubtedly become classic fantasy. I found it engrossing, and one of the best examples of the ""darker"" epic fantasies, with protagonists lacking in traditional heroic qualities and quests that are less than selfless. I liked the way the story was constructed, primarily following three main characters, with a fourth was added partway through the book. I was fairly certain they would intersect at some point, so part of the interest in the story is seeing how their individual"
9,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,"4.5/5 Stars<br><br>I started reading this because a lot of my friends recommend me if I wanted something like Song of Ice &amp; Fire series, this is the closest one, and imo they're right. This book follows the perspective of 3 main anti-heroes, believe me, you'll root for them when you read it. Logen Ninefinger, the Schizophrenia barbarian, Sand dan Glokta, once the best swordsman turned crippled and torturer and Jezal dan Luthar, the narcissistic fencer who wanted nothing more than fame.<br><br>The book start"

12,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"I can certainly say that this book is gritty. So, you start reading it and it pushes your face in mud, sweat and blood. If someone just falls somewhere or rolls down the stairs, you can be sure, it will be shown with all the glory of sticky stuff running down the face with an agonizing squirm. It reminds me of Tolkien or Sapowski in some episodes.<br>But this book is not just a merciless hole covered in darkness and blood.

13,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"It's been a while since I read a fantasy trilogy all the way through, back to back. Joe Abercrombie's The First Law series was too compelling not to finish in a single marathon. The first book, The Blade Itself, introduces a cast of well-developed, complex characters throw together in a world loosely based on medieval Europe. At first, it's not entirely clear what the major story line will be. It's also not clear who the good guys and bad guys are -- kind of like real life. If this sounds like A"
14,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"I'll start this review by saying that, currently, I have 197 Goodreads friends (which is really something, as I doubt there are even 50 people in my real life that I can stand). Out of those 197 friends, 59 of them have either read this book, or have it on their to-read shelf. That's 30%. Pretty much one in three.

I hate every character in it. I'm not interested in what's going on in the slightest. I keep making excuses not to read any more of it.

25,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,"It’s been a long time that I’m anticipating to start reading Abercrobie’s books, because they sound very appealing to me. To my surprise I didn’t find it dark nor grim as I thought, there’s lots of good humor and the atmosphere is relatively “calm” without any imminent cataclysm, or a world in the brink of total destruction. The world changes, but it looks like that it would take some time until we’ll witness dramatic changes in the world. As I see it, it’s more *light* fantasy than dark fantasy"
