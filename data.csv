0,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,i’m going to do something that s a little disrespectful and start this review by talking about another fantasy series that i’ve enjoyed a song of ice and fire that series rules it has everything i’ve wanted in a series since tolkien but there’s one thing to be said about it neither good or bad that is a big part of its impact it is dark very very dark the darkness comes as it should in all quality fiction not necessarily from the actual bad things that happen to good people but from t
1,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,anton chekhov famously said that if an author mentions a gun it had better go off at some point a point often attributed to raymond chandler who at least practiced this rule the same goes for fantasy writers fantasy doesn t need to be all blood and whirling blades but if a fantasy writer straps a broadsword to a character s side it had better be drawn in anger at some point this was one of the best fantasy novels i ve read in a while especially impressive as it s a first novel it has
2,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,i was up until half five yesterday morning reading intensely to finish off this story i didn t write the review then as it would have been a tired mumbled mess with little to no eloquence and it wouldn t have included any cool sounding words let s see how i get on now after a good nights sleep prior to reading this i had completed abercrombie s shattered sea trilogy and enjoyed it a lot where that was classic story focused fantasy with twists aplenty this is best described as a macabre d
3,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,3,originally reviewed at bookwraiths reviews as i’ve mentioned in other reviews joe abercrombie is a fantasy author who all my real life friends have raved about for years and insisted that i read from their proselyting it seemed that my life would not be complete without sampling lord grimdark’s wares so in order to save myself from some accursed fate i read the first two novels in abercrombie’s shattered sea series unfortunately grimwhine was not for me if interested in the “why” you ca
4,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,3,so this was one of my most anticipated reads grimdark fans from all over offer up this book as one of the best in the genre and so that understandably rocketed my expectations and this was not a bad book by any means in fact as soon as i started i was told multiple times that i could liken the first book of the first law series to a giant prologue and i think that s a really accurate way to describe it the book follows a handful of characters who are all entangled in some way in the dege
5,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,1,i almost put down the book when num paragraphs in the first num pages began with some version of this line shit he said but i managed to slog through because i was told this was a some genre breaking novel that didn t rely so heavily on typical fantasy clichés and it was supposed to be really dark and gritty instead of gritty it felt kind of like a teenager who swears a lot to try and sound like an adult really forced and usually out of context a lot of the writing in general seemed to trip o
6,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4, so let s cast the characters for our novel shall we of course boss mr abercrombie sir where is the run of a mill farmboy with a great destination i m afraid he ran of the mill met a goblin now rots in a ditch oh how unfortunate indeed boss indeed let s see what about the maiden fair in need of rescue from a dragon apparently she ate the dragon now she was saying something about a burning sensation in the well digesting area went to the toilet never saw her again
7,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,joe abercrombie certainly knows how to write some disturbingly likable characters in any other book the protagonists would be the bad guys logan ninefingers is a brutal warrior who goes into insane blood rages where he kills anything and everything near him yet weirdly he is also a wise and sensitive soul san dan glocka is a torturer whose heart is pure malice yet somehow his attitude toward life boarders on the hilarious these two are such great characters they make the series what i
8,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,the blade itself will undoubtedly become classic fantasy i found it engrossing and one of the best examples of the darker epic fantasies with protagonists lacking in traditional heroic qualities and quests that are less than selfless i liked the way the story was constructed primarily following three main characters with a fourth was added partway through the book i was fairly certain they would intersect at some point so part of the interest in the story is seeing how their individual

12,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,i can certainly say that this book is gritty so you start reading it and it pushes your face in mud sweat and blood if someone just falls somewhere or rolls down the stairs you can be sure it will be shown with all the glory of sticky stuff running down the face with an agonizing squirm it reminds me of tolkien or sapowski in some episodes but this book is not just a merciless hole covered in darkness and blood you can find a lot of fun humor slight or hard and that just makes the book
13,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,it s been a while since i read a fantasy trilogy all the way through back to back joe abercrombie s the first law series was too compelling not to finish in a single marathon the first book the blade itself introduces a cast of well developed complex characters throw together in a world loosely based on medieval europe at first it s not entirely clear what the major story line will be it s also not clear who the good guys and bad guys are kind of like real life if this sounds like a

18,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,distrustful the blade itself is the first book of the first law trilogy which is an epic supernatural fantasy adventure it can’t be helped to compare the trilogy to the song of ice and fire game of thrones series in its depth of detail its rollcall of wonderful characters hidden plots and agendas and fantasy dimensions the world of joe abercrombie it told in superb vivid detail where multiple cultures and nations are warring and untrustworthy of the other but there is the darker menace

22,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,1,i tried to read this book i really did i got over halfway through but i just can t go any further it s too damn boring and pointless i hate every character in it i m not interested in what s going on in the slightest i keep making excuses not to read any more of it a good story is about interesting people doing interesting things and this one lacked both of those things i should never have to force myself to keep reading i should be excited and compelled to read by what s going on and
23,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,life—the way it really is—is a battle not between good and bad but between bad and worse ’ joseph brodsky i know i would love this book when i read the synopsis and am glad this book lived up to expectations never have i seen grey characters portrayed perfectly the characters are so amiable that its easy to overlook their morals the book is also original well written battle scenes cultures good dose of romance diversity etc world building and writing i always appreciate a good world build
24,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,2,num num/num i had avoided this book for awhile despite all the good things i d heard about it primarily because i was afraid that the gritty realism proclaimed about in the book amounted to bleak and disheartening i read for entertainment and i don t read to be depressed about the darker parts of human nature because i m quite familiar with them already quite frankly and so i saw this book and thought not for me but still when you see a book recommended by seemingly everyone time and
25,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,it’s been a long time that i’m anticipating to start reading abercrobie’s books because they sound very appealing to me to my surprise i didn’t find it dark nor grim as i thought there’s lots of good humor and the atmosphere is relatively “calm” without any imminent cataclysm or a world in the brink of total destruction the world changes but it looks like that it would take some time until we’ll witness dramatic changes in the world as i see it it’s more light fantasy than dark fantasy

30,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,this is definitely one of those awesome non typical fantasy novel there s no knight in shining armor there s no maniacally laughing villain there s no battle of good against evil and i honestly still have no idea what the hell is going on some art from the series comic adaptation even though this book read more like a giant prologue than an actual installment of its own i loved it to pieces yes it was slow at times yes you feel like nothing much has happened overall but damn it if those
31,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,the book that made me read it until two hours after midnight and i had to wake up at five because i had to go to work trust me when the book drew you into the story you certainly will not stop reading the story is great and just drew me to read it even though i was short of time to read i used every moment of my free time to read it until the end writer joe abercrombie in this book collected the troupe of characters who are literally not just ordinary from the very first magician bayaz w
32,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,when it comes to an epic tale with moral clarity set in a supremely realised fantasy world he tolkien pretty much knocked it out of the park but that means there’s not much point in my writing it again is there forgive me for saying so but it feels as if folk have been writing lord of the rings again for a while now and i think we could probably you know stop joe abercrombie bankrupt nihilism blog the above quote is the author s response to a columnist s criticism that his work

35,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,here is the background there was a rumor that said that abercrombie’s books start with the weakest and grow i guess i am odd that way because i actually loved this first installment the skill of an author to slowly unfold the story the factions political complexities in a city and outside the ability to use characters that you see in many books and make them relatable the ability to create one or two unique characters and make them incredibly unique finally the audiobook was extremely

37,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,3,i am trying to figure out what this book is missing for me there s nothing that makes me angry about it there s plenty to like and yet still although i read it and mostly enjoyed it the first half of the book is already fading in my mind and i don t see any reason to ever re read it i ll probably read the rest in the series and this is perfectly competent fantasy it s just not enough note the rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the changes in goodreads policy and enforceme

44,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,this book came complete with a plethora of glowing reviews and commendations fortunately for once these seem to have been well founded the blade itself brings a sense of awe to the table something sorely lacking in contemporary fantasy of course there are many many books that i still have to read i m very much a supporter of old school fantasy and this novel seems to be a happy meeting of modern and classical what makes this novel especially appealing are the characters and specif
45,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,3,sometimes you just need to curl up under the duvet with a mug of lempsip and some epic fantasy this one did the job nicely the characters are all objectively speaking dislikable people but enjoyable for all that in a blackadder kind of way – i had fun casting them in my head the writing style is blunt and efficient with an identifiably british tone leavening the ‘grim darkness’ a strain of dark wit and frequent uses of the interjection ‘er—’ suggest that terry pratchett and pg wodehou
46,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,3,the blade itself never really managed to grip me i only cared for glokta i wasn t interested in any of the other characters and wasn t sure what the plot tried to do i m almost worried to admit that yes i was bored i ve been told that this is a difficult/unfortunate start to an otherwise amazing series and i must say i am tempted to read the remaining books maybe if i like them i ll try this one again afterwards just to see how it holds up once i ve seen the entire story unfold perhaps

50,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,i was very impressed by the immersion into the characters and the unconventional choice of the inquisitor everyone grew on me including him the setting was beautifully illustrated and i genuinely think that the build up to an epic battle was smooth as silk it didn t feel contrived or hacked it felt inevitable the hints at great workings of power and magic were truly enticing that being said it s obviously a part of a greater work of fiction and there weren t any major plot advances in th
51,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,i loved this book the narrator steven pacey was brilliant and the story itself was excellent i loved the touches of humour which made me laugh out loud and some of the characterisation was just superb all of the main characters are damaged in some way some of them are just plain evil and yet we also see their good sides and in the end there are no goodies and baddies just people by the end of the book there is no choice by but to move on to the next in the series because you just have

56,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,this is a prime slice of grimdark fantasy it’s important to state that right away – if you like your fantasy light where to quote oscar wilde the good end happily the bad unhappily than don’t bother this book is not for you if however you like fantasy harsh and uncompromising the darkness occasionally lightened by flashes of the blackest humour than i think you might well enjoy this although the overarching plot is clearly that of a trilogy the feeling of threads coming together the
57,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,3,confession time epic fantasy is not one of my go to genres while i can appreciate the appeal of escaping into a medieval world filled with knights and wizards and a veritable smörgåsbords of mystical creatures for me there was always some disconnect which prevented me from fully immersing into those types of stories i read a few arthurian tales as a child but i ventured no further i never played dungeons dragons world of warcraft or any of those big fantasy games with the immense

61,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,this was a fantastic book which only missed the five star mark due to the lack of a proper ending it s a major pet peeve of mine but didn t bother me as much as it usually does it wasn t a cliffhanger ending it didn t just stop but it didn t really resolve as such i m looking forward to the next in the series i ve seen a few discussions lately about the definition of dark fantasy and for me this is it it was dark and gritty and violent and more than a few scenes stayed with me long afte

65,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,a political drama with a lot of power games and surplus of graphic violence there is very little magic and the plot is more character driven it is reminiscent of quentin tarantino films with its dark story humor and shady characters you carry on that s what he d always done that s the task that comes with surviving whether you deserve to live or not you remember the dead as best as you can you say some words for them then you carry on and you hope for better before i
66,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,3,this book was like watching someone setting up a chess board very very slowly and methodically and for most of its length that s what it was getting all the characters where they needed to be so that their journey could begin it wasn t until late in the narrative when all of the pieces were in place when the opening moves finally happened that it truly became an exciting read the stakes weren t known early enough to really drive the book forward a true sense of the mysteries of this un

68,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,1,if you re serious about good fiction and are educated in storytelling don t believe all of the praise for the blade itself abercrombie s trilogy has been getting a lot of buzz in fantasy circles most readers call it unconventional fantasy the back cover of my edition calls it noir fantasy and the loftiest of readers call it literary fantasy i don t find any of these terms oxymoronic but they are all applied incorrectly to this book the blade itself is as uninteresting and cliche

71,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,this was simply an amazing book made even more so by the reading in the audible version by steven pacey his ability to change voice for each character was fascinating and really added to the presentation of the entire story i had no problem differentiating between the main characters and the supporting characters as well it was amazing to hear him switch between all of the accents necessary for the characters and where they were from while this is set in a fantasy world depending upon t

76,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,read the full review on impressionblend com what s interesting about the blade itself is how character driven the entire novel is while there are a few important events throughout the story what the readers will remember most are the characters and believe me when i tell you that the crippled torturer is going to be your favorite glokta s perspective is very unusual and saying he is a morally gray character barely scratches the surface—comparing what he says to what he doesn t say was o
79,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,wow what a brilliant book i came into the first law trilogy excepting more grit and grimdark themes than i m used to which was definitely fulfilled but there was so much more joe abercrombie quickly presented view point characters all very distinguishable and all that i loved to read i was equally excited for chapters from logen jezal ferra and glokta especially glokta which is rare in books i d say another aspect of the novel that caught me off guard was the humor so much sarcasm

84,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,judging solely from the description on the back i m not sure i would have commited to reading this but it came with a glowing recommendation from a friend and i m glad i listened the novel is just well written and while its not entirely surprising it is exciting abercrombie writes action scenes vividly succinctly and deftly avoids the laziness some writers fall prey to i ll be reading the second book right away 
85,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,this is a series i’ve been meaning to start for a while for two reasons the first being it was the one that hooked one of my friends into fantasy reading the second that i heard fans of mark lawrence’s work would enjoy abercrombie’s i have to say this was a good read the blade itself starts off with a literal cliff hanger that sets the stage for the tense and dramatic novel that follows having read mark lawrence’s prince of thorns earlier this year i was expecting a dark and gritty novel w
86,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,i usually prefer stand alone books or series that take place with the same characters or setting but don t leave you hanging at the end of the book the kind of sf f series that i like include the dresden files by jim butcher the company by kage baker and charles delint s newford stories i have to say that the blade itself isn t like any of these it s also not like series that go on and on without end it doesn t meander like the lord of the rings or take ten volumes and counting like s
87,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,joe abercrombie needs to find the person responsible who might have misplaced the last num num pages of this book just before it was to be published but i have a feeling that he might not have to go much far to do so a mirror would serve just as well as hercule poirot in this case yes the book ends abruptly but such is the curse of reading epic fantasy apart from that i enjoyed this book quite a lot especially the character glokta the inquisitor the torturer his dry wit reminded me a
88,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,num/num a great entry into a series with lots of potential great world building and some fantastic characters straight from the off with the introduction i was hooked the writing was excellent and the action was very well described this was all within the first num pages the three main characters are well described and fleshed out that is pretty much the purpose of the novel it feels like a getting the band together sort of book with no real overall plot or resolution which is why i couldn t r
89,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,3,another book which i was convinced i will love but did not up to around num i was in a continuous snort with laughter really amusing and one hell of a character – glotka afterwards the laughter kinda vanished and i ended up dragging myself toward the finish because nothing happened it feels like a huge prologue in which we get to meet a bunch of very different characters gathered to pursue some goal in a future journey so no worldbuilding not much on the characters history and really
90,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,the blade itself focuses around a barbarian warrior an inexperienced soldier an inquisitor and a wizard this all sounds quite familiar but rather than a standard epic fantasy this book is a grimdark fantasy being grimdark the familiar characters types are quite different than people might expect the barbarian warrior is actually a friendly man logen ninefingers who s tired of fighting but can t seem to escape it the inexperienced soldier jezal dan luthar is a character so pompous and arr
92,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,i like to read science fiction and i like to read literature with a capital l and in that pursuit i encounter all sorts of strangeness all sorts of experimentation in form and character and language and idea in radiance for example i encountered walden esque chapters that were just shipping manifests or in money a suicide note i encountered such mundanely unpleasant characters such banal evil that i concluded the narrative’s sole purpose was to provide a vehicle for the peddling of h
93,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,the blade itself is pure entertainment from cover to cover don t let all the grimdark talk fool you this book has as many laughs as it does gut wounds big thanks to orbit/hachette audio for my audiobook copy of the blade itself in exchange for an honest review the blade itself is joe abercrombie s debut novel first published back in num it s the first book of the first law trilogy the blade itself follows the trials and trevails of three viewpoint characters “blood gets you nothing but more
94,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,wow this book rocks the audio book is well performed the characters the worldbuilding plot and descriptions are wonderfully well crafted this book is my first encounter with mr abercrombie s work the blade itself is a delightful introduction there is so much to the story i have hard time even trying to comment on it i love the characters whether it is the brooding glokta or the aging logen ninefingers or the savage young woman ferro just to name a few of the extensive cast of characters
95,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,num num stars middling rating with the potential to change after reading books num and num read this review and check out the podcast at book geeks uncompromised murderous conspiracies rise to the surface old scores are ready to be settled and the line between hero and villain is sharp enough to draw blood the quality of the characters in this book is easily its strongest aspect all of the point of view characters with the possible exception of one are remarkably well written and well rounded jezal
96,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,buddy read with robin alexa jessica kat jennifer athena and eon this book was all kinds of epic it was the bare bones of what high fantasy should be more so than anything i’ve read in a long time this book was truly the embodiment of a good fantasy novel it had all the elements the magic the “heroes” the anti heroes the strong female characters and the mythical straight up scary as hell creatures never before have i found myself rooting for a torturer and root for him i did 
97,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,2,the blade itself is the first in a trilogy and it takes its time building up a vivid sense of the setting it gives us plenty of time to get to know the characters in their current flawed states rather than jumping immediately into the changes they ll go through normally this would sound boring but abercrombie s descriptive powers are impressive he gets you involved at a level that is rare bringing you close to the characters physically as well as emotionally this adds depth giving a fee
98,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5, num num glotka is creepy wonderful got this out of the way now about the book it is a grim fantasy with characters who are realistically imperfect in a world full of violence and magic is rare so rare in fact that when an old mage makes a comeback his power and identity are disbelieved and his sincerity questioned there are rich poor influential noble farmers soldiers barbarians and multiple racial characters their respective storylines intercepting in ways which will obviously
99,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,an exciting story with lots of solid loveable characters glokta is my husbando very well written with a lot of laugh out loud moments i accompanied the read with the audiobook narrated by steven pacey who did an amazing job at enhancing the whole reading experience by some num view spoiler [ west had often told jezal that the northmen found in adua usually skulking dishevelled by the docks or dirty drunk in gutters were by no means typical of their people those that lived free in th
100,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,joe abercrombie’s ‘the blade itself’ is his debut novel and the first in his ‘the first law’ series ‘the blade itself’ is a bloody and bloodied tale of high hopes and stakes dashed dreams and brains and more knives than a battalion of butchers a barbarian a torturer and a nobleman walk into a bar…sounds like the start to a bad joke wrong it’s the start of a bloody good story in ‘the blade itself’ the veritable menagerie of characters are led into the depths of plot twists and turns pla
101,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,this book was pretty incredible i absolutely adored reading about every single character no matter what kind of dark messed up stuff they d done abercrombie somehow manages to make all of them extremely well definied from their first appearance and continues to make them compelling and fascinating through to the last pages even if there were characters i didn t particularly like i still found myself itching to find out what kind anitcs they were going to get up to next revelling in every
102,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,i wasn t sure what to expect when i started this book joe abercrombie has been described to me as a writer of dark and cynical novels but i discovered long ago that books don t strike me as dark and cynical the same way as most people in any case this series came highly recommended so i gave it a shot for the most part i felt that the book was very well written even though the story was a little weak for my taste it most definitely had that first book to a series feel for me but to
103,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,personal rating num num i am obsessed this is one of the hardest books i’ve had to rate in a while these characters felt so real and i loved them all so much but this entire book felt like the beginning of something bigger it solely created a huge mysterious world and these characters that are all teetering on the edge of bad and worse yet loveable i think i need to dock a star because of the prologue feel the entire way through but this hurts me because i loved it i can only expect the plo
104,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,oh man what great start this series started a little slow for me but man did it get better as i continued to listen and i must make note that i did listen to the audio version which was fantastic steven pacey was magnificent at crafting a great deal of different voices that hardly ever sounded the same the main characters could not have been a greater cast to listen to from their struggles to their triumphs i was enthralled to the last moment i think i just have to dive into the next one
105,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,really appreciated it more this time around a bloody good time 
106,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,3,edit i ve knocked this down to three stars as i never got going with the series and have mostly forgotten the book less than a year on it was still enjoyable at the time but i ve nothing that s drawing me back to the world right now so think that this is a more suitable rating an excellent start to a series that s a little on the slow side but has enough quality characters and excellent writing to draw you in and make sure you ll stick around for the ride this is an extremely character focus
107,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,so my first reading of abercrombies work turned up a great read and a series that i am really looking forward to getting my teeth into a lot of people will say that this is dark and gritty there are scenes that made a lot of readers uncomfortable but i had no such problems reading this book if you have read malazan or the black company you will not find this too dark the difference for most readers i suspect is that the usual pain and cruelty is inflicted on our protagonists or the genera
108,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,1,i cannot properly express how painful a read this was for me i should have known from the struggle i had just to make it through the first few chapters if you asked me what happened in this novel my answer would be something like a bunch of unlikeable and/or boring characters get introduced there is a lot of swearing and gratuitous violence other than that i have zero clue as to what the whole point was there seemed to be no plot all just a bunch of terrible horrible characters runni
109,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,1,i had high hopes for this book but six hours in it s an audible book and i m still waiting for something interesting to happen—for my own personalized definition of interesting yeah there s fighting and torture and desperate journeys with few resources and even something of a budding romance but all these things are jumbled together with constant point of view shifts and no hint of a central narrative to tie things together all of which i could put up with if the characters were engaging
110,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,2,a lot of people on my friend list are going to dislike this review i went into the blade itself with high expectations unfortunately it just didn t hold my interest i put this book down so many times i eventually had to force myself to read it the only reason i didn t give up on with was because of the promise of many that the series got better those same people also told me that glokta is one of the greatest characters ever personally i found him so irritating he s really just a grumpy
111,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,stunning stuff cleverly written with a sense of humour running throughout the book many characters with nothing initially to do with anything to do with each other coming up with the same quotes in their head provides much of the humour in the novel e g you have to be practical about these things and i hate stairs etc always produces a laugh the characters are all very well rounded and no one is perfect in fact there are some scenes that are quite shocking considering what has gone on be
112,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,dark and humourus loads of interesting characters very real/ raw for that medieval ish period i was bored with a few like jazel or whatever his name is but as a whole the story seems to make epic turns ferro and logen are my favourite up to the next hopefully some more of this “the man screamed and screamed behind his mask and the bloody nine laughed and twisted the blade logen might have pitied him but logen was far away and the bloody nine had no more pity in him than the winter
113,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,i feel like i might be a little on the kind side giving this four stars there were parts that were very good and interesting overall there was too much grimdark check list going on that said at least abercrombie has good prose which is something that can t be said for much of fantasy these days it also doesn t ramble on about unimportant content which is a huge plus i can tell this is working into being a great series so definitely will continue what does the title mean anyway what
114,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,2,i m underwhelmed i wasn t able to get invested in anything i didn’t care about the fate of the world since i knew nothing about it see i understand the need to avoid infodumps and then there is this new tendency in fantasy to keep it action packed and fast paced however there is a pitfall i know nothing about what s going on in the beginning it didn t appear close enough to our world for me to be able to project previous experience onto it later it turns out to be a bit too similar
116,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,ah so this is how swords and sorcery fantasy should be done say one thing for logen ninefingers say he s one of the most feared barbarians of the north he leads a pack of named men so famous they re used as boogeymen to scare little children only problem is he gets separated from his crew who assume with good reason that he s gone back to the mud i e dead as a doornail he likewise assumes with good reason they ve gone back to the mud so he goes off on his own into the north that
117,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,there was a moment about num num of the way into the book that i realized that the blade itself is something special it is a rare treat of a book so very good it was simply a pleasure to read five unadulterated stars no qualifiers no caveats five stars first the back drop a storm is brewing centered around the mighty sprawling union a sort of more powerful effective holy roman empire of the high middle ages to the north a new warlord has united the disunited tribes of the northlan
118,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,“has it ever occured to you master ninefingers that a sword is different from other weapons axes and maces and so forth are lethal enough but they hang on the belt like dumb brutes but a sword a sword has a voice sheathed it has little to say to be sure but you need only put your hand on the hilt and it begins to whisper in your enemy s ear a gentle word a word of caution do you hear it now compare it to the sword half drawn it speaks louder does it not it hisses a dire threat 
119,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,well the hype seems to have been warranted for this fantasy series the blade itself is typical book one fare in that a good deal of it lays down the groundwork for a trilogy another trilogy there ought to be a law that fantasy readers receive three times the lifespan because damn near every story has to be a f ing trilogy i ask myself why do i even bother but then the answer is simple fantasy is that genre that is the ultimate in escapism and when a story enfolds you to the point where
120,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,i am subtracting a star from my review solely because the book ends on a cliffhanger no it would be closer to say it ends at a beginning the fellowship of characters that bayaz and his apprentice bring together logen jezal ferro and brother longfoot isn t successfully accomplished until the final chapters and they don t leave for their epic quest to the edge of the world until the book closes so this book functions as a num page character study or prequel for the reader to fam
121,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,i would describe this as being a character driven epic fantasy it follows multiple characters across different settings some of whom cross paths almost always painfully the focus is always on the characters none of whom are simple or clear cut in any way in a similar way to george rr martin the typical fantasy good/bad black/white tropes are thrown out the window and instead we are treated to characters with real depth following the exploits of three fairly unsavoury yet oddly endearing
122,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,3,everything frightens me and it s well that it does fear is a good friend to the hunted it s kept me alive this long the dead are fearless and i don t care to join them consider this part of my break a hiatus one necessitated by a hard boil on the work front this volume didn t elicit much thought on poetry or politics the novel isn t poorly constructed it actually shines in terms of dialogue and inner monologue while it fails the bechdel test the blade itself is an even handed approach
123,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,simply loved it abercrombie is just amazing in his writing he described the characters and plot so beautifully that you can just admire him for that lots of cursing and swearing 
124,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,i read this trilogy a few years ago around the same time as i read scott lynch and i was totally excited about the new voices in fantasy at the time i remembered that much and also that this was very much “grimdark” and gritty and portrayed a not so pleasant world but i knew i’d have to reread it at least for my own personal satisfaction before i finally get round to other works in the same world with the vague memories i have of the first time i read this trilogy it’s apparent just fro
125,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,excellent book great plot great characters very well written once all the plotlines came together i had a hard time putting it down read for the first time in num gave it five stars then for some reason went off classic fantasy now that i am back dabbling with fantasy i decided to re read it imagine my surprise when i realised that i remember virtually nothing of this book not even the roughest plot outline it was like reading a new book three very different main characters with ver
127,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,this review is for the entire first law trilogy while george rr martin has been slumping with the last two books of the song of ice and fire series and playing footsie with hbo joe abercrombie is writing fantasy the way it should be written unapologetic edgy filled with intrigue and amazing battle scenes i can t express just how good these books were you ll just have to read them for yourselves frankly i m jealous that you are going to get to experience them for the first time joe aber
128,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,loved it did this as an audiobook this one started slow for me but the narration of steven pacy would make phone contract boilerplate sound rich and interesting so i kept going and i m glad i did abercrombie has lots of room to do very deep character development and he takes advantage of it halfway through i could see what all the fuss was about and the second i finished book i i bought books ii iii it s rare for me to read a book ii in a series simply because there are so many
129,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,simply one of my favorite trilogies of all time joe abercrombie has created a very dirty real and believable world the story has several main characters that we get to know and to love what makes this series so unique is its ability to blur the lines the good guys and bad guys do right and wrong and make things very grey and make it difficult for us to differntiate the two i highly recommend this series to all adult fantasy lovers that are looking for a deeply engrossing raw and thri
131,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,sven hassel/glen cook stylish action checked all kind of good great bad awful heroes checked luxuriant exotic bloody grimy plot checked tons of blood gore smashed skulls slahed necks spilled guts checked plenty of dark healthy humour checked awsome checked one of the best fantasy ever read checked more abercrombie novels i can t wait to read checked 
132,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,i really enjoyed this book and am excited for some more glokta the only thing i truly regret about this novel is waiting so long to start it 
133,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,buddy read with robin athena alexa jessica kat ashley eon what makes high fantasy so enjoyable to me is also what makes it difficult to review it s so dense and so much happens yet as others have pointed out so little happens this novel is no different in that it doesn t have a central plot other than the overarching threat of war between each kingdom so much as it has lesser character driven plots that eventually converge into the whole in the background we have political intrigu
134,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,num num stars i m in love with num so far and as i m a really positive person i m now waiting for the moment it will start to go down because come on my whole year can t be only num and num stars book can it i m glad i took my time and didn t rush the reading of this book last summer when i had zero time to focus on anything because i d have missed on something big this first volume of the first law series was everything i expected from a fan favourite and more more because i was secretly
136,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,if i ever met mr abercrombie i m going to ask him a question what i want to know is if his character of the northman logen ninefingers is based in part at least on marvel s wolverine that said this book is a different type of fantasy there s magic there s lots of violence not too much romance in fact i wouldn t call it romance but teenage love and lots of dark humor and jabs at politics while abercrombie uses politics in a different manner than jacqueline carey did in her kushiel s
137,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,2,being a big fan of martin and tolkein s epics i picked up joe abercrombie s first book the blade itself of his first law trilogy the book follows a mix of characters who are brought together or are fighting against in order to embark on a still unknown adventure while there is a lot of action the book is ultimately disappointing in its writing story and characters the writing from a purely technical point of view makes the reader embarassed even moreso upon reading this guilty plea
138,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,i almost wasn t going to read this certain words conjur certain memories and the word barbarian was used a couple of times in the synopsis i couldn t get the image of a very num s schwartzenegger with long hair and a sword out of my head but i figured there had to be a reason it has such a great overall rating so i relented totally my bad for putting this off oh and if you re interested amazon at least the canadian version has the series on for num/book right now that s always a great
139,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,damn it was good ❦ this book made me suffer at the beginning num pages of worldbuilding presenting the many characters and nothing happened at all and then i started to connect with the characters through their past i started to understand why they acted the way they acted or at least some of them only when i was halfway through the story i started to grasp the plot and i took me even longer to see the big picture as a hole and i’m sure i’ve barely scratched the surface ❦ let me start
142,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,i expected violence and brutality for shock value alone i have heard there are no likable characters in this book i thought i would not like it but i ended up loving it the characters have their faults they re not romantic fantasy stereotypes they are the ugly thoughts we all have whether we admit to them or not our sins vanity envy wrath but they are the good in us as well the brutal barbarian who wants to step away from his violent past the vain knight who wants to become worthy
143,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,this was an fbr buddy read this book was really just a setup/foundation for things to come and i didn t even realize for nearly half the book because i was just having so much fun listening to the characters except jezel between glokta west ardee logen ninefingers his northman crew bayaz and his apprentice and farrow and her guide i just had a grin on my face half the time and then the ending came along and gave a taste of the action to come can t wait to continue with befor
144,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,i really liked this book great characters great pace great action i couldn t believe i was rooting for a torturer and a spoiled brat noble 
146,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,3, edit i read what i wrote about this novel two days ago and i could tell my review was a late night rant of annoyance not very readable maybe someday i ll fix it up but for now i m leaving it it actually mirrors the annoying way abercrombie tread water in this book for almost num pages i finished this book for a gr club read and i am really annoyed i wanted to like this i am guessing the author decided to stretch out his material into a trilogy when he had only enough for two books so h

151,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,also posted on my blog rinn reads i have to say after finally reading the first book in the first law series by joe abercrombie i now understand why he is ‘lord grimdark’ the blade itself felt like a whirlwind of a book despite probably being the slower of the three as it builds things up of course i was expecting the book to be grisly but it was definitely grimmer and darker than i thought it would be – and that’s no bad thing there are several points of view within the story and each
152,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,one thing is for sure if abercrombie ever writes a travel guide i m going to read every letter every single letter no author has ever gotten me this involved in a book that doesn t yet seem to have a real plot of some kind i m sure the plot is there but that doesn t seem to be all that important in book num so whether abercrombie is a master storyteller remains to be seen but he definitely has my vote when it comes to descriptive writing to me this book is more setting the stage than
154,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,the blade itself is a fantasy novel about … well a host of characters and the parts they play in this tale of feuds conspiracies and wars set in a vicious world with well established cultures and classes magic and science superstitions and beliefs the bad stuff the only bad thing about this book is it comes to an end and leaves you wanting more the good stuff this book has a full cast of characters from logen ninefingers bayaz and jezal dan luthar to major collem west sand dan glokta
155,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,ooh i loved this the writing is excellent aside from the author s mild preoccupation with teeth great characterizations and that s almost all there is in this first part of the trilogy which might not suit everyone but i was enchanted the fight scenes are vivid and seem very realistic perhaps because they involve nearly as many accidental and incidental injuries as deliberate ones there s some dry humor but the overall tone is pretty dark the plot itself offers just enough deviation f
156,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,alright after some sleep the mind is brighter so i started reading it a week or little more ago and wasn t too impressed i mean i liked it very well but it didn t stick out as exceptional though it seemed interesting that changed abruptly after a hundred or so pages in when all the characters started to cross each other s paths it may also have had something to do with my reading longer sections at a time rather than a chapter at a time at brief stolen moments it definitely is a book th
157,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,i loved it what an ending i can t wait to start before they are hanged the only reason i gave it num stars is that in the beginning of the book i struggled a bit with the pacing another great br at buddies books and baubles reread february num for some reason i didn t mind the pacing at all this time around probably because i knew what to expect abercrombie is the master of grimdark i love dark tales and since i was familiar with the plot i found myself enjoying many of the finer detail

170,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,the best books often confuse you demand that you step back and reassess your thinking on how literature should be written i m not ashamed to say that i put abercrombies the blade itself down for a couple of months because the narrative style was frustrating me and the book wasn t giving me the pop culture relief that i was particularly craving sometimes the best boooks make you do this i recall being so angry with gene wolfe at times that i d swear off his fucking dense annoying often d

176,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,3,the book started out well with a curiously cheerful tone for a grimdark novel but it petered out from part ii onwards owing mostly to the dialogue which isn’t so good too much use of exclamations of the “er…” “huh” “well” sort and often risible or unnatural sounding conversations and that the prose is just passable didn t help what s wrong with the prose i wouldn t say it s bad all round it s more the storytelling than the writing itself because abercrombie is a tad too much of a t

178,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,abercrombie can really write i have read gritty takes on epic fantasy but rarely do they offer much humor likewise most comic takes offer little seriousness and go for broad satire abercrombie manages to be consistently humorous without losing a moment of seriousness or brutality this isn’t innovative in most of its elements barbarians invading from the north fading magic a grumpy wizard a grotesque character that is oddly lovable a group of misfits pulled together to go on a quest an
179,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,1,i really don t get the hype about this author i read g r r m s asoiaf and some other fans recommended this book i was disappointed it s just not good writing people like it because it s dark and violent and gritty which i agree can bring something to a fantasy series but when it s used as clumsily as abercrombie uses it and you see how weak the rest of the plot/characters/general writing is it s hard to continue to make sure i wasn t missing anything i read the whole book through and
180,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,at first it felt a bit dry but that is normal after reading so many mark lawrence books even mark lawrence’s superb prose felt a bit dry too at first after r scott bakker i’m a serial reader who doesn’t take breaks between books so i read through the book hangovers and it takes a few chapters before i really get into a new series this book starts with a bang but where i really got immensed into the story was when glokta came into play he is the star character of the book sand dan glokta
181,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,revised after finishing the trilogy absolutely one of the finest stories i ve ever read original review good but maybe a bit flawed seemed to be lacked an main antagonist or a central thrust of plot perhaps if viewed differently as the first third of a single book not a first book of a trilogy doesn t really seem to want to stand together well on it s own i liked bits of it a lot esp the parts with logan ninefingers and bayaz or even major west still no idea what bayaz is up to or why
182,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,not since jumping into michael sullivan s riyria reading and listening through audible have i had such an enjoyable adventure aside very impressed with steven pacey s narration wow the pacing dark and gritty characterization and attention to detail is what grabbed me out of this first book while sullivan s worldbuilding is more detailed imo i feel abercrombie really nailed his characters making us love and hate all at the same time note not to say sullivan didn t do the same thi
183,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,since sanderson i haven t enjoyed fantasy this much although it s pretty much different then the work of before mentioned author it s dark gritty full of violence and bloody battles but it is outstanding one i ve no doubt much more will come in sequels so i m going straigth for the second book i have to mention that whole experience was absolutely fantastic thanks to steven pacey narration and i must add the best one i ve listened to in audible books recommended 
184,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,3,well written i can clearly see why abercrombie appeals to so many not my bag though too much violence for violence sake
185,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,this was a re read via audiobook it was narrated brilliantly but i for some reason preferred the book pacing perhaps still a great read though 
188,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,a promising start to a new fantasy series by a new writer at first glance the book has a similarity to many other fantasies currently doing the rounds the book has been sold as ‘gritty heroic fantasy’ though there are subtle differences enough here to make it better than a run of the mill fantasy one of the key themes through the book seems to be about heroism from a number of different perspectives the book starts with logen ninefingers so called because he is missing the middle finger of
190,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,this book was awesome be warned if you read this review because it will be so full of praise that it might at times read like i was paid to say these things disclaimer i was not i just really really enjoyed it this book was definitely the best book i ve read so far this year and it s already moved up my list of favorites quite quickly i took to the story and the characters so quickly that i was only about halfway through the book before i had already decided i absolutely needed to kn
191,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,this is my first abercrombie book and one that has wallowed in my to read pile for several years now my reaction wow the plot of the book isn t anything new or fancy really it s secondary world grimdark fantasy with barbarians snobbish politicians and nebulous ancient threats working their way south what makes this book are the characters they are vivid and complex and become even more so when viewed through the points of view of the other characters the best example of this is glok
193,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,one of the things i loved about this book is that it felt so different from most anything else i have been reading lately the world structure beliefs and magic all felt unique while still feeling organic and the characters the fact that abercrombie made me love these characters is a feat unto itself the story revolves through the perspective of several different people and none of them are particularly likable upon first meeting however he never apologizes for these characters he never
195,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,when on the first page of the blade itself a major character went ‘eeek ’ as he avoided a spear thrust i nearly put it aside my feeling was one of ‘oh ffs not another fantasy with a central silly character who bumbles through the plot tripping over his magic sword squealing and running away then managing to destroy the [insert relevant baddy] through pure luck ’ but the writing was engaging and i carried on this particular character developed into one who really wouldn’t go ‘eeek ’ so i w
196,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,3,num num read this one with lys dreams and cari uhm i actually liked the characters even if they were all extremely blood thirsty and crazy but i feel like nothing happened for most of the book i get it that they had to meet at some point but i would have liked it more if it had happened before page num you know well i don t want to say this but i have to the blade itself kind of disappointed me not because the book sucks because it doesn t but i had heard so many great things about i
197,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4,i listened to this on audible the narration is superb i m an abercrombie fan that s for sure but i ve read and listened to his work in a strange order so far this is my least favourite book however that s not to say it isn t brilliant just that i much prefer the others i ve read and listened to so far all of which have set a high standard why num stars i d say num num to be honest there were portions of the story up until two thirds the way through that i zoned out on none of which invo
198,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,3,another author in the tradition of glen cook steven erikson there is no good nor evil just people and even the most heinous dark lord had a mother of course the danger in such a book is that you wind up with utterly unlikable characters and no one to root for afterall you may not have liked aragorn but you knew that his side was good it happens that i ve liked most of the characters in erikson s work but i couldn t condone many of their actions it s my numnd gripe with robert jordan 
199,The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,5,let me start by saying that i don t like any of the characters in this book each of them is deeply flawed in some manner and i wouldn t care to spend time with any of them but i found the book very engaging and even though i don t like any of the people i found myself drawn into their lives and the world a very gritty hard world populated with folks that belong there it s less romantic than glen cook s black company series not as much humor either and unapologetic in it s cruelties do
201,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,4,remember back when funny books were funny back before you went to college and found out that dave barry and carl hiaasen weren t funny after all but samuel beckett and charles dickens were hilarious remember when the words on the page didn t just make you smile wryly and shake your head in shame for humanity but actually made you laugh out loud well that s the kind of humor that terry pratchett and neil gaiman s num release good omens brims with and it is so damn good the two british aut
202,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,4,i somehow ended up reading them both simultaneously so i couldn t help wondering what madam bovary might have thought of good omens three days later a package arrived there was no return address but she immediately recognised rodolphe s hand it contained a paperback novel whose title was good omens feverishly she cast herself over it her english was poor but with the aid of a dictionary she persevered and soon made great progress the more she read the greater her bewilderment became 
203,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,3,overall this book was a huge disappointment for me i’d heard so many good things about it and had been meaning to read it for years when i finally started it i was about num pages into it and thought “yes this is going to be one of the most entertaining books i’ve ever read ” it was like reading the hitchhiker’s guide for the first time again it was witty and fast paced and had so many brilliant things to say about society and religion and then about halfway through i realized that i jus

205,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,5,in my personal hierarchy of books this one comes a close second after bulgakov s the master and margarita what can i say like diabolical father like infernal son it may help to understand human affairs to be clear that most of the great triumphs and tragedies of history are caused not by people being fundamentally good or fundamentally bad but by people being fundamentally people in a way i can view this book as my own personal therapy session that is in addition to it being a h

208,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,1,i knew from the first page that this book would not work for me i slogged through about half of it and gave up i lost the thread of the plot long before due to my lack of interest in everything this book is it all felt forced like the themes and ideas were shoved into the narrative and that the plot had to adapt to fit them in it was trying too hard to be funny rather than actually being funny life is far too short for books i don’t enjoy and i could never enjoy this it felt like it was w
209,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,4,“don t think of it as dying said death just think of it as leaving early to avoid the rush ” the apocalypse is not off to a good start ten years ago crowley a demon brought the infant anti christ to a group of satanic nuns who swapped the anti christ with a human child for ten years aziraphale an angel and crowley educate the child on the finer points of good and evil “people couldn t become truly holy he said unless they also had the opportunity to be definitively wicked

212,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,2,i actually feel a little bad giving this num stars since i see so many reviews of people who loved this book unfortunately i m just not one of them i usually like pratchett s work and there are a few comic touches that i liked here but overall the unbelievably slow pace of the latter half of this story nearly drove me bonkers it skips over about num years in a few chapters and then camps out at num hours til doomsday for hundreds of pages the dialogue of the children was tiresome and the o
213,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,5,this has got to be one of the funniest satires i ve ever read i suppose the closest comparison i could make is to describe it as a literary sibling to dogma but filtered through a distinctly british lense that description doesn t really do the story justice but that film definitely hits me in the same place as the book the whole premise and i m not giving much away here begins with the accidental mis placement of the infant antichrist during a complex baby swapping procedure intended t

215,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,2,i read this book before i tried to tackle pratchett on his own merit so i may have to retroactively skew this review based upon what i now know the book is enjoyable but may suffer from the fact that it represents its two authors at what seems to be their most basic states there is no question as to the recognizability of both gaiman s and pratchett s respective styles here but neither seems to add anything to the other one of gaiman s weaknesses is surely his general lack of humor anythin
216,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,1,i can t for the life of me understand the good reviews that this book has received i consider myself a person with a great sense of humour though i found crowley an extremely enjoyable character i could not bring myself to finish this book all of these characters thrown in and abrupt switches of storyline annoyed me and made me refuse to finish it this book tries way too hard to be wacky there is no naturalness to the flow of the humor speaking of which there is no naturalness to the p
217,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,5,no getting around it it is funny clever satire that’s harmlessly irreverent i wasn’t rolling on the floor or anything but i had num i counted laugh out loud moments a few good giggles a smile on my face throughout a great story that moves along very nicely as good and evil as represented by the angel aziraphale the demon crowley join forces to try avert the apocalypse definitely held my interest the interplay between these two was what really made the story liked it
218,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,4,i find if very difficult not to like a book about how plans for armageddon hit a snag when a scatterbrained satanic nun misplaces the antichrist many of the reviews of good omens compare it to douglas adams there are some similarities in that much of the story occurs outside the bounds of normal reality it s genuinely funny and very british but i found the overall tone to be softer less snarky and more intentionally philosophical in nature while the book is very entertaining it also ask
220,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,3,rating the least annoyed three stars i can muster out of five the publisher says according to the nice and accurate prophecies of agnes nutter witch the world s only completely accurate book of prophecies written in num before she exploded the world will end on a saturday next saturday in fact just before dinner so the armies of good and evil are amassing atlantis is rising frogs are falling tempers are flaring everything appears to be going according to divine plan except a some
221,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,5,this novel spoof of the omen is absolutely hilarious from the four bikers of the apocalypse to adorable hell hounds it s my absolute favorite offering from terry pratchett his humor mixed with neil gaiman s is absolute win in my opinion wondering why all my reviews are five stars because i m only reviewing my favorite books not every book i read consider a novel s presence on my goodreads bookshelf as a hearty endorsement i can t believe i just said hearty it sounds like a stew
222,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,5, num/num good omens is a book about the antichrist and the end of the world but don t worry it s not all sad in fact most of it is hilarious the angel aziraphale and the demon crowley are each tasked with finding the antichrist as a baby and swaying him over to their respective sides heaven or hell however through a misunderstanding they lose the antichrist and he grows up to be a normal human boy as a result armageddon goes off with a few hitches it was just as good as i expected
223,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,5,i won t lie i read this because it has a crowley in it and b it s an adult book and i was adulting that was exhausting though please lead me back to the children s aisle that s where i belong i totally enjoyed it though because it s hilarious yeah maybe the story is a bit waffly in places and there are some useless tangents it runs off on but it is downright funny why oh oh keep calm i ll show you first of all it is so like the supernatural tv series what can i say i m a
224,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,1,not very amusing attempt at biblical humor it was a chore i did not finish it getting through num pages before casting it aside it read to me like it had been written by two snarky twenty year olds 
226,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,4,“it has been said that civilization is twenty four hours and two meals away from barbarism ” this was quirky and a little on the odd side but totally fun heaven and hell have basically been in a cold war for well forever it seems ever since lucifer “an angel who did not so much fall as saunter vaguely downwards ” became the bad guy the final show down has been in the works but now finally satan’s son has been born and the prophecies all say that when he is eleven the end of the world wi
227,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,4,oh my god this was one of the funniest books i have ever read the writing was phenomenal and i could see myself and others i know in many of the quirky characters good and evil s earthly representatives discover that the time for the apocalyse has arrived and they re not too happy about it you see they ve grown to like life on earth and besides evil with a capital e itself couldn t possibly do worse things to mankind than what mankind does to itself and the antichrist s name is adam

230,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,5,so funny story i was reading this book re reading really during a recent training session for my job a fairly tedious process the training that is which involves sitting in front of a computer for long hours listening to boring presentations about the software the guy who was sitting next to me was reasonably attractive and rather chatty and he looked over and said what are you reading good omens i said and seeing that he obviously had no idea what it was i added it s abo
231,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,3,i know i know it s blasphemy to not give this book five stars believe me i feel guilty only giving it three stars not because i feel like it deserves more but because i know i should ve liked it more i mean the writing was fantastic and the main characters should ve been interesting enough i don t know maybe i just need to sleep on it but sometimes when i was reading it it felt like the writing was focused more on coming up with a clever punchline than advancing the plot don t get me

236,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,4,after being unimpressed with neverwhere and dismissing it as early gaiman i was delighted to read good omens and find that even though this was written several years before neverwhere it s just as good as gaiman s later works possibly this is due to pratchett s influence at the end of the book there s a nice afterword where the two authors talk about the process of creating the story and who was responsible for writing which parts i ve never read anything by terry pratchett before this an
237,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,1,what a banal poorly paced over padded tedious masturbatory exercise in cleverness like spending several hours sitting next to an un funny comedian oozing smugness out of every pore spouting tired observational humor whilst jabbing you in the ribs every couple of sentences religion amirite bureaucracy amirite traffic amirite nooooooooooooot worrrrrrrrrrrth itttttttttttttt

265,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,1,i know that the majority of my friends on goodreads will stridently disagree with me here but i found good omens evolved or devolved into a rambling unfunny and unconvincing mess i tore through the first num pages and my expectations were high but thereafter at least for me it not only flattened out but sunk completely i like gaiman perhaps the fact that i d read american gods before spoiled good omens as there are strikingly similar elements at play here i found good omens verbo

279,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,4,since moving to london i ve been getting a better grasp on dry and sarcastic english humor along with a taste of the dark and gray winter which wasn t bad at all and the summer which can be glorious when sunny and never overly hot and humid like tokyo and i had never gotten around to terry pratchett and neil gaiman s good omens so it was high time to do so and it was a delightfully written story that skewers every aspect of armageddon the four horsemen of the apocalypse witch hunters

314,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,1,good omens quite frankly needs to be edited halfway through the book i could sum up what had occurred in num pages with a few sentences the book really wanted to be a satire but just wound up being a sort of soggy attempt at poking fun at something totally ripe for poking fun at by only including a smattering of actual revelations content that said the storytelling was maddeningly weak one of the main characters read a book for num pages and then vanished into thin air literally and

335,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,4,good omens is one of those books that’s so iconic it’s hard to review because i’m not sure what’s left to be said it’s wryly witty in exactly the way you would expect from terry pratchett and neil gaiman with a sprinkling of pratchett brand social satire and gaiman variety dark weirdness there’s also a strong undertone of affection for humanity as a whole that i loved it’s a book about the apocalypse but it’s also a book about how amazing and fascinating people are at their best and at th

340,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,5,i fell in love with good omens all over again more than num years after my first reading of it it s essentially a long form joke the entire plot playing with established notions of biblical apocalypse narratives by far my favourite sections all involved crowley and aziraphale the unlikely friendship between an angel and his fallen comrade and their mutual affection for the mortal inhabitants of earth was such a delight to rediscover their banter and struggles to understand the human world w
341,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,3,good omens is a zany take on the end of the world as well all know it the anti christ is born but due to a mix up of babies due largely in part to the ineptitude of the angel and demon in charge of armageddon who rather fancy the world as it is things go a bit askew and comedy ensues most everyone has read this but me so i’m not going to go all long windy with the plot synopsis i listened to this on audio and though the narrator does a spiffy job it took me a quite a bit of time to get in

343,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,5,the first time i read this book was during undergrad i would pull it out just before class to surreptitiously read a few pages before a lecture which of course would make me burst into laughter and turn a few heads and people would ask what i was reading well one day a student i had been chatting with sat down next to me and said so i read that book you were laughing about and i don t understand what was so funny i came to realise i have two criteria as a baseline for whether or not i l
345,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,5,this book is the result of a collaboration between neil gaiman and terry pratchett what more needs to be said put these two together and have them write a book about some lighthearted theme like armageddon and the end of the world and guaranteed to have a real gut buster of a novel 
346,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,5,the first time i ve read this one i loved it and i loved it more this second time and this book is why i have a complicated relationship with gaiman i love pratchett and when i first read this book it was my first time with gaiman so i always expect something similar to this book when i read a gaiman s book i really loved crowley and azraphel they are really great and adam too and then there is death and obviously i love him and the footnotes are fantastic as always

354,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,4,like num num honestly i don t even know what was happening half the time but i still loved this
355,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,3,this was a good book very well written and the story was super super interesting i’m just not the type of person who is into reading a bunch of different povs its tough to keep up with who’s who when you have to read over an extended period of time i still really enjoyed the story though 
356,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,5,i honestly don’t know what to say about this book it is funny witty well written and just plain entertaining the story itself takes place over num hectic days with a brief look at num years before in which the apocalypse occurs it follows many characters from the antichrist to the characters war famine pollution and death and how they play a role in the end of the world i highly recommend it to everyone it really is a lighter funnier read than the premise suggests 
357,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,5,i loved this it’s so funny some of the jokes were really obscure and weird and the some scenes are just iconic like crowley driving a car that doesn’t even look like a car anymore because it’s been on fire for a while 
359,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,3,a fun trip to the apocalypse beyond english humor which doesn t usually do too much for me but this was pretty good i d have liked it better if it had been shorter by half though 
360,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,5,i m normally not a neil gaiman fan his stories don t do much for me for some reason the only book of terry pratchett i ve read is the color of magic and i don t remember much about it other than not really caring for it however the two together are delightful i really loved good omens the nice and accurate prophecies of agnes nutter witch start to finish good omens does some of my favorite things it s fantastical whimsical very british loaded with dry humor all in addition to a grea
361,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,3,i will admit regretfully that the hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy seemed to have lost something when i started reading it again as an adult but the majority of this book s fans are not children it makes me more than a little concerned about the state of british humour possibly it is the plot which turned people on nevertheless this is probably the book which has simultaneously confirmed that i won t be reading more pratchett nor will i start reading gaiman put simply despite num or
362,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,4,num num stars what can i say about good omens that hasn t been said yet it s not for everyone nothing wrong there but if you like crazy fun colorful imagery well there s a big chance this book is for you i heard about neil gaiman and this book from a good friend of mine years ago probably over a decade ago when we first met it took me this long to read it but i wasn t in a hurry i knew i would love it i m the weird kind of person who doesn t like audio books because my imagination provi
363,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,5,as woud be expected from a writing partnership involving terry pratchett and neil gaiman this is a quietly humorous book about the coming of the apocalypse crowley a fallen angel from hell is entrusted with delivering the infant antichrist to a maternity hospital where he is to be swapped with a human child and brought up by satanic tutors until the age of num when he is expected to start the apocalypse unfortuntely a careless nun swaps the wrong baby and the antichrist ends up being rasied
364,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,5,two geniuses putting their heads together and creating one of the most hilarious original and enjoyable reads i have ever come across pratchett and gaiman s writing styles are well suited to each other and combine to create something with it s own style i love that there are lines in the book that neither neil nor terry remember writing truly the book has a mind of its own never has the apocalypse been more funny or more relatable what s more the collaboration of an angel and a demon t
366,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,5,what a funny funny book this is it s thought provoking too if i were a die hard millennialist i probably would have been extremely offended i might have even tossed this book but i m a lutheran we have a sense of humor about religion and can tell the difference between satire and bashing i also grew up in the era of the omen rosemary s baby and the exorcist many of the jokes requires a knowledge of these books/movies to make any sense it also helps if you ve actually read the l
367,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,4,this book has the tone and plot of a neil gaiman but the humor in it felt a bit more like terry pratchett if you have never read either of these authors i will spell it out for you this is a pretty amazing combination i really enjoyed this book but my favorite thing about it was the subject matter gaiman is skilled at pushing boundaries and making me view the world in a slightly different way overall point of this review read this book even if you are not usually a fan of fantasy or ha
369,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,4, it was a perfectly normal gerbil it appeared to be living in an exciting construction of cylinders spheres and treadmills such as the spanish inquisition would have devised if they d had access to a plastics molding press many people meeting aziraphale for the first time formed three impressions that he was english that he was intelligent and that he was gayer than a tree full of monkeys on nitrous oxide 
370,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,5,oh my lord commander it was hilarious my cheeks still hurting me for all the laughs no kidding if you feel depressed or your boy/girlfriend broke up with you i don t know about this but some people say is sad make sure you bought this one it s like anansi boys for put an example you can t read them without a stupid smile on your face 
371,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,4,num num stars aha my only complaint is that the authors try a little too hard to be witty at times which on the flip side is just me attempting to pick something to nag at in order to prevent myself from praising this book to high heavens it s just enjoyable the most perfect beach read that exists in my opinion if one is fond of finding out how the world ends while sunbathing 
372,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,3,i read this a few years ago and absolutely loved it unfortunately this time i used the audio which i was not a fan of it was like i missed num of the humor and this book is all about the humor next time i will read the print copy

374,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,4,this was such an enjoyable read i honestly laughed out loud at times the wittiness of good omens is on a par with douglas adams wit so if you liked the hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy i think you ll enjoy this i don t normally write in books but i was seriously tempted to highlight lines in this book all of it probably would have been highlighted though it s that good the dynamic partnership of pratchett and gaiman worked really well because it was hard to tell who wrote what although 
376,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,5,this book is pure mirth and magic the apocalypse looms over this comedic tale and in it s way stands an angel and demon who are pals the antichrist who was switched at birth and therefore raised to be a nice normal human boy the descendant of a witch a couple witch hunters and the anarchists childhood chums boy does this book play things fast and loose it s almost always smileworthy and occasionally chuckle worthy and insanely optimistic it is consistently comedic but doesn t lose its plo

383,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,5,for lovers of modern fantasy there are two names that are on most people s must read lists terry pratchett and neil gaiman at first glance there doesn t seem to be much in common with this pair terry pratchett writes the world renowned discworld series a fantasy epic set on a flat world which is supported by four elephants who in turn are standing on a great turtle which swims through the emptiness of space what started as a parody of the sword and sandals genre of fantasy discworld h
385,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,5, that s how it goes you think you re on top of the world and suddenly they spring armageddon on you this book has been a favorite of mine for years to say it with clive barker s words on the cover the apocalypse has never been funnier this is the story of a hodge podge of very different characters running around trying to either stop the end of the world as we know it or to make it happen you see it s all part of the big plan but is it also the ineffable plan and technically it sho
386,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,3,i really wished i liked this book as much as other people i wish i found it uproariously funny as i recently heard it called don t get me wrong i don t hate the book far from it but it s just not my one of my faves from either contributor and there was one thing i noticed in rereading it that i m not entirely sure i picked up on the first time none of the characters aside from the them are really necessary for the climax all this time and energy is spent on these characters and th

390,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,5,i ve always loved good omens it s irreverent and wise cracking without getting annoying even when it s irreverent about things that are or were important to me it s not laughing at people who believe in christianity despite the potential there and it s not scrapping the whole religion either nor is it completely condemning the other side the demons aziraphale and crowley balance each other out nicely and balance the portrayal of both sides the audiobook version is really good it s re

393,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,5,i heard a lot of hype before reading this book so i was mildly disappointed when it wasn t the best thing i d ever read that being said it was still a great book based on a hysterical premise good quote from the book there are some dogs which when you meet them remind you that despite thousands of years of manmade evolution every dog is still only two meals away from being a wolf update i recently listened to good omens the bbc radio num dramitisation and it was excellent in every way 
394,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,5,it took me quite a while to finish good omens but through no faults of the book itself i just couldn t bring myself to read it when i wasn t well enough and in the right mood but the book is easy to read it s funny and it has these quotes that you feel like throwing to your best friends who by now hate you because they read the book already a thousand times the story is about adam the anti christ an num year old kid that grew up to be a normal human and he has to get involved into the whole

397,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,5,neil gaiman and terry pratchett are pretty kick ass as individuals when they get together though holy crap i ve read this book five or six times over the years and it always makes my face hurt from laughing so hard it s even better if you ve read the bible especially the book of revelations here s an example what if the antichrist was switched at birth with a normal human kid and grew up in a normal british middle class family the four horsemen of the apocalypse become the four motorcy

402,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,4, num num i love this book it s funny smart witty overall it s just a big joke on the apocalypse and nothing literally nothing is taken seriously the only thing that bothered me was the last third of the book i mean it s the end of the world you can t take it this slowly 
403,"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch",Terry Pratchett,4,pratchett and gaiman what a duo it has a disc world feel but based in modern day england where the end of mankind is nigh there s a lot of quirky characters many silly storylines but a lot of sensible warnings about where we are heading

509,The Name of the Wind,Patrick Rothfuss,5,i rate this book num stars out of num it s that amazing i believe that no matter how long i think about what i want to say about this book i will probably not find the right words to describe how interesting and well written this book is not just because words and more specifically names are of great importance in the universe created in this book the plot was impeccable and the character building in this book is so good that one can distinguish the different characters from each other with eas
510,The Name of the Wind,Patrick Rothfuss,5,num num stars i read few fantasy books so i wouldn t call myself expert on this field i usually stick to the ya and dystopia but this book changed everything for me i wouldn t be surprised if brandon sanderson robin hobb or jim butcher somehow find themselves on my shelf i enjoyed this book very much and i am planning to read sequel as well but not now i heard the second book was better than the first one but now i don t have time to read it when i saw it has num pages i decided it would

512,The Name of the Wind,Patrick Rothfuss,5,num num stars well that was an epic book perhaps not the smartest book to listen to on audio just because it was mammoth and it took me a good few weeks to listen to it with a bit of solid listening every day i love a good fantasy book and rothfuss has written the first of what is already an extremely popular trilogy or eventual trilogy as only the first num books and a novella have been released so far and the next one is over a year away according to goodreads there is no way to sum this bo

515,The Name of the Wind,Patrick Rothfuss,5,overall i loved this book there were parts that i found utterly transcendent…like the part where kvothe picks up and plays the lute of another musician he is travelling with on the way to the university there were a few scenes in the book like this one which were for me so able to communicate the moment perfectly to put the reader into the very skin of the story s character i find that if a book has one such scene that is quite something to have more than one makes this book truly stand

519,The Name of the Wind,Patrick Rothfuss,5,this is brilliant heady stuff at least if you re an author i think i would give up one of my children for the chance to write something like this a big sprawling chronicle of someone s life it s all there the mundane details of eating and getting dressed and worrying about having enough money along with grander things like magic and dragonslaying and falling in love with a mercurial beauty kvothe s story is like nothing else and i just drank it all in it s so real the real story of

542,The Name of the Wind,Patrick Rothfuss,5,i think that patrick rothfuss is one of the best actual storytellers he immerses you in the life of kvothe with impressive skill in general i like to read the book although i must say that sometimes i missed more rhythm on some parts sometimes i had the feeling that the descriptions had a bigger role compared with the actions slowing down the narrative motor of the novel i think that the characters are well drawn but for my taste sometimes the main character suffers from too much perfect
544,The Name of the Wind,Patrick Rothfuss,5,my rating num/num the name of the wind by patrick rothfuss is the first novel in the king killer chronicles following the life story of kvothe the story is told in three days the first day is this book by kvothe to the chronicler the present day parts are told in third person perspective by kvothe bast or the chronicler while the life of kvothe is narrated by kvothe himself this book is fantastic it actually started pretty slow and weird in a way but then it started to get interesting patri
545,The Name of the Wind,Patrick Rothfuss,4,it isn t that there is anything particularly new here but it s done so well that that doesn t matter it is after all not so much about what it s about as how it is about it i know that may sound strange coming from me given that i ve spent so much time bemoaning lazily used fantasy tropes the last couple of months the keyword there though is lazily so while this is not revolutionary in terms of epic fantasy it is damned well told and thoroughly engrossing note the rest of this revi

561,The Name of the Wind,Patrick Rothfuss,2,update i ve realised that my issues with this series have been magnified by the very high rating on gr if it had a more normal rating i think my review would have said something like awesome story although the lack of an ending was annoying instead i ve felt an obsessive need to understand why everyone gave num stars and found myself getting more an more frustrated about it the popularity of this book is what ruined it for me it s a pity but now that i ve realised it i won t let it happen
563,The Name of the Wind,Patrick Rothfuss,5,[num stars] i ve finally finished this and i have to say i loved it and for that alone this book deserves num stars i don t however think this is a perfect book it has its flaws and it didn t blow me away quite as much as some other books but regardless i was captivated by kvothe s storytelling if you re curious i think my main issues come from weird pacing and kvothe s overall unlikeable character 
564,The Name of the Wind,Patrick Rothfuss,1,people say this book deconstructs a bunch of fantasy tropes which tropes exactly are we deconstructing here all i see is the mother father of all gary stu characters and a bunch of oh i m so original but not so original that i ll dispense with horses and inns and a sexist society fantasy filler the parts of fantasy that really need to be deconstructed are still here in all their glory complete and utter wish fulfillment at its absolute worst 
565,The Name of the Wind,Patrick Rothfuss,4,wow that took a minute to get through at just over num pages it s a brick of a book and those tend to be intimidating for me not only because of the time it will take to get through and the many other books i won t be reading because i will be reading the tome instead but in this particular case it is the first book in a trilogy all of the books equally as thick and tackling a book like that takes some commitment the name of the wind has been sitting on my shelves for a very long time

568,The Name of the Wind,Patrick Rothfuss,5,let me start off by saying to all those who have read the book what was that ending okay sorry backing up to the beginning i picked up this book on a whim as i had heard it mentioned a fair amount when it came to an adult fantasy series i wasn t sure what was going to happen going into this book or if i would like it holy hell i loved this book i ve barley touched adult fantasy as the books usually are giant but this was so so worth the read don t let the long time i took reading this

572,The Name of the Wind,Patrick Rothfuss,4,english | español this book was awesome for the most part it reads as a wonderful coming of age story of a man who is bound to become a hero even though this first book covered most of his early steps and nothing big happened in my opinion except for a couple of incidents so why did i rate it so high if nothing important happened because of the beautiful prose of rothfuss i fell in love with his writing style and the wonderful world he created it felt as classical tolkien like fantasy

575,The Name of the Wind,Patrick Rothfuss,5,this is the first fantasy novel i ve read since the lord of the rings that could arguably be classified as literary fiction as well as fantasy a lot of fantasy novels are rightly famous for their world building but the genre is not renowned for its sophisticated style or character development the name of the wind is most emphatically the exception to that rule rothfuss s narrative style is so exquisite that it often borders on the poetic without ever descending into cliche or cheesiness

580,The Name of the Wind,Patrick Rothfuss,1,reading this book is like watching someone jerk off and pat themselves on the back for it at the same time the main character is so completely filled with disgusting arrogance and vomit inducing perfection that it over flows into the surrounding prose after awhile you re left with the distinct impression that through the smug tone and over blown sense of self worth littering every page you re learning more about the author than the character many other reviews have mentioned the perfection of
581,The Name of the Wind,Patrick Rothfuss,4,this is not my normal genre it is the first fantasy novel i have read for years but my husband loved it after i bought it for him so i decided to give it a go the first thing that drew me in was the poetic prose this is one short example ‘the music moved like a spiderweb stirred by a gentle breeze ’ but there were plenty of other examples i could have used also it felt like this was not quite the normal good versus evil lord of the rings type spin off of some fantasies it is more about th

586,The Name of the Wind,Patrick Rothfuss,3,phew that was long this is my second attempt at reading this and this time i managed to get past chapter num turned out to be a fairly fast read reasonably enjoyable i occasionally wanted to thwack kvothe when he couldn t restrain his mouth every time he was near ambrose who can be charitably described as a jerk the women in the stories are pretty flat characters and i found it really hard to care about them as people not a good sign kvothe s general brilliance at times felt a little

590,The Name of the Wind,Patrick Rothfuss,5,this was my first excursion into this genre for quite some time i’ve read the song of ice and fire series but have never really considered myself a fantasy reader this book has changed that and made me want to read more fantastical stories although i fear that nothing will live up to it this book has a great structure to it and it is well set within the oral storytelling tradition the legendary magician kwothe our main character is in hiding and has been persuaded to tell his tale the

594,The Name of the Wind,Patrick Rothfuss,5,several days have passed since i finished this book and i still don’t really know what i want to say about it in paperback form it is num pages long and action wise nothing very much happens the initial conflicting trigger is not resolved no questions are truly answered and yet i feel i can give this book no less than five stars i almost gave up on it at around num pages but something about the writing style kept me reading beyond that point it reeled me in more and more with every page
595,The Name of the Wind,Patrick Rothfuss,4,well it s a type of fantasy that i havn t encountered before normally i am used to read epic fantasy with lots of actions bloodshed and adventures this certainly does nt fall into them it is a story about a hero who recalls his life events his miseries his love affections and his credits it s like a long detailed biography the world building is certainly strong and it does make the world smooth and detailed and likable it also has a touch of realness in it the magic system is sooo
596,The Name of the Wind,Patrick Rothfuss,4,not a bad book but i wasn t fully engaged until very late in it kvothe as a character is well written and the author makes it easy to believe in this man who can so unbelievably brilliant at some times but so utterly foolish at others still the fact that he was all over the place made it very hard for me to relate to or like him and that impeded my enjoyment of the story somewhat especially since much of the book is about his early life when what i really wanted to get into was the main co

601,The Name of the Wind,Patrick Rothfuss,5,originally posted at fantasy literature you know how sometimes a book or a movie or a concert gets so hyped up in the press and you have such high expectations that when you finally get around to reading/seeing it it disappoints that s what i was worried might happen when i decided to read the name of the wind i purposely came to it late hoping to wait until patrick rothfuss was nearly finished with the trilogy before i starting it but the book has received so much attention that it beca
602,The Name of the Wind,Patrick Rothfuss,5,“words are pale shadows of forgotten names as names have power words have power words can light fires in the minds of men words can wring tears from the hardest hearts ” often i’m at a loss for words when i need them most why is it so difficult to express how much you love something i cannot even begin to describe how epically amazing this book is ‘epic’ and ‘amazing’ don’t even begin the cover it i cannot tell you how much i love this book but i will try if narrations can pierce hear
605,The Odyssey,Homer,4,so my first “non school related experience with homer’s classic tale and my most powerful impression beyond the overall splendor of the story was holy shit snacks these greeks were a violent bunch case in point they hauled him out through the doorway into the court lopped his nose and ears with a ruthless knife tore his genitals out for the dogs to eat raw and in manic fury hacked off hands and feet then once they’d washed their own hands and feet they went inside again to join ody

607,The Odyssey,Homer,5,i have read the odyssey three times the first was not really a read but more of a listen in the true oral tradition during embroidery class one of us young girls on the verge of entering the teens would read a passage while the rest were all busy with our eyes and fingers our needles and threads all learning to be future penelopes crafty with their crafts cultivated patient and loyal and all wives the second read was already as an adult that time i let myself be led by the adventures
608,The Odyssey,Homer,5,ever since i first read homer’s epic describing the adventures of odysseus back in my school days three of those adventures fired my imagination the lotus eaters the cyclops and the sirens most especially the sirens i just did revisit these sections of this greek epic and my imagination was set aflame yet again how much you ask here is my microfiction as a tribute to the great poet the sirens this happened back in those days when i was a member of an experimental performing arts troupe d

610,The Odyssey,Homer,5,it s impossible not to smile when you start reading such a classic and after only the first few pages you realize and completely understand why it s regarded as one of the most important works in literature i m always a little anxious when i tackle such important and renowned books for being afraid of not comprehending or loving them war and peace and don quixote for example as they seem to deserve not that i m obligated to like them but i always feel such buzz comes for a reason and i
611,The Odyssey,Homer,5, i’m not normally a praying man but if you’re up there please save me superman —homer simpson following james joyce’s lead i used homer’s heroic story as inspiration and research for a novel in progress but how can i a mere mortal do justice to the most famous epic poem ever written an encounter with a work of this magnitude should be shared rather than reviewed homer is the great great great recurring grand daddy of modern literature and this colossus is as immortal as the gods
612,The Odyssey,Homer,5,the first line in emily wilson’s new translation of the odyssey the first by a woman scholar is “tell me about a complicated man ” in an article by wyatt mason in the nyt late last year wilson tells us “i could’ve said ‘tell me about a straying husband ’ and that’s a viable translation that’s one of the things [the original language] says…[but] i want to be super responsible about my relationship to the greek text i want to be saying after multiple different revisions this is the best i

616,The Odyssey,Homer,5,i started this as i was told it is essential reading if i ever want to give a shot at reading ulysses i was a bit apprehensive and spent a long time deciding on which translation to choose finally it was stephen s review that convinced me to go for the robert fagles version i have no way of judging how good a decision that was this translation by robert fagles is of the greek text edited by david monro and thomas allen first published in num by the oxford university press this two volum
617,The Odyssey,Homer,4,book review num out of num stars to the odyssey published around num bc and written by homer i was tasked with reading this epic work as part of an advanced placement english course in between my junior and senior years of high school i loved literature back then as much as i do now and my reading habits probably grew from everything my teachers encouraged us to read during the summer hiatus and mid year breaks we sampled literature from all over the world and this greek tome was one of the
619,The Odyssey,Homer,5,quite possibly one of my favourite books it was this novel that ignited my love for greek and roman mythology and antiquity leading me to choose a degree in classical civilisations i always look back on the odyssey with fondness i love all the monsters he faces and the gods who involve themselves with odysseus trials as he makes his way home after the trojan war love love love 
620,The Odyssey,Homer,5,to this day the most interesting research project that i’ve ever done was the very first it was on the homeric question i was a sophomore in college—a student with unfortunate literary ambitions who had just decided to major in anthropology by this point i had at least tacitly decided that i wanted to be a professor in my future lay the vast and unexplored ocean of academia what was the safest vessel to travel into that forbidden wine dark sea research i signed up for a reading project
622,The Odyssey,Homer,5,where do you start with a book such as this an epic tale that has been around for almost three thousand years i have no idea what i do know is that i read it and loved it i had little foreknowledge of the story and i haven t looked into the meanings or history too deeply instead i ve tried to appreciate the story on it s own merits getting swept away like odysseus on the sea there were quiet contemplative events and dramatic battles personal struggles and wider societal issues gods and
623,The Odyssey,Homer,5,my parents split when i was very young the arrangement they made between them was that my brother and i would spend the weekends with our father but would live during the week with my mother one winter when i was ten years old it started to snow heavily and gave no indication of stopping any time soon it was a sunday morning and my brother and i were due to leave dad’s and return to what for us was home the snow however had other ideas to go home we had to catch two buses the first
624,The Odyssey,Homer,4,odysseus is the ultimate anti hero and that s probably why as much as he annoys me at times with his antics i ll always prefer him to achilles sure one can t deny how unreliable and prejudiced he is as a narrator just look at how he twists the reality when describing the cyclops life and culture but that s precisely in addition to the engaging structure what makes the odyssey so readable and less old felt than the iliad well assuming you re reading a translation in verses o
625,The Odyssey,Homer,5,i first read extracts of the odyssey in junior high and high school and some years later purchased the highly acclaimed fitzgerald translation it is a masterpiece that brings out the strengths of this iconic story of the voyage of ulysses from the fall of troy back to his native ithaca and his beloved and besieged penelope the story is highly readable and full of adventure and misadventure monsters and heroes and ultimately a triumphant voyage home yes it is very masculine in perspective so
626,The Odyssey,Homer,4,it s funny how many people feel intimidated by this book sure it s thousands of years old and certainly greek culture has some peculiarities but the book is remarkably sometimes surprisingly modern and most translations show the straightforward simplicity of the story perhaps like the seventh seal the odyssey has gotten a reputation for being difficult because it has been embraced by intellectuals and worse wanna be intellectuals but like bergman s classic film the odyssey is focused o
627,The Odyssey,Homer,5,i shelved this as classic newly read only because i don t think i ever read a full version in verse parts in prose and b movies starring either kirk douglas or anthony quinn or charlton heston as the toga clad avenger like butter this translation of fagles loved how smooth it read and the repeating tropes modifying various nouns sparkling eyed athena bright eyed goddess dawn with her rose red fingers wine dark sea odysseus master of craft etc what threw me was how fast t
630,The Odyssey,Homer,5,last year i read homer s the iliad and loved the storyline but i was left with a sense that there was something missing from my reading experience at times the iliad bored me with its clunky writing style and at the time i concluded that this was down to the translation that read so this year i decided to read two versions of homer s classic epic poem the odyssey simultaneously to decide if i would have a different reaction to the different translations of the same texts and i num did i ch
632,The Odyssey,Homer,5,after having read and enjoyed fagles translation not too long ago i decided to join with a group reading a new translation by emily wilson the first woman to take on this task in english this has proved to be an excellent decision while i have always had respect for those who translate literature i now realize even more fully how seemingly small insignificant details can radically alter one’s perception of a classic or at least cause you to reconsider long held beliefs about characters or

639,The Odyssey,Homer,5,the odyssey is well the odyssey beyond being a tremendously exciting read it is a foundational work in western literature it is a glorious story of love and war gods and humans adventure in and around the mediterranean and some argue out to the west indies on the surface simply the story of odysseus s adventures after the fall of troy it is a rich tapestry of places characters and creatures which have entered into the basic language of western literature for academic study of the
640,The Odyssey,Homer,4,like a bolt of lightning striking a tree the iliad of homer set my cranium alight when its sheer incantatory power first washed over me it s an astonishing work brutal and violent while at the same time deeply affecting brimming with incisive insights into human nature odysseus and crew having taken precautions to not be lured by the sirens song sail past them homer s subsequent epic poem i was less enraptured by because of its lack of focus even though it is unquestionable that it re

644,The Odyssey,Homer,4,i first read the odyssey when i was a freshman in high school i think it might actually have been the very first assigned reading that year and i remember being excited for it and liking the story but having suuuuuch a hard time getting through it because the translation i was reading was so dense looking back and now having read this translation i don t actually think i liked it as much as i thought i did and i have some definite opinions about the greeks being huge jerks mostly that t

647,The Odyssey,Homer,5,reading understanding and analyzing the odyssey is a milestone in any person s life it is colossal not only in length but also in reputation there are few books as referenced or lauded as homer s two epics and yet each one delivers what makes reading the iliad and the odyssey in succession so satisfying is that they are unique in their tone characters story and history i think what the iliad lacks in action and adventure it makes up for with complex characterization the odyssey is f

649,The Odyssey,Homer,5,my knowledge of classical literature and mythology is sadly lacking the main reason i decided to tackle the odyssey is because i want to read ulysses and i gather that a passing acquaintance with this work will make that experience more meaningful listening to ian mckellen reading the robert fagles translation made me regret my lack of education in the classics i have no way of assessing the merits of fagles work but i would love be to be able to read this epic poem in the language in whic

651,The Odyssey,Homer,4,this is a marvelous poem everyone knows that it has survived centuries milennia now thanks to robert fagles s brilliant and vivid translation no reader should ever feel overwhelmed or literarily word excluded by the odyssey while reading it i learned that a greek men weep constantly b greek hospitality is awesome and one receives many presents c odysseus and penelope s son telemachus is pretty constantly an ass to his mother as the story winds down and odysseus returns to penel
652,The Odyssey,Homer,5,an excellent translation in terms of poetic verve and narrative dynamism i don t have greek so can t say anything about faithfulness to the original but it s a toss up between this and the fagles which i read alongside it and with which i found a lot of consanguinity or conviviality or something i think i d give a slight edge to wilson s but really you d enjoy either translation far superior to the penguin one i read in my class on joyce s ulysses back in uni it was by rieu sp i bel
653,The Odyssey,Homer,4,note that in what follows all book and line references are to the fagles translation in the classic star trek episode “errand of mercy” there is a scene toward the end that my readings of the iliad and the odyssey brought to mind and prompted the comment made in the comments earlier i e “the klingons are ancient greeks ” the organians have revealed themselves to be super evolved incorporeal beings and have put a stop to the “insane war ” as ayelborne calls it the klingons and the federation

656,The Odyssey,Homer,4,the version that i read was the robert fagles translation and i liked the simplicity and the music of the language it was like a fantasy story told in the lyrics of a song i enjoyed both the verse like form and the roller coaster narrative some episodes of which incidentally called to mind similar scenes in the chinese classical novel journey to the west for example the episode about nymph calypso keeping odysseus a captive is very similar to the scene where a lair of seductive spider spir
657,The Odyssey,Homer,5,lately the wandering of my reading has taken me home to homer once again i began by reading “song of achilles” by madeline miller a novel which i can’t recommend more highly and from there to “the iliad” in a translation by robert graves then i moved onto “the odyssey” and this time read from the lattimore translation after having previously studied at length the fitzgerald translation homer proves that the test of time is a valid one that is there is a reason that the writing has endur
658,The Odyssey,Homer,4,i can see that this is a classic epic worthy of its reputation but still i am disappointed in the character of odysseus many say odysseus is the first modern man but i cannot get it i admit that he is pragmatic cunning deceptive complicated he endures humiliation and fights for survival for homecoming he rejects immortality for mortality but are these characteristics sufficient to count him as modern i only see him as different and not in a good way for example odysseus is just
659,The Odyssey,Homer,4,the four stars are for the translation obviously she is a little too brisk for me and some of her modernising jars a little i also do not agree with some of her interpretations though i do like her emphasis on the “slave” rather than for example “maid” or similar really what always surprises me every time i read this text is how little of it is actually taken up with the big hits the sirens etc and how clearly it is really much more concerned with homecoming and the whole thing bei

661,The Odyssey,Homer,4,many years ago i tried many times to read this seemingly formidable greek epic paperback not this copy published by penguin translated by professor e v rieu but in vain that is i could focus on a few chapters and left it at that probably i didn’t have the right motive i guessed then i even thought i wouldn’t ever finish reading this fine remarkable translation in english not in the original at all therefore since the middle of last may i’ve decided to read this handsome hardcover cha
662,The Odyssey,Homer,5,the odyssey needs no review it is an important piece of literature not only for its own right but because it has provided so much reference material for subsequent great works i had not read it since my college days too many years to count so it was both interesting and worthwhile to visit it again as the godlike and resourceful odysseus might say the journey was worth it 
663,The Odyssey,Homer,5,the odyssey is a book that in many ways must be read in conjuncture with homer s the iliad like that other work of poetry it is an epic tale of fantasy with great truths for humanity as it stands today the iliad is generally considered to be the earlier of the two works if you accept that homer was a single individual due to the fact that this the odyssey contains a story which begins after the events of the iliad however where the iliad is a story of conflict and tragedy full of patho

670,The Odyssey,Homer,4,the odyssey by homer trans emily wilson is the first published translation by a woman of homer’s odyssey as with any translation the translator has an infinite number of choices to make in terms of diction emphasis ambiguities in the language meter etc wilson’s choices make for a unified and consistent approach drawing attention to subtleties and nuances in the work that had previously been overlooked her translation invites a new reading of the odyssey wilson makes some interesting c
671,The Odyssey,Homer,3,felt natural to follow up the iliad with the odyssey i did not enjoy it nearly as much homer s pattern of repetition is more prevalent in this work what i found astounding is that although i had never read this work i knew the plot it seems portions of odesseus travails are told in high school and college courses in song cream in children s books this story emphasized the cunning discussed in the iliad o lived from his wits and the gifts from the gods i was never so happy as when he
672,The Odyssey,Homer,5,although the odyssey can t be understood without the iliad in my humble opinion i think these are two entirely different books the iliad is a denser almost historic reading more focused on events than in characters whereas the odyssey is built from a more modern structure in which there s a main character ulysses with a strong goal to get home the odyssey is an ideal choice for all adventure and mythology fans and a must read for all those aspiring to become a writer because it s proba

678,The Odyssey,Homer,3,i read this fist of course i suppose i should say back in my school days i must say i enjoyed the iliad more hey i was young and got into the battles yeah i was a bit shallow still as an adventure story this reads very well if you haven t read it you might consider it after all it s been around since about num bc pretty good track record this is one of the worlds great epic poems/stories don t miss it 
679,The Odyssey,Homer,3,richmond lattimore’s translation wasn’t terribly hard to read and i enjoyed reading the story of odysseus overall the odyssey wasn’t fantastic but it wasn’t horrible either it did take me a while to get through though because odysseus and his ego kept getting on my nerves num num

682,The Odyssey,Homer,2,i read the amazonclassics edition this is very likely going to be the most unhelpful review ever but i m still just so confused over what i read in the odyssey that i don t really know how to explain what it s about my edition did have a paragraph at the top of each chapter which tried to summarise what was going on with the various characters but even with that this wasn t an easy edition of a much interested classic to read i may return to this book in the future but not with a kindle edi
684,The Odyssey,Homer,5,right then as with the iliad i m not going to write a proper review this is just going to be a small ramble of my thoughts which lets be honest here most of my reviews are anyway i think classics are difficult to review at the best of times but this one being so ancient makes it all the more harder i read this in the same fashion that i read the iliad that is i both listened to the audiobook and read the physical book in places dan stevens narration was fantastic and i d recommend it t
685,The Odyssey,Homer,4,this is such a classic adventure story and there are so many modern references to it that it kind of suggests how important this story has become it was many years ago that i first read it and there s plenty i ve forgotten but there s so much to it that you can kind of read random chunks at a time for individual stories among the overarching saga the mythology is brilliant and i definitely want to re read this one the language is quite a struggle though so don t go into it half hearted or

703,The Odyssey,Homer,5,i drag my feet on reading the classics because i think i m going to be bored but to my surprise i found i enjoyed the odyssey tremendously it did not read like an epic poem in any classical rhythmic metered way that would eventually put me to sleep it read like a favorite story that had finally been written down after being told for generations it was easy to absorb but it would have to be because people remembered it liked hearing it and liked repeating it and that s why it has survived
704,The Odyssey,Homer,5,after reading the iliad for the first time it only made sense to read this book i ve read this book a few times before but it was fun picking things up i didn t before this is also the first time i picked up this book after reading jame joyce s ulysses a few years ago i liked comparing the two books i know there are several different takes on this book but joyce still stands out for me compared to the others plus i loved the ending to joyce s book over homer homer doesn t give you the

707,The Odyssey,Homer,5, his lies were like the truth the five stars are for the lovely rhythmic english in emily wilson s fluent translation i read it twice once for the content and again for the poetry it s all about style hers is simple on the surface a clear window that reveals the multiple layers of meaning in the text starting with line one tell me about a complicated man complicated is a simple word in itself but warns the reader that odysseus will not be one dimensional like paul bunyan odysse
708,The Odyssey,Homer,5,“when gods spin threads of pain even great kings are made to wander far and suffer greatly ” the first time i read the odyssey i read the fitzgerald translation in a college english class with a wonderful teacher who helped us along with backstory and her excitement for the text i loved it this time i was similarly helped by fellow readers teachers and scholars in the group read of emily wilson’s new translation https //www goodreads com/group/show/ i learned so much from them and from
709,The Odyssey,Homer,5,in both high school and college my exposure to the odyssey was limited to a couple of chapters or sequences hand picked by the instructor as a kind of overview of the epic what i learned about the odyssey was that it was about gods and monsters and it involved a lot of convoluted completely irrelevant details mainly it just seemed like some primitive narrative instructors were plowing through before moving on to the good stuff i only picked it up now because i read an article about emily wil
710,The Odyssey,Homer,5,a wonderful and enchanting masterpiece by homer that fascinates you from the opening pages reading it immediately after the ‘iliad” was very important in order to understand the main story key heroes and the background context of the work as it is basically about the homeward journey nostos of odysseus after the sacking of ilium reading this great work in adulthood allows you to understand its deep layers of meaning and thus enjoy its beauty even more the epic addresses different themes
711,The Odyssey,Homer,4,a riveting adventure summed up as a series of unfortunate events multiplied tenfold and blew it into epic proportions i have to admit that this is the first time i ve read homer s odyssey and i liked it my heart goes to poor odysseus who after surviving the ten year trojan war has to circumnavigate the odds and begin a ten year voyage back home to his grieving family in ithaca his voyage home was never easy teemed with trials and tribulations he traveled to the underworld encountered hid
712,The Odyssey,Homer,5,after reading the iliad a couple years back my hopes for enjoying homer were not high the battles and genealogies of the iliad were interesting but it felt more like reading history than fiction it turned out my fears that the odyssey would be the same were unfounded the odyssey and its hero odysseus quickly slashed their way through the fray and became one of my all time favorite books the odyssey is in part the story of the hero odysseus a man so driven by love for his wife his son
713,The Odyssey,Homer,5,here we are again having read chapman s odyssey it was soon clear that richmond lattimore s more clear muscular seeming but sometimes surprisingly understated verse would not be aiming for the elegant rhyming form i had become familiar with if with difficulty and i suspect because i read rather quickly not always digesting all that was said but i don t think this is at all laziness on lattimore s part part of the praise for his translation is for fidelity because the almost prose lik
714,The Odyssey,Homer,5,for all practical purposes the odyssey is the sequel to the earliest well known surviving work in western literature the iliad the epic of gilgamesh while at least num num years older is neither as well known nor as influential as homer s work unlike many sequels in the present era however the odyssey actually seems to be an improvement in some respects on the original and stands quite well as an independent work odysseia—the poem s name in greek since herodotus called it that in t
716,The Odyssey,Homer,5,now i m showing off i m not going to write a review for the odyssey i think that thousands of years of influence and praise speak for themselves however i will tell you what happened when i was reading the last books of the poem in which penelope is reunited with her husband in those days i happened to be home alone while alec was in olney dog sitting his mother s dogs well during that time alec had to fight against terrible storms that put his commute in peril and isolated him from
718,The Odyssey,Homer,1,i usually don t rate books num star but the odyssey was dreadfully boring for me most of the book i found that i couldn t follow the action and/or the dialogue and it was all just extremely tedious there were a few clever moments like when odysseus had to outsmart the cyclops but the dialogue and the begats i e telamachus son of odysseus who is laertes son just got in the way of the narrative the plot felt very disjointed after reading this i m leary about reading other ancient e
719,The Odyssey,Homer,3,this edition of homer s odyssey is a modern contemporary translation by robert fagles narrated by award winning actor ian mckellen who really needs no introduction strictly as a story alone the odyssey doesn t exactly grip me although it has its moments i caught my mind wandering at times maybe i have some of that ancient roman bias for the trojans as i am enjoying the aeneid much more credit to virgil still the rich descriptions of scene and celebration of dialog are entertaining enoug

723,The Odyssey,Homer,5,not only a classic but a great adventure as well num august num athens there are two books which i believe form the foundation of western literature as we know it one of them is the bible and the other is the odyssey the odyssey is a story that has everything in it adventure action and even erotica originally it was an oral poem that was passed down by ancient greek bards who would travel the land and in return for food and shelter would tell the inhabitants of the towns the visited the

739,The Odyssey,Homer,5,homer s the odyssey is so grounded in the foundation of world literature that it is largely beyond reproach and likewise beyond praise homer s two epics this and the iliad are two halves of the same foundation the journey out and the journey back the external conflict the internal conflict the war saga the family saga the two comprise such a vastness that it would seem that most if not all western literature are the offspring of homer from the iliad we have war peace moby d

743,The Odyssey,Homer,5,it s the odyssey you should probably read it fitzgerald s version is very readable and not particularly scholarly so it s ideal for actually reading i doubt it s much use if you re looking for a trot to read alongside the greek but since i don t know greek well it suits my purposes everyone who reads the thing seems to have an idea about the one thing the book is about which is ridiculous since even in translation you can see that it s a bunch of different stories stitched togethe
744,The Odyssey,Homer,5,i ve been reading this aloud to my kids over the past several months this translation is a must read very readable and great flow 
746,The Odyssey,Homer,3,i obviously like it guys it was interesting to finally know odysseus s odyssey 🤔🤔 and it was very nice too to read such and old book so i understand why i like more the song of achilles of even the lightning thief because what i love most about book is how they make you relate to the characters on so many levels is no just a story of someone pluss there was soo muuch weeping to much anyway this was on my list soo checked ✅
748,The Odyssey,Homer,5,my first odyssey and so my favorite i ve read this edition a few times and it s always a new experience the rhythm of this translation is smooth and rolling but it can have a narcotic effect in which the sounds and melody even in silence lull you away from the language and the story this isn t a bad thing of course especially if you re hanging out on circe s island or eating a little lotus maybe this is why episodes and words resonate differently on repeated readings i find the book
749,The Odyssey,Homer,2,this was one of the novels we had to read in my freshman year english class i did not rlly like this book i didn’t know what was going on i just knew enough to pass my tests and such over this book i did love the greek gods involved in it because i have always wanted to know more about them overall the amount of characters thrown in was overwhelming at times but i mean i had to read it right oh well

759,The Odyssey,Homer,4,i very much enjoyed the middle of this book but found that the beginning and the end dragged quite a bit very little is known about homer he was greek and it s thought that he lived between num and numbc there is a book by robert graves called homers daughter that i must get around to borrowing from the library that book imagines that homer was actually a young woman the odyssey is set in the bronze age about num bc just thinking of the age of this story mesmerised me this book was writte
761,The Odyssey,Homer,3,as with most books high schoolers at my learning institution are required to read i heard horror stories about the odyssey from older siblings whiny facebook friends etc needless to say my expectations were low i did have a little faith in it though it s a classic for a reason if i could sum it up in a word meh the characters were uninteresting especially odysseus himself i feel bad for the ancient greeks who had to regard him as a hero considering he is a major jerk being a fair
762,The Odyssey,Homer,4,knowing they were foundational and mistakenly thinking them something like the oldest books in the world i read homer s iliad and odyssey on my own sometime during junior high school i have no idea what translation i used except that it was more prose than poetry the more poetic versions by fitzgerald and lattimore had to wait for college unlike the iliad the odyssey was actually fun as it has a compex plot held together by odysseus overarching oft frustrated compulsion to get back to his
763,The Odyssey,Homer,5,this is an incredible read provided you are interested in a plot driven story i usually am not what is happening around the next corner of a story is generally less interesting to me than what the character will do with it how that event will change them but that isn t a factor here instead in this story you see the height of plot driven story telling and it is fascinating both for what it reveals about ancient greece and for how it structures itself truly so many tropes in moder
764,The Odyssey,Homer,5,it has been many years since i read the odyssey and while i appreciated it i don’t remember actually enjoying it wilson’s translation changed that she keeps to iambic pentameter throughout which allows the text to read like poetry as was the original intent it moves swiftly and fluidly and i absolutely loved it 
766,The Odyssey,Homer,3,oh my god it was alternately so tedious and so beautiful but i think more on the tedious side so many lists of names good lord still the descriptions are really surprisingly lovely even in translation also lots of interesting details about like what kind of furniture people had which i m always super interested in it s interesting how their culture was really different from ours in a lot of ways but you don t get that same feeling of i m reading about aliens wtf that you get from e

768,The Odyssey,Homer,5,for reasons i don t remember i gave the odyssey three stars i am now thinking that this text is probably above being rated since whether or not one likes homer is beside the point i am changing my rating to five stars with full admission that giving a rating to on one of the most important founding texts of western civilization is to take oneself a little to seriously 
769,The Odyssey,Homer,5,this is more obligatory post than anything else what can i say about the odyssey that hasn t been said before it is complex violent and beautiful it makes you question what it means to be a leader and how pride can cause you a heap of trouble this is probably my numth or numth time reading the odyssey and i still enjoy it am in fact still finding new things

778,The Odyssey,Homer,5,this is a story of winds out of hand fate/destiny oars doing your best and boulders difficulties it’s much better and more complex and richer in myth than the iliad the homecoming journey of odysseus who deserved to be the successor of achilles shield as in successor in glory achillies is the muscles odysseus is the brains odysseus reached his homeland killed all suitors then it all came down to this going back to his wife to reintegrate with her to sleep again in her bed bu
780,The Odyssey,Homer,5,this translation of the book reads like a novel not a poem it’s the first time i’ve been able to read poetry without forgetting each word the moment i read it this is in large part thanks to the kind of language emily wilson uses in her introduction she explains that other translations often use some sort of old fanshioned english which makes reading the book unnecessarily complicated the story itself is very old filled with customs and ideas that are hard to understand for a modern weste
782,The Odyssey,Homer,5,rereading the odyssey this time in emily wilson s recent and much discussed translation brought to mind how much this classic speaks to issues of our own day to give a single example a major theme of the text and i had largely forgotten this is the importance of hospitality towards strangers a theme that is also all over the hebrew bible when antinous rebukes the swineherd for bringing the beggar actually odysseus in disguise to the suitors feast his words sound familiar do we not h
783,The Odyssey,Homer,5,i have a soft spot for the history of how we learned things and because of that wilson s introduction and translator s notes are the highlight of this book for me i have no real background in classics and at most a high school level of knowledge about mythology and the ancient world and i found her thorough explanation of what we do and don t know about who homer was when the odyssey is from and the cultural and historical context of the poem to be enlightening fascinating and very access
784,The Odyssey,Homer,5,emily wilson’s translation of the classic tale of odysseus’ voyage and return home is very readable and her notes on the text provide some context without overwhelming the reader i enjoyed her version but based on the passages i compared this version is a little too breezy to replace my much loved robert fitzgerald translation 
785,The Odyssey,Homer,5,joe sachs translation is clean clear and accurate it lacks the poetry of many other translations but there are plenty of those and not enough of these the only one it compares to is lattimore but sachs treads more lightly more like odysseus himself and less like achilles sachs wisely appends his introduction to the end of the work a gesture of good sense and humility like peter green sachs spent a whole career reading and questioning and talking about the classical greeks before s
786,The Odyssey,Homer,4,this story brings new meaning to the expression about fish and house guests i much preferred this to the iliad the story took one on a winding path very literally with interesting characters if indeed a bit hypocritical blood thirsty and vengeful i ended up with the fagels s translation and it definitely made the experience easier should someone wish to read the odyssey i would recommend that version 
787,The Odyssey,Homer,3,there tends to be two types of people those who prefer the iliad and those who prefer the odyssey i am for the former not the latter despite this i do still find the odyssey to be an entertaining greek epic one which i can t wait to reread in the newly released emily wilson translation

807,The Odyssey,Homer,3,ans so ends my summer with homer finally after many short reading sessions spliced in between other and easier things to read the trouble with that method is of course the obligatory re reading of passages to try and pick up the forgotten thread but i did it with only the help of a small and barely helpful dictionary of mythology to guide me in my ignorance i could have used a good looking and enthusiastic classics scholar to point out the hidden wonders that i undoubtedly missed but
808,The Odyssey,Homer,5,i read some of the reviews of this book and nearly vomited this is one of the best books in literature ever it is far superior to the iliad for many reasons and while it s not perfect it has incredible value take away that value and you have some scenes of this book yes it s a poem don t argue with me that are stunning in their brutal and bold portrayal of what a man will do when his family is in danger it s still just as worthwhile fagles translation is what you must read because
811,The Odyssey,Homer,5,the odyssey written by homer is an age old tale that has lasted the test of time it is the touching story of one mans harrowing journey home odysseus has been kept prisoner by the nymph calypso for seven years on top of his attempted journey home after the trojan war in all he has been gone twenty years the grey eyed goddess athena makes an appeal to the other gods to allow odysseus his freedom and safe passage home after all these years the other gods agree and odysseus starts his long jou

813,The Odyssey,Homer,5,a literary epic of epic proportions homer s the odyssey is a masterpiece that is delightful riveting enchanting and captivating stirring up the deepest emotions with playful discourses passionate exhortations daring adventures and romantic escapades i think what i enjoyed most about the odyssey was its pertinent and applicable flair that i so often found myself citing in reference or application to a specific challenge or problem frequently felt in numst century america we as westerners 
814,The Odyssey,Homer,5,it is another masterpiece by homer this is an epic journey home of odysseia from troja war this journey took num years and lots of adventures while this journey odysseia will be faced with call of the sirens cave of the cyclops and obsession of some greek gods as a language imaginary and the story is just a big piece of epic if i compare with iliad iliad is repeated some scene and also conversations i don’t mean in a bad way i mean story in iliad brewed slowly make the reader understa
816,The Odyssey,Homer,5,everything about this new translation is a class act it brought the times and ways of odysseus return to ithaca to life the poetic translation was fun to read but it supported a gorgeous revisiting of the book that endowed it with a freshness that surprised and delighted me i read it slowly making my own notes and commentary as i went a long letting me capture the things that seemed so familiar as to seem contemporary or things so alien that i could not see any relationship to my own cul
817,The Odyssey,Homer,5,fagels s translation of the iliad and the odyssey are both magnificent highly readable with forceful and direct prose that i have to imagine since i have no expertise are closer to the experience of the original oral texts for me the measure if the success of the translation is whether it allows a text this old and culturally removed from the reader to retain its emotional impart this one does though unexpectedly for me anyway it s most compelling moments actually belong to pen
818,The Odyssey,Homer,3,i was not sure whether i was going to enjoy the odyssey but i actually did the translation was mostly entertaining and fun to read it is clear why the tale of odysseus journey home is so popular i would like to go back to this someday and reread it because my class that i was reading it for made us skip a few chapters in the middle and i don t feel like going back and reading the chapters i missed right now my only complaint is that at some parts it was slow and i became bored because it
819,The Odyssey,Homer,5,i ve decided to treat this book as a treatise on manners i m puzzled about one thing though the next time i throw a party and have an uninvited guest is it more appropriate to impale him on one of my bronze spears or to cut off his genitals feed them to my dog and then cut off his nose hands and feet at least i can now rest assured that slaughtering my unfaithful women servants is a task best left to my henchmen 
820,The Odyssey,Homer,3,update i have rated it lower last time was num stars and this time is num i was going to go as low as two but the chapters about polyphemus and the destruction of the suitors at least keep me interested if this wasn t a literary classic i would probably rate it lower but i understand its importance in canonical and historical realms and respect it as such 
821,The Odyssey,Homer,3,the spicy tale of odysseus protracted and wandering return to ithaca and his wife penelope after the events of the iliad i was surprised to find the epic so accessible some of the violent scenes are very unpleasant and superfluous but some passages and ideas are luminous and it is easy to see why homer was so beloved and the work has survived when i visited ithaca it was nice to know the story 
822,The Odyssey,Homer,4,a wonderful adventure so much better than the iliad one of those classic stories that you have heard of bits and pieces from here and there probably from the odd movie this is the book a lot of it has been taken from sirens and cyclops and vengeful gods king s and queens and backstabbing traitors for a book that was written so long ago this quite the action packed adventure well written with the odd twist here and there i ll be re reading this one day 
824,The Odyssey,Homer,5,one of the most important books ever written the very fabric of storytelling is woven with the wily hands of the ever crafty odysseus meet the hero who inspired all the rest and discover that he is not so much of a hero as a man who wants to get home above all he is human painfully gloriously tragically definitely so

Rowling,5,oh dear as much as i love all the other harry potter books this one will always be dearest to me why because it is longest one still i remember reading it in a day when it first got out because sirius don’t think i’ll need to explain more about that because the da meetings are awesome and luna is lovely because it is truly admirable that j k rowling created the most despicable fictional character ever obviously i rate this with num out of num stars

919,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,5,having known what was going to happen in this book didn t make it any easier for me in fact it was worse because you know you can t do anything and you re actually expecting the bad things to happen but the thing is the first time i read these books i only liked them i wasn t attached to neither the story nor the characters i simply enjoyed them all that changed with this reread in which i found myself surprisingly immersed in them and i was a victim of what most book lovers suffer ca

924,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,3,i ve been told this was the most difficult to read of the series and i found it to be true harry is full of teen angst and spends a lot of the book furious and being quite infuriating at the fact that nothing is happening and that when things do happen he s not allowed to be involved of course not being allowed do things should never stop a boy like harry potter from getting involved except that amazingly it does this book isn’t really so much about harry potter but about all the other
925,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K.

931,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,5,i wasn t so enthusiastic about revisiting the order of the phoenix the water’s run deep in this one and i admit while dodging flying rotten tomatoes that this is my least favourite harry potter book because so many awful stuffs happened and will continue to happen in the later books… this is the mark of a turning point for harry and his friends his innocent fascination of the wizarding world is clearly over and the situations he’ll have to face now will be darker and full of losses with each

939,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,5,wonderful book only complaint i ever heard was it was too short still the emotional toll of this book is heavier than the ones before and it is more a young adult book than a youth book as i ve pointed out before the original generation reading these books had more time to mature between the publishing date of each book now they can be bought all together harry goes through some amazingly tough times and doesn t handle some of them too well read these books before you simply turn

947,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,5,“you care so much you feel as though you will bleed to death with the pain of it ” the quote above hurts so much for how true it is with each instalment to this series the emotions are heightened as i fear for an ever increasingly large cast of ever increasingly lovable characters this is the book that gave us the hateful umbridge and made us first realise our misplaced trust of authority it is also the book that gave us the members of the order of the pheonix and showed us once again what tru

987,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,1,this is the worst harry potter book the characterization is unbelievable and annoying taking the various holes in the world j k has created with harry potter and throwing them in the face of the reader with the expectation that they will accept anything at this point events in the world that main characters and by extension the reader find outrageous and crazy are accepted by everyone else in the world without adequate reasons for their acceptance harry whines incessantly throughout this
988,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,4,it s difficult to review harry potter as individual books because in my opinion j k rowling wrote so well as a whole that i feel a difficult task to do however i will try it in harry potter and the order of phoenix the protagonists aren t so innocent especially because of the circumstances they have to face and in my opinion this is the novel that marks the beginning of an increasingly and suffocating darkness that will grow until the climax of the seventh and last book as a great fan
989,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K.

1001,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,5,the numth book about harry potter is no doubt the longest and at least to me the hardest one to read every scene is tinged every happy moment soon ruined by new ugliness or at least it feels that way more than physical violence the psychological effects of this novel are what make it so bad we have severe bullying not just by students but also by teachers most notably by umbridge plots torturous longing … basically the situation is hopeless and hogwarts feels less and less like a saf
1002,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,5,the longest book by more than a hundred pages in the series many have complained that this is one of their least favorites and i admit it was my numnd least favorite for a very long time when i finally re read it a few years ago i revised my opinion it s now one of my top favorites when i first read it as a young adult i was really annoyed with harry s actions and attitude i got frustrated with his frustrations and anger it s funny that it took me getting older to actually become mor
1003,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,4,this is probably the best entry in the harry potter series to this point in my personal opinion the novels begin as average stories at best with rowling trying to gain a proper control over her writing voice and style they do show delightful promise with the worldbuilding and some sense of nice enough characters but all in all it s clear that marketing played a huge hand in selling the books early on i m not cynical enough to say marketing was all that did it rowling has a distinctly bri

1014,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,5,despite all odds harry overcomes all by refusing to let his superiors define how he sees the world and chooses to act upon it in a book filled with mental and physical struggles friendship and courage help pull harry through a life that was destined to be far from ordinary when that is all he desires to be this book makes you laugh out loud most likely at ron s immature comments or at luna s strange and yet charming demeanour the next minute it makes you angry most likely at umbridge s

Rowling,5,hogwarts again back when everything is beautiful and magical num from the third book every movie cut a lot of events from the book and from this one the most so far the book was more emotional more aggressive and more dark this time the wizarding world is more likely to the real world lies to hide the truth minister afraid to lose his chair so do anything he can to hide the truth j k rowling really showed us the ugly world in this one it was too intense so sad and hurtful it sta
1016,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,5,this marks the third time i have read book num in the harry potter series i m not much of an intelligent review will ensue as i am incredibly bias and affectionate towards this series i grew up with harry potter and waited anxiously year after year for each book and subsequently movie to be released i am an avid fan and will never tire or become bored of the wizarding world i look forward to the day when my two young children are old enough to start the harry potter journey on their own it
1017,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,4,quite an outstanding book i felt like this one in particular focussed less on harry fighting the evil around him and more on fighting himself don t get me wrong he s irritating and whiny for almost the entirety of the book but he also grows in a touching way dumbledore too he isn t present for much of the plot but his conversation with harry at the very end was heart rending in an entirely different way altogether this is longer and darker than any book in the series previously but it
1018,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,5,this numth and longest book of the series describes the happenings after the triwizard tournament and return of lord voldemort not that many of the students believe the story of hewhomustnotbenamed’s return however this numth year is about so much more than school although this is a crucial year what with the owls and career choices ahead or a mystery to be solved it’s about change about growing older about the stakes getting higher growing danger and the human factor in everything it’s ab
1019,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,5,rereading this book now just made me realise how much i ve forgotten about this beautiful world and i m forever grateful to beth for pulling back in this book never fails to bring me to tears i think this was actually the first book which made me bawl my eyes out for a character or rather shed a tear while reading the thing is the harry potter movies are all well and great but you just don t realise the amount of information they left out until you reread the book i absolutely forgot ab
1020,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K.

Rowling,5,num num / num i loved this i think it is much darker than the previous ones which i found super interesting besides the matured the characters is remarkable my favorite so far i plan to write a review of the entire series when i finish with the next two books and it will be completely honest because although i don t consider myself a big harry potter fan i m enjoying these books much more that i thought i would 
1023,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,5,harry is whiny and dolores umbridge is the most frustratingly evil character i ve ever read in a book 
1026,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,3,since pretty much everyone i know has read these books i figure reviewing them is pretty pointless but with the new book coming out in a couple of days i have to go through them beginning to end to make the reviews more entertaining i will be doing them in a variety of unexpected formats for this review i will be writing as an unnamed member of the bush administration so how long until we can get this rowling woman into gitmo i mean really have you read this book it s an num page diatr
1027,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,5,first read in num re read in num i know some people who complained about harry being so angry in this book but i think he has the right to be he’s traumatized over voldemort’s return and cedric’s death very few people believe he’s telling the truth about voldemort and he’s being kept in the dark by the people he trusts and cares about the formation of dumbledore’s army is enjoyable because it finally gives harry a chance to take on a leadership role and his fellow students get to learn
1028,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,3,phew i ve finally finished this beast of a book it s pretty normal for me to finish a book this size in a week or so but this one has took me over a month to consume if there are any hard core potter fans here you may not want to read this review as it seems that for this book that i m in the minority first of all i ll begin by saying that i do like this series and i can totally appreciate why rowlings incredible creation has captured the imaginations and hearts of so many but this
1029,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,4,probably closer to num num stars this one took me a while to get into we pick up right where we left after cedric died really and absolute refusal by everyone in authority that dumbledore and harry are completely off their rocker i felt so sorry for him but is it awful to say i got bored of that after a while the narrative of him being trapped in that whirlpool made me less enthusiastic about reading this one however the last num/num was amazing the battle at the department of mysteries everyt

1033,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,5, num reread edit this book is still one of my favorites of all time because we see a more cynical and angry side to harry which is completely understandable due to the nature of the last four years he d endured and how everyone in the wizarding community basically shut him out slandering his name then again the one issue i had towards harry in this book still stands during this re read his horrible treatment of ron hermione they don t deserve his outbreaks they re his most l
1034,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,5,indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike this book is one of my favourite books in the entire series and i know a lot of people don t like this one but to me it s full of information story progression and darker as lord voldemort has returned and is gaining more power plot harry is once again at number num privet drive and is feeling mad and restless feeling left in the dark after no news of the wizarding world from either his friends or the order but troubl
1035,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,4,this was the book that made me really fall on love with the harry potter series up to this point i was enjoying the series but the order of the phoenix really amps up the mythology and the drama and harry s growing maturity makes the novel seem that much richer and more nuanced things i loved the introduction of the order meeting the quirky luna lovegood the delight in loathing dolores umbridge training for dumbledore s army harry s occlumency lessons and learning about the prophecy b

1038,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,J.K. Rowling,4,after reading this book for a second time i ve decided to dock it a star it s still a good book very well written but i have some grievances to bring to ms j k s attention spoiler warning at num pages it is very laborious to get through this tome when every other sentence brings a new disaster/ problem for harry drama is fine but to this level at this length is just overdoing it starting with the dementor attack in the first few pages and continuing through umbridge s evilness a

1040,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,2,spoilers ahead what the f words can t begin to express my disappointment i bought mockingjay the first day it came out and i was preparing myself for a truly epic novel one worthy of its predecessors i loved the hunger games it was fast paced thrilling suspenseful catching fire wasn t as good but it was still enjoyable i was majorly impressed by the game arena i wasn t let down by catching fire though i figured it was just a transition novel build up to what would undoubtedly
1041,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,i’m never very good at predicting outcomes nothing i could’ve predicted would have been quite as good as this although i did get close a very distant close on a few things and i was right in saying that it wouldn’t be walking through a field of flowers and sunshine a book like this just couldn’t be it s good and yet not good because it’s good in a very heartbreaking chilling haunting intense way katniss is a different person from the first two books i found her softer more thought
1042,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,update num/num/num so of course i had to read it again after getting only half of the story from the mockingjay movie unsurprisingly cried and cried again my feelings basically remain the same about this installment structurally the novel is quite messy there is such a big game going on and katniss motivations and actions don t always make sense to me but the ending is brilliant especially the final chapters i need something to cheer me up asap let s face it a series is only as good a

1045,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,2,[ this just in the movie adaptation mockingjay part num was absolutely outstanding i ve seen both of the other movies for this series and while i enjoyed them greatly the third instalment was on another level entirely it s one of the best movies i ve seen in a very very long time good job movie people you made a meh book into a stellar piece of cinema ] those two stars are for the last ten pages which were absolutely outstanding probably the best ten pages of the series the num pages
1046,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,i never thought i d ever rate this book below a num but here i am and the only reason i gave it a three even is because the first two books of the hunger games were just so good they brought this one up by three stars honestly i’ve waited so long for mockingjay to come out i practically peed my pants on august numth and now that i’ve finally finished the book thanks to a full day of obsessive reading meals not included all i can feel is…annoyance annoyance and disappointment annoyance

1050,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,mockingjay the final book in suzanne collin s hunger games trilogy for a year i had been anxiously waiting to read the about the adventures of the rebels the hopefully happy ending how wrong was i there is an ending but it is not as happy as most expected it to be the rebels fought they won but in a sense collin s shows us that when violence is used to such extremes no one wins yes a winner is declared but the sadness and loss of both sides proves that no one really wins in war
1051,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,2,how do i begin to convey my disappointment i suppose it all comes down to expectations and as mine were not met i feel vastly underwhelmed and a little bit devastated when i read hungergames i was enthralled i thought katniss was intelligent resourceful and displayed tremendous strength in character moreover katniss’s arc appeared to parallel with the overall arc of the story/series as katniss grew more bold so did the remaining characters and the uprising initiative i expected this

1053,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,1,here s seven reasons why this trilogy sucks num katniss has the personality of a vegetable num peeta is a needy little baker boy i’ll never get over how the author can justify his camouflage techniques born as a result from his cake decorating experience…… num the world is completely unacceptable and unbelievable no collective nation would be so morally depraved as to watch the murder of children for entertainment i cannot accept this idea num this book did not make me think as everything is on
1054,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,below is my original review i m leaving it as it s still essentially how i feel still i have however decided that the overall story of the book rates a higher rating than i originally gave you ll see below the biggest problem for me was that katniss seemed to grow some throughout the first and the second book yet slid back and forth/up and down throughout this i just didn t think it was still katniss in some ways to each of course and i d say try it yourself and see how you feel/what you
1055,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,i guess sometimes our emotional bones need to be re broken in order to set them right maybe this was a common experience for those who read this book but a lot of its most emotional points were like reading a bizarre dream about the last few years of my own life i’m not going to go into it because that would be like an unacceptable amount of over share even for me that’s just to say that i have no ability to be objective about it this story real or not real i love mockingjay like i lov

1065,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,spoilers when i first read mockingjay i was a silly little fourteen year old drunk up on the fast paced action and immediate danger katniss faced in the first two novels given her weakness and exclusion from important events not to mention my almost num month wait for its release i was bitterly disappointed perhaps reading now i appreciate mockingjay more because of my lower expectations perhaps it is because i can look at it in a new light perhaps its both i will not delete my origin

1071,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,1,beware of spoilers what the hell was mockingjay it was dreadful i thought katniss was not fighting as much as she should have been yes her role is very important and she is the leader of the rebellion however most of the fighting was done by either gale finnick and others katniss was either in the hospital or just being weak whining about almost everything and i know that katniss is strong and intelligent and a fighter so why was it not super epic snow s death was not as epic as i t
1072,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,all spoilers chapter num a memorial of sorts some final books in trilogies spend time carefully recounting what happened in prior books some jump right into the action mockingjay has ash and despair and the end of a life our heroine once had it does not feel like a stirring call to arms it does not feel like a revolution is about to happen it feels like the end of things it feels like death this is the beginning of the book chapter num the brave rebels of district num a humorless communist stat
1073,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,okay so this will be more of a rant actually it will be a full on rant i know everyone is entitled to their own opinion but that means i can too say what i think of this books and of how others perceived it and let it be noted that while i enjoyed this series it is by no means one of my top series so i will be as objective as i can be i’ve talked to a lot of people and read a lot of opinions on this that really actually made me mad in a way there are so many complaints out there and
1074,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,loved this the second time around can t believe i used to think this was the worst of the series i think this was just as good if not better now there was so much raw emotion and just ah i cried along with katniss while she had to face just sorrow after destruction over and over again this story is so violent and bleak but i love it i love that there s still some small rays of hope present i m also very content with the way the trilogy ended now where as the first time i read this t

1076,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,book review num of num stars to mockingjay the third book in the hunger games young adult trilogy published in num and written by suzanne collins although i loved this book it s my least favorite of the three in the series as it s less about the actual challenge to survive against the other districts which is what made the books so fun for me it s all about revolution against the government and who is really fighting for the cause full of commentary on the world and society in general 
1077,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,first read num rating num stars second read june num rating num stars i am so emotional right now this book has ruined me just as much the second time around in fact i think it hurt even more this time i feel like i garnered a greater understanding for katniss motives and her final all consuming sadness i also understood the ending a lot better and her decisions for the life she chose felt more real than the ending my younger self had anticipated during my first read of this this series

1081,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,a book without compassion but somehow full with hope mockingjay is the kind of book that comes from an author who believes in the story she is telling knowing the dark path she must take the reader to accomplish it and not from someone who wants to please her fans we already live in a very sick world and that’s why i’ll never be against a book with a happy ending but we must stay grounded and mockingjay is one of the few if not the only young adult book that shows with loud rage that o

1084,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,for the past few weeks i ve been viewing mockingjay as a bomb about to go off but while it wasn t quite that bad i wasn t entirely off the mark either i m still recovering from the wringer this series put me through which is why i ve been suffocating hugging my parrot for the past couple of hours you know when you take a month long vacation you ve been planning for ages and it s all you d wished for and more but at the end of the trip you re still the happiest and most relieved when yo
1085,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5, panem et circenses and so it all ends i m happy and sad at the same time as the hunger games is by far my favorite ya series actually i m not sure i d really label it young adult because when i think of the genre i think stupid teenagers unnecessary love triangles and/or angst and silly decisions this trilogy is nothing of the sort for me yes we have the whole katniss peeta gale thing but it loses its importance in the bigger picture i love katniss i love her because she s broke
1086,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3, dum de dum i m here to edit this for spoilers and whatnot since i wasn t very good with that before also maybe i should take out some of the random screams of frustration and stuff hmmm tears out hair aghhhh aggghhh just … what is it with these books really i don t even know where to begin they frustrate the heck out of me especially this one just the sight of these books makes me want to strangle someone and it s not that they re horrible because they re not horrible they re
1087,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,the hunger games series is the numrd on my list of top num all time favorite series after game of thrones and harry potter in this book katniss agrees to become the symbol of the resistance the mockingjay katniss made a very good leading character the partnership of peeta and katniss worked well together at all times even in the last book when they had their most difficults times it was more politically charged and lacked the amount of action as the first two but it was good and i liked it
1089,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,actual rating num num stars ► i won t go below num num because i ate it up in one day the very same way i did the first time about that can i just apologize to my fellow buddy readers i m the worst really overall i m glad how things turned out in the end but i would be lying if i said that i loved this novel warning i ll try to keep my thoughts free of spoilers but if you never read it perhaps it s safer if we go on separate ways here bye and may the odds be ever in your favor blows
1090,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,num num to num num stars this is a very difficult book for me to review as i really liked the first two installments of this trilogy the hunger games and catching fire this one i rounded up barely to num stars because the quality of the writing was there and the basic message and results of the events of the book while not necessarily uplifting remained true to the basic tone of the series which was dark from the beginning as someone who is very okay with endings that aren t the traditional happy
1091,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,update november num did you like the hunger games but feel let down by mockingjay did you wish it ended differently even though i loved it i longed for an ending that put katniss back at the center of the story and made her growth a powerful symbol for a panem about to take flight so instead of complaining i wrote that ending http //mockingjayrethink wordpress com/ give it a read and see what you think i d love to hear whether this is an ending that works for you original review begi
1092,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,2,i m bumping this because i finally watched mockingjay num and as someone who loved the first two books but did not like this one i have to say the movie was way better than the book all the whiny angsty katniss bs was gone and you are left feeling hopeful i m so glad they made the movie better than this book re read review you know what no just no no i ve read this twice now and thought maybe i would have a new appreciation for it i just re read the first two and loved them but this one
1093,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,after surviving two hunger games katniss finds herself as the face of a revolution can katniss lead the rebels to victory against president snow and the capitol the hunger games trilogy comes to a conclusion in this volume a conclusion that tends to polarize people without giving too much away the ending was actually one of the parts of the book i liked the best the story coming out of the previous volume catching fire sees katniss uniting the districts against the capitol primarily thro
1094,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,i had trouble rating this book because i am really not sure how i felt about it i didn’t like the first half of this book and was bored but then later on it got better this book isn’t terrible or bad but it didn’t blow my mind like it did for many other people this entire series is so hyped up and everyone seems to love it so much…everyone except me my love for dystopian books ended a while ago and so i think that’s why i don’t love this series that much i really liked the second book but
1095,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,there are much worse games to play first time i read mockingjay i hated it second time i read it i did not hate it and now the third time i read it i think that suzanne couldn t have ended this trilogy any better third time reading it and it still emotionally destroyed every single part of me like i ve already said i can t say anything about this trilogy that hasn t already been said before so i m gonna keep this short i don t think that i will ever read any book or trilogy that wil
1096,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,dark with lots of sacrifices and innocent victims the description of the main character s feelings and grief tore me apart i can t help comparing the hunger games world with the real world issues it was a decent ending to the trilogy 
1097,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,num num stars “what i need is the dandelion in the spring the bright yellow that means rebirth instead of destruction the promise that life can go on no matter how bad our losses that it can be good again ” i ve read this series a total of four times the first time i finished it i felt indifference some time had passed since i read catching fire and i didn t feel emotionally invested in the characters or story to care though i remember feeling outraged at a certain character s death i d

1099,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,i don t know how to feel about this it was too much 
1100,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,2,edited num/num/num i have never had any desire to watch those hunger games movies because once i took a look at the hunger games movie poster featuring jennifer lawrence i know she is a miscast and i see that even up to the third hunger games movie lawrence still shows no sight of improvement three movies come by she still looks like a well fed model who just stands there looking pretty instead of a struggling brave heroine link http //en wikipedia org/wiki/the hung see what i mean note 
1101,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,i guess sometimes our emotional bones need to be re broken in order to set them right maybe this was a common experience for those who read this book but a lot of its most emotional points were like reading a bizarre dream about the last few years of my own life i’m not going to go into it because that would be like an unacceptable amount of over share even for me that’s just to say that i have no ability to be objective about it this story real or not real 
1102,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,re read in december numknum still amazed by how much i love this series this book was beautifully written 
1103,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,note hey i have written a fanfic and you ve got to read it peeta mellark in real life puppy peeta eyes spoiler and swear alert a super rushed review coming from a still emotional peeniss peetaxkatniss and finnie finnickxannie fan please forgive my obscenities and my nonsense ramblings this is not a rant or maybe it is but don t worry collins i still love you sweetheart finally i finished reading this disturbing book please please please don t let that baby blue color cover
1104,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,i didn t click the spoiler button i am not going to talk directly about the book for a paragraph or two after that i might say things that will spoil your reading experience or i may not read on past the really boring theory shit at your own risk i had a great deal of fun reading this book i had almost as much fun reading one star reviews for mockingjay originally i thought i d quote from them and skewer some of the criticisms but i m trying to be a nicer goodreader so i m not going to do
1105,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,i do not even know why i m writing this anything i type will be substantially inadequate and i ll never be able to point out everything that moved me about this book but i ll try also there will be spoilers at the very end of this review after many clicks of the enter button you have been warned everything about this book moved me in a good way in a bad way but it doesn t matter because i felt it all of it and that is the reason i m giving the book five stars even if i don t agre
1106,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,i have this trick where i adjust my glasses with thumb and middle finger while stealthily using the forefinger to flick away eyewater but i wasn t crying on page num just after the h is b and katniss speaks my tear ducts are just really well developed suzanne collins is excellent at pacing avoiding the trap of overusing the cliffhanger or slowing down too much and losing attention she has a graceful hand when using humor to ease tension i especially liked the parts when one c
1107,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,i had considered not doing a review for this book because really the series doesn t need any help whatsoever from me it can stand on it s own just fine but i feel an obligation to share my admiration and love for this series katniss has narrowly escaped the claws of the capitol she is the face of the rebellion and the strain of that responsibility shows nothing is clear cut nothing is easy and nothing makes sense the suspense the tension and the electric air is apparent and it won t ma
1108,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,when i first read mockingjay five years ago i didn t like it very much i thought the ending was rushed i thought it was boring that katniss spent so much time wandering around in a confused funk and i thought it was much darker and more depressing than the previous books in the hunger games series but even though it was my least favorite of the trilogy i decided to reread it after seeing both mockingjay movies surprisingly i liked the book a little better this time around the problems i
1109,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,katniss final battle against snow and coin in the overthrow of the capital comes full center in the final volume of the hunger games from a psychological point of view the writer does a good job of showing how difficult a decision it is for her to take on the identity of the mockingjay symbol of the revolution and the weight of its implications i think that here we also see a bit more about the challenges of being in the spotlight and living up to others expectations often against one
1110,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,i literally forget num of this book i maybe remembered num aspects of the plot it was amazing and yes terrifying to read mockingjay again i remember reading it the first time thinking that it flew by really fast and i didn t think so this time it was even more amazing the second time around i know this isn t the most beloved book in the series but it was pretty amazing in my opinion all the stars 
1111,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,oh my gosh i just finished this and one word of advice do not read this during history class if you do you will look incredibly awkward trying to suppress your sobs this book sent me through a roller coaster of emotions and was a fast read for me considering that i ve had a lot of homework this week i wouldn t say that it s as good as the first two but it definitely holds its own and it was a great read you love me real or not real real 
1112,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,please know before you start reading that this review is spoiler free no key plot points will be revealed but characters are discussed mockingjay the final installment of the hunger games if you saw my non review of the hunger games you know that i wasn t on the bandwagon when the hunger games was first released i wasn t even on the bandwagon when catching fire was released i think the hype of the series really turned me off and i m not sure exactly why i ve loved all the
1113,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,katniss just wanted to survive the hunger games and protect her family from the evil president snow but she inadvertently inspired all of the districts to rebel against the capital now district num has rescued katniss and wants her to become the ultimate symbol of the rebellion as the mockingjay however snow still has someone close to her held captive and katniss fears that any move she makes to aid the uprising will hurt someone she cares about i alternated between really liking this and be
1114,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,2,spoiler alert or maybe warning not to finish the last two books of the series alert i officially take back every bad thing i wrote about catching fire though it wasn t very good compared to mockingjay it was a literary masterpiece how bad is mockingjay i m struggling to find words insulting enough here s how it starts all her life katniss has hated the capital and now they ve bombed her home into rubble killing num of district num does she demand vengeance uh no she s cranky people
1115,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,hmm still the weakest in the series for sure but minus that horrific epilogue not the worst book ever lol it’s been so much fun reliving this series with wren chelsea thank you ladies it was a great ride rtc 
1116,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,i tried to keep this as spoiler free as possible i really did i don t give away major plot points but i somewhat allude to them sorry keep in mind that i m only one opinion here plenty of people didn t mind what suzanne collins did at the end of this book me i can t think of a worse possible conclusion which hurts me to say since mockingjay was easily my most anticipated release this year in the beginning the premise of this book seems to be one girl almost single handedly overthrow

1118,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,that ending had ruined me this is definitely one of my favourite trilogies of all time the reality of war and it’s aftermath embedded in the people was at the forefront here and i loved it it was so real and my heart broke the entire way through it 
1119,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,2,where do i even start as a whole this book was a let down for me and the more and more i think about it the less and less i can say i liked it there was just something off about it i re read the first two in preparation for this one and still loved them as much as the first time around and was so excited to read the conclusion to the story whereas the first two books drew me in immediately this book got off to a really slow start for me it took me until the second part of the book to fe

1122,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4, may contain some mild spoilers it looks as though the reading public is split pretty evenly on this one however i found it to be a fitting end to one of the best young adult series out there and that is not a compliment to be taken lightly as i only love about num/num of the young adult books i read the character of katniss has evolved throughout the books and i think some are disappointed because she s not as bad ass as she was in the beginning of the trilogy however i think this is fittin
1123,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,★★★★★★★☆☆☆[num/num] dear suzanne collins yeah hear me scream i get to take away one star for each of the favourite characters that you did away with ◆ finnick odair omg why did suzanne collins have to do that to muttations waaaaa ◆primrose everdeen ◆cinna ◆breaking annie cresta s and a million other girls hearts if getting rid of one of the love interests was as easy as the author made it look like then a story can have as many love triangles as the number of dumbass leadgirl worshippe
1124,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,breathtaking collins has tied up her hunger games trilogy into a package that isn t pretty but it s exactly as it needs to be these were hard books about a future where there was no hope and a young girl who was thrust into the role of reluctant hero but katniss isn t perfect isn t all powerful or all knowing all she wants is to protect her family and those few people she thinks of as friends in the course of doing so terrible decisions have to be made people are lost relationships t
1125,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,this was an outstanding trilogy with an extraordinary heroine who was somehow made more ordinary for most of this story what saved it for me was the ending though a bit rushed considering the impact and the message but it was the most resembling of the spirit and heart of katniss it felt right 
1126,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,a hero who is not only reluctant but downright surly who could blame her initially acting out of defense for a beloved sister the symbol of all that was right with her family katniss bid for survival blossomed into a movement she isn t sure she supports needless to say this contains spoilers for the previous books so don t read it if you care about such things returning to district num katniss is looking through the wreckage of her home remembering days before the games and feeling guil
1127,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,i cannot find the right words to describe how i feel about this book i am at a complete loss because the heartbreak i m suffering from only mirrors a decimal of what katniss peeta gale and many other characters experienced there is no happy ending to be found here mockingjay evokes a completely different set of emotions than the hunger games or catching fire you will feel pity you will feel anger and you will feel despair hope is not present not by a long shot but most of all i walk
1129,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,1,this book failed on almost every level i would be hard pressed to find something that the author did well i will try to be as spoiler free as possible num characterizations i never found the character of katniss to be very likeable but she reaches an all time low in this book killing innocents without batting an eye she is openly cruel even to peeta the character assassinations don t stop with her however many characters are just destroyed in this book i don t mean that they die althou
1130,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,i genuinely never understand why people say that mockingjay is bad those people in my opinion were reading this trilogy for the wrong reasons because i believe wholeheartedly that mockingjay is the most profound and poignant representation of war that i have ever read the slow realisation that coin is no better than snow katniss s unwillingness to be the face of a revolution she unknowingly started and the inescapable fact that war does not discriminate in its victims anyone and everyone
1131,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,the hunger games trilogy finishes with mockingjay by suzanne collins to me in my humble opinion this was not as powerful as the first two mockingjay wraps up the action ties up all the loose ends and makes a fitting if somewhat disjointed ending but it lacks the relentless present tense subjective narrative of katniss everdeen i was almost annoyed by katniss in the first third of the book collins spending a great deal of time describing a self loathing spiritual funk to her credit co
1132,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,update i just got home from seeing the movie and it was awesome anything that wasn t answered or was disappointing in the book was fixed and it was really satisfying just read this again and am going to see the new movie tonight there are so many things that happen in the books that aren t in the movies that it s easy to forget for instance peeta s fake leg her styling team madge being the one who gave her the mockingjay pin and gale being quite different can t wa
1134,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,2,no no why did it have to end this way such a great series coming to such an end i am very disappointed this book blech i really only rated it two stars because it was part of an originally amazing series but the book itself i really grew to dislike even hate katniss in this book she has no confidence no hope no personality she spends most of the book moping around in closets lashing out to people and on drugs in the hospital the katniss that we met in the hun

1136,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4, spoiler a hater shuts up i was astounded to find that the finale was quite rad it had enough bloodshed to satiate my wicked taste because so many characters die in this an unapologetic apocalyptic vision of modern politics and global devastation i am inclined into thinking that the theme not the pitiful character development all the rage in this ya world is collins s main concern i cannot think of a more optimistic way to earn the coveted crown of literary entitlement which
1137,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,a bit bitter and thus a bit of spoiler i would be lying if i said i liked this book as much as i liked the first two i don t really think it is merely about the ending although killing primrose almost made me want to throw away the book i guess it is also about what i have observed authors go through when ending their beautifully written trilogies most of them get too enthusiastic in writing the finale that sometimes details and events just get too crammed up in the story and most of th

1140,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,after reading this again four years later i definitely don t hate it it wasn t as good as the first two because katniss was quite idiotic at times but it was a solid finale to the trilogy

1142,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,reread with karlee and athena before seeing the part num film i m trying to figure out why i only gave this book num stars the first time through and i think the reasons were something like this prim s death is traumatic af there s no getting around that and then the splintering off of her mom and gale felt like the opposite of closure in a way and at the time i still wasn t a huge fan of everlark so i didn t like the ending and i thought it tied things up too nicely i m still not the biggest
1143,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,i finally reread this book after nearly four years of telling myself that i would i didn t love this as much as i did before sadly general thoughts while reading oh my god katniss shut up finnick and annie ahh what is life johanna let me love you fuck you capitol fuck you a thousand times over i might do a post about my different thoughts during my first read and second read soon first read num/num/num num/num/num re read num/num/num num/num/num

1145,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,one may claim that suzanne collins could have copied the telephone directory into her book and i would have still given it a num star rating maybe that s true but how could i know that i am that fanatic to do that collins didn t gave me a copy of a telephone directory instead she gave me a satisfactory conclusion to this amazing series that have been well received not only by young people but also by many adult readers oh have i dropped a bomb somewhere yes contrary to what a number of re
1146,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,the first and second books in this series are really well done and the story is interesting there is also a lot of action and katniss is at the center of most of that action now we get to the third and final book in this trilogy and i have to say it still disappoints in the third installment we are no longer in the hunger games but are now in a war with the rebels against the capitol you expect with a war and katniss being the face of the rebels that the action will be intense as it was in
1147,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,num/num stars “it takes ten times as long to put yourself back together as it does to fall apart ” i am so happy that i decided to re read these series the first time i read them was at least num years ago and therefore i was a bit hazy as to what happened in the last book maybe because it was too painful and my mind tuned it out what puts hunger games above all other dystopian ya books for me is that hunger games are so much more than just an entertaining bloody and action packed dystopian i
1148,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,opening line i stare down at my shoes watching as a fine layer of ash settles on the worn leather real or not real i finally finished mockingjay thankfully real because this just didn’t hold my attention like the fantastic and innovative the hunger games or leave me gasping as catching fire did in the end though i still loved suzanne collins violent bloody and utterly defeated conclusion to this series it just took a bit lot of effort to get through to it we aren’t left hanging where

1153,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,i think that peeta was on to something about us destroying one another and letting some decent species take over because something is significantly wrong with a creature that sacrifices its children s lives to settle its differences this was my first time rereading mockingjay although i went back to both book one and two multiple times i guess i was just too afraid of going back to this story though and sitting here recovering from the ugliest of ugly cry fests of the year i have to give
1155,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,how much can one person take katniss has survived two trips into the hunger games arena and yes she s alive but she s not living not really this third and final volume of the series is about the cost of war how it isn t tidy and exciting and fun to watch on tv it s real and awful and unpredictable and the cost is incredibly high so high it should always be the last resort okay that s me editorializing on that last point this is a messier less enjoyable yet more ultimately powerf

1161,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,i finished the trilogy this last one didn t really get to me as the other ones did i found it a bit boring to be honest i enjoyed the hunger games and the different arenas but we didn t get to that in the last book it was like the story had to be ended and it was all put into one book i was a bit disappointed with the end the ending felt too rushed for me though i am glad to have finished these books really enjoyed the first two i can definitely understand the hype around these

1165,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,i had to give it three stars because even though i have a huge list of complaints about the book it was very readable to me so big thumbs up to suzanne collins on her writing ability yay ok now that that s over with let the bitching begin i guess one of my biggest problems with the story was as this third book wrapped up it became pretty evident that there was no point to any of it no real moral of the story if you will everything katniss had tried to avoid by volunteering in her
1166,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,review num the third book of this incredible series is either loved or hated i am yet to meet someone who feels in between i personally place myself on the like it end of the spectrum for those who don t know that s in yellow and not the red of the light spectrum while i accept that this book portrays the worst sides of katniss at the same time i think that suzanne collins made the right choice in ending her book and writing it the way it was it may appear unsatisfying to many readers but i
1167,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,1,super duper spoilers coming right up if you wish to know my opinion and remain safe from the evil blood thirsty spoilers then know this i hated the second book mockingjay didn’t make me forgive collins for ruining a perfectly good series either no i don’t like mockingjay yes i’m happy the series ended here no i won’t read anything else collins writes ever and now step into the spoiler filled world of my review say hello to my bouncer mr frizzles view spoiler [mockingjay in a nutshell
1168,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,having completed the trilogy it is easier to make sweeping comments about all three books and mockingjay specifically i found the series to be a great distraction as an adult from the fast paced novels in which i usually find myself enthralled that said collins does not shy away from some large social and political commentary that is at a level that teens could understand and perhaps relate i quite enjoyed how she delved into these issues but did not do so in such a way as to inculcate t
1169,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,the third book in this trilogy demands a different kind of story than how do i get out of the arena now sadly ms collins doesn t seem as good at keeping the tension high without that brilliant device that worked so well for the last two books this book dragged and if the others hadn t been so good i would have quit there was one bit of terrible exposition that was shockingly bad ms collins had gotten better everywhere else and then that hit with a clunk i remind myself who am i l
1172,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5, num num/num stars i ve never felt more lost wandering through my thoughts upon closure of a book  if you were to ask me if i loved it  of course yes  and if you were to ask me if i was devastated and struggling because of that  again of course yes  that s because mockingjay was everything i was hoping it would be and at the same time it was so many things i was hoping it wouldn t be but if i throw my emotional side away for one moment i see the genius in how this story unfolded  becau
1173,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,“my name is katniss everdeen why am i not dead i should be dead ” after reading suzanne collins’ previous books the hunger games and catching fire i wanted to check out the final book in the “hunger games” series called “mocking jay” and man was it just as intense and horrifying as the previous two books after katniss everdeen survived the last hunger games in “catching fire ” she discovers that the capitol had destroyed her home district num as a way to teach katniss that she cannot defy the
1174,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,2,mockingly is the third and final book in the hunger games trilogy i will say this again dnf is not an option for me wether i like the book or series or not i have given this series num chances to whet my appetite or pique my intrest and this series has not done that to me this series does not deserve a review sorry guys but this whole series was bad and very repetitive i will not be reading this author again star rating for this book is a num star rating for the whole series is a num again sorr
1175,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,perhaps my hopes were too high perhaps i had become so attached to the characters that i couldn’t stand to see them change so rapidly perhaps i didn’t like being in such a dark atmosphere not that these books were ever light i don’t know what the problem was for me but whatever it was it made mockingjay a let down don’t get me wrong i still loved it to pieces but i was just expecting so much from this book and frankly i didn’t get it katniss who was once so strong was so depressing a
1176,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,this series was as i understand it marketed as young adult it s without doubt one of the darkest most tragic things i ve read in a long time being a teacher i know plenty of young adults who could handle it but do i think it betters them to do so i m not sure i gave the others four stars but this one earnt five powerful emotive and deeply moving mostly for the wrong reasons written beautifully i was dragged along by this book given neither the time nor the choice of putting it do
1177,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,2,my re read experience definitely changed my opinion of this book slightly it was still a rushed ending and some of the deaths were unnecessary but i enjoyed it more than i expected to 
1178,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,i am a complete mess right now this book is the very definition of a powerful pain that tear up your insides but you don t want to get rid of it 
1179,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,1,it s a harsh rating i know but only because i expected so much more from this book i can t be ok with how things played out in this novel the characters and this series as a whole deserved more i feel so underwhelmed right now mockingjay is a mere shadow compared to its predecessors a series that lost its way and by the third book lost a lot of heart katniss has been through a lot and so it s only natural that war changes people so i can understand if katniss isolates herself from th
1180,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,i’m rating this as the third part of one story so i’m basically rating the trilogy well it took me a long time in this book past the time when i thought i would have because at that specific point i was probably too shocked to absorb the event enough to cry but i did end up crying quite a bit toward the very end this book and this series is brilliant thank goodness collins did a good job with the whole arc of the story through all num books this is such a beautifully written story it’s s
1181,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,as the final installment of a widely loved and thoroughly praised series mockingjay has proven to be a worthy conclusion not only does it meet the high expectations set by the hunger games and catching fire but it s even more epic bleak suspenseful heartbreaking and ultimately satisfying than its predecessors in mockingjay the entire of panem is the arena and katniss finds that the true threats are more dangerous than any of the capitol s manufactured muttations could ever be colli
1182,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,2,“fire is catching and if we burn you burn with us ” understand this this was mediocre for a hunger games novel hence the num star rating i expected more from suzanne collins than this epic failure of a book that doesn t manage to conclude the series it failed to capture me and pull me in and i was wishing it would end and then i was disappointed because the ending was that much generic and ruined the entire thing for me i really wanted to love this book and there were times that i did bu
1183,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,wow just a real heart breaker and lots of er heart break suzanne collins certainly doesn t pull any punches here and poor katniss has been put through he i use to feel bad about my protagonists not anymore they have it sweet in comparison i couldn t quite go the full num stars because of the violence not that i m overly sensitive about that they re at war after all but it s the kids vs kids that gets me i also thought it was interesting that when my daughter did a book report
1184,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,finished about num minutes ago and i still can t catch my breath 
1185,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,so much respect to ms collins so much that s all i will probably ever say about this book 
1186,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,i have to say i liked the other two better but the ending is so beautiful i m so glad they get there kind of happily ever after 
1187,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,an amazing ending i dont know what to say
1189,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,the first time i read mockingjay i thought it was rushed and didn t think it stood up to the first two books in the hunger games series however once i re read it i found that the rushed feeling didn t come from a hurried and cramped writing style as many fans suggest they think collins rushed to meet a deadline but from the sense of urgency that suzanne collins masterfully injected into the battle scenes it s a war told from the point of view of one girl so of course during the scenes
1190,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,for ya fiction this is pretty intense quite a few bloodstains to clean up overall though i was somewhat exasperated at the recycled use of the premise from the first two novels i felt like whole “extreme makeover warrior edition” thing might have worked really well in the games arena but when the mockingjay takes on the capitol itself it seems to come off a bit thin and worn out to buy that a num year old kid with bad skin is the pivotal player in a war between the galactic empire and t
1191,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,1,seeing the movie reminded me how much i loathe this book mockingjay also known as the best characters die katniss is a pain in the neck katniss is really confused when it comes to men gale s character is completely ruined and peeta isn t really there oh and remember everything is okay if in the end view spoiler [you have two little babies aw i wouldn t want katniss near babies not even if they paid me hide spoiler ] but ehi it s fine cause war is really really bad but num years late
1192,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,what an amazing ending and it s so realistic the hunger games triology is on my top ten shelf when i finished reading it this morning i was shivering and crying this is not a love story this is story about surviving political games and individual fates in the machinery of the repressive society which always wants sacrifice for whatever they describe as the greater good maybe this book is labeled as dystopian but everything in it is real we live it now just watch the news 
1193,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,1,i was bored the characters i d once loved for their colour and fire fell flat the plot ended with a cop out and above all i just didn t care by the time i got to the last page a big disappointment considering how much i loved the first book in the hunger games series 
1194,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,reread num/num/num still amazing i laughed/cried/etc i can t wait for the movie next week i hope it does justice to the ending of this wonderful series perfect ending to a spectacular trilogy i will read these books over and over and over 
1196,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,wow teary conclusion this was a great series i enjoyed the story and i enjoyed the characters 
1197,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,2, and that s pretty much it 
1198,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,can t stop crying 
1199,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,wasn t disappointed with this book very awesome i ll be interested to see how the movie does lets all hope that they don t turn out like the twilight movies 
1200,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,note these reviews are old and need updating i might do that soon caution this review contains spoilers marked accordingly i should divide the third book in two because i really loved the first num parts but i don t know about the last one even though some people didn t like katniss s breakdown for me it was the right reaction she lost some friends she almost lost her life she lost the one she loved but still didn t know that she loved him o o she s been through hell twice and i
1201,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,this series is one of my all time favourites but i couldn’t help but be a little disappointed at its conclusion first of all the thing i really loved was the hunger games itself i loved the tension and suspense the arena the cannons going off all the horrors the capitol could conjure up and the gradual tracking down of the remaining tributes no i am not a psychopath and mockingjay didn’t have any of that mockingjay was all about the war so i was a teeny bit disappointed with that se
1202,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,1,contains spoilers i m so so sorry i read this i used to love the series but now i don t think i m going to be able to open those books anymore how if just by looking at them i feel like crying i knew the end was going to be sad but i didn t expect it to be cruel i knew from the start that katniss and peeta were going to end up together it s just how she suzanne collins did it that i think it was a very low move i knew she would try to get every gale fan in team peeta s board but she
1203,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,simply amazing mockingjay was everything i hoped for and so much more it lived up to all the hype it s reputation to being the most talked about the most anticipated and the most wanted book of the year you thought the hunger games and catching fire was vividly real wait till you get this book in your hands with a lot of twists i never saw coming this one will blow your ever loving mind it s astounds me how well plotted this entire series is penned it leaves you breathless i am emotion
1204,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,1,i loved the hunger games was hugely disappointed by catching fire and mockingjay just felt weak i think what annoyed me most as it did in the second book is how selfish katniss is her character was quite likeable in the first book but it became one dimensional and very unlikeable somewhere in the second book war is raging around her and her constant self centered issues become tiring really fast there is some action in the book but the story in itself is unsurprising and the anti war s
1205,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,as many others do i have mixed feelings on this book there s no doubt that suzanne collins is fantastic author her characters are no less interesting to me in this book and unlike many others i actually don t hate the plot of this book the cruel ending to prim s story fit with the message of the book in a way that i both love and hate but this book is frustrating because there s no clear way for the characters to win even the ending we wish for district num winning turns out to be just
1207,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,there are not many times that i read a series that i wish would continue with more books but the hunger games is one of those series that i feel that way about the whole trilogy gets a well deserved num star rating 
1209,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,2,updated review num/num/num warning contains spoilers am i the only one who is disappointed after reading this we all know that collins had brought out the first book the hunger games in the series which gained popularity within months why wouldn t it it had an innovative plot a brave heroine action packed pages resurgence of dystopian fiction etc etc… but as the series proceeded i felt that collins was eventually losing hold over the plot it was like she had no idea how the series wou
1210,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,with mockingjay we start off where catching fire left us katniss is with the rebels and the capitol has imprisoned peeta katniss is now living in district num and refusing to be the rebels mockingjay it takes peeta calling for an end to the resistance for her to finally agree to be the mockingjay and calls for immunity for her fellow tributes when they are rescued once she has finally come to the decision president coin puts her to work and katniss is sent to district num to visit with the w
1211,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,i was so excited to go to my local bookstore s midnight release party for mockingjay i hadn t been to a midnight release party for quite awhile and it s such a singular experience wandering the aisles and just soaking up the high pitched excitement and general camaraderie in the air and this time i got to do it all with my always up for a good time sister liza and the lovely holly from book harbinger together the three of us admired the radical capitol hairstyles watched the archery contest
1212,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,going into this book i was very much aware that reader opinion about it was deeply divided and had picked up bits and pieces of partial spoilers though not enough for me to predict exactly how events would turn out within my own friend circle ratings ranged from five stars to one with some people praising the novel to the skies and others feeling that collins dropped the ball badly having now read it and made my own call i have to agree that she did drop the ball big time but my reas
1214,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,mockingjay by suzanne collins is the third and final book in her hugely popular hunger games trilogy note this review contains spoilers for all three books so if you haven t read the books you might not want to read this review katniss everdeen survived the brutal hunger games not once but twice but katniss is weary and heartsick for so many reasons peeta the boy who helped her through the games is being held hostage by the capitol her home district was firebombed to ashes by the capi
1215,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,this is a book that not only holds up on a second reading but also absolutely deserves a reread the week before mockingjay was released in num i called around to different bookstores trying to find one that was having a midnight release when all ten chain and indie stores said they weren t having one i called back from a private number and with an eliza doolittle meets mary poppins accent asked if they were willing to sell me a copy one day in advance if i paid double i know i have zero
1216,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,i had heard from others without giving away any of the plot that the ending of the trilogy was unsatisfying so i braced myself for something that would disappoint me or make me mad there was one part that had me pretty upset but that was part of the twist in the story that i never saw coming that doesn t mean i was happy about it or that i wished the author would have made it more of a happier outcome however ultimately i found that i was at peace like katniss about the ending though
1217,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,2,i gave this num stars instead of num because of the other books i think the others are amazing but i found that this one while true to the reality of war altered the true nature of so many characters the story was drawn out the real arc of the climax was just before the end and the end was down right horrible yeah i didn t expect flowers and bon bons but i didn t expect her to start the series off by having katniss saving her sister by sacrificing herself only to see prim blown up at the en
1218,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,1,chapter x chapter on my blog this wasn t a book about a girl becoming an inspiring figure for her people and fighting against an oppressive regime this was a story about a girl getting yanked here and there taking no initiative over her own life and letting other people dress her up in pretty clothes and then tell her where to go also wars are impressive morally right or wrong they still make for epic stories the media people who get down and dirty in wars to document it are in impressi

1220,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,real or not real definitely real really really real and epic this book exceeded all of my expectations for a numrd book in a series what an excellent way to end a trilogy it was an emotional ride there are absolutely no words to describe how i felt while i was reading this book the floor is littered with tissues my eyes are red and puffy i am drained yet i am satisfied and happy with the outcome suzanne collins – you are a masterful author you crafted a wonderfully dark book about a w
1221,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,why oh why do authors so love to play with my emotions i m a very sensitive being i tell you 😭 in any case mockingjay was absolutely gorgeous it was the perfect ending to the trilogy with just as much action as the last two installments i haven t seen a endling this perfect since the death cure and that s saying something 
1222,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,ending was rushed audiobook comments read by carolyn mccormick and she absolutely nailed this audio loved listening to this series blog | instagram | twitter
1224,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,i must say one thing it definitely wasn t as good as i thought it d be i mean i cried once so i suppose that shows that i had some emotional attachment linked to this book but that s pretty much it if you re wondering i cried when finnick died and the lack of mention of this character after his demise is probably what at least knocked half a star off this review i guess the only reason i m writing this is because i need to vent and i have no one to talk to because either i read ver
1226,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,this was a long painful ride filled with sorrow and adventure i can t believe that i have finally read this series after so long i feel like i accomplished something huge i finally finished one of the trilogies that i am guilty about not reading it was not one of those fluffy happy books but more of a powerful and epic book it had so many parts where i cried a few times when i laughed but mostly i was crying if you haven t heard about this book it is the third book in the hunger game
1227,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,i think i can talk about this now this book exists entirely in emotional textures for me it’s like how a song can become so closely entwined with emotional response so you don’t know what is coming from the music and what is welling up from that breathless perfect moment you first heard it this is always going to be the book i was reading when my girlfriend got her cancer diagnosis i don’t have a lot of my usual tools here is what i’m saying so okay things i love i love the way this book
1228,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,this review contains some spoilers over the past eight days or so i’ve been involved in a hunger games audiobook marathon i finished listening to the last installment this afternoon and i’ve been torn between waiting for the book to settle in my head and wanting to write a review while my impressions remain strong the second option has won out i don’t know what i expected from this book but whatever it was i’ve not been disappointed this is not a fairy tale where good conquers evil and ever
1229,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,i m waffling on a rating for now num num/num stars because i m mad but that could change tomorrow lol well dam i m feeling a bit i don t know dishelveled distraught discomfuckingbobulated i m mad i know that much i do have to give kuddos to collins though she didn t pull any punches if you were hoping for delicious coffee light and sweet all your gonna get is dark black and bitter i saw the climax coming with coin but there were more than a few surprises the deaths at one point in
1231,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,“you love me real or not real i tell him real ” i know that some people don t particularly like mockingjay but i loved it was it as good as catching fire nope was it still good yes what i really loved about this book was the fact that we got to see katniss s fragile state in my opinion it was realistic that girl is still a teenager and she went through so much you can t expect her to not have ptsd after winning one hunger game and having to go through another katniss everdeen is
1232,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,num num stars my least favorite out of all three but i love the epilogue so much the last line is so haunting

1234,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,2,i m really torn on what to rate this book i went back and forth between num and num stars a few times but i ended up going with num stars for a variety of reasons that i hope i ll be able to convey i don t think that it was terrible i was disappointed and irritated by quite a lot of it i will try not to spoil the plot but if you haven t read the book read the following at your own risk first things first in the hunger games and catching fire i cared about katniss and gale and peeta they we
1235,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,mocking jay has a lot more in common with num than it does harry potter if you read this book without that in mind you’re missing the key element of the trilogy that marks it as classic finally after all the waiting my desire for serious political commentary is met and i am left with the sickening fear and tension of high stakes reality yes orwell collins understands the general review is now over only proceed if you’ve read the book or like spoilers “it’s a republic ma’am if you ca
1237,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,i had posted a fairly long review but now that i casually checked turns out gr ate it and it isn t shown anyway to sum up the long review in one phrase the book is more flawed than the previous two and the flaws worldbuilding and handling of the conclusion to the saga do take away from mockingjay yes but not to the extent it ruins the trilogy as far as i m concerned 
1238,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,2,so then this is it this is where i wave goodbye to my young adulthood time to gather my things and move on i have learnt its forthcoming wisdoms i ve been awakened but allowed to snooze i have been jolted rather than shocked i have wept saltless tears and laughed silent smiles i have learnt of love and death of governments and dreams of friendship and betrayal of fate and choice one last wave one look back no regrets no more bacardi breezers that coat the stuff that really hits yo
1240,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,3,more of my reviews can be found at flipping through the pages when i finished this book i felt drained and i felt tired okay so i was pleased with the fact that i had this patiently waiting to be read in my bookshelf right after i finished catching fire the first two books i loved they bought out so much emotion in me and hooked me into katniss world straight away but with this one i don t know i still absolutely loved it and i ll definitely reread it in the near future but it just di
1241,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,the final book of the trilogy is so intense complex packed with actions and emotions heart touching heartbreaking and near to heart “it takes ten times as long to put yourself back together as it does to fall apart ” katiness development is one hella treat to watch from a simple girl who hunts to survive to a rebel her choices her actions and emotions are so relatable and close to reality she is one of the examples that it doesn’t matter how many people you have killed in certain situatio
1242,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,2,review also published at my bookshelf is ready wow this book was hard to get through not because of all the violent character deaths but because there was something so dull about the novel i m not kidding when i say that mockingjay read like a piece of fan fiction it is written in the author s tone but there is that certain something missing here that was present back in the hunger games but truthfully started waning in catching fire before it righted itself toward the end of the sequel m
1243,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,1,num the narrator mentions cheese buns in reference to something from the past books that she shares in common with peeta i thought it was cheese bread in the other books the bakerboy makes cheese breads which the main character likes cheese buns sounds borderline kinky and suggestive num the unit is number num so trite this is obviously a reference to ray bradbury s fahrenheit num or the temperature at which books burn maybe like the temperature this book should be burned num pane
1244,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4,my wife told me i flew through this series by most accounts i wouldn’t consider myself a speed reader but i can certainly dedicate the time to read a good book or in this case a great series and after finishing the hunger games trilogy i can honestly say this series has it all the characters the setting action scenes galore great dialogue and we lived in katniss’s head for the entire three book ordeal what a fresh wonderful character who wouldn’t take crap from anyone view spoile
1245,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,5,a brilliant heart wrenching fictional account about the horrific psychological implications of war ms collins third installment of her hunger games series gives us something the first two books only hinted at the deep scars left behind by a society in love with violence forget team peeta/team gale by the end of this book you are only team humanity i was up till num num a m finishing up katniss heroes journey and i doubt i ll be as emotionally affected by another novel anytime soon it is now

1258,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3, reread in num just because this book introduces the reader to what i consider a sort of proto valdemar it s the author s first book of the series her first novel entirely if i remember correctly and after having read some of her later works i can say that it shows it s not quite as polished and refined as what she writes later on down the road but the seeds of an expansive world are sown here and it s interesting to see it isn t very action heavy so those looking to this as a sword and
1259,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,i absolutely adored this book i wanted to give it five stars but how can i when i m so effing mad that view spoiler [talia won t end up with skif i know that dirk saw her first and that usually is a good indicator of who the real love interest is but still skif spent so much time with talia was a more developed character i feel like dirk just suddenly appeared out of nowhere he doesn t get any page time until the end and i am going to admit i m pretty shallow when it comes to the hero
1260,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,this was the first valdemar book that i read which was sort of fortuitous since it was the first book about the world that mercedes lackey wrote it isn t my favorite kero s tale has that honor but it comes very very close i re read this book and the rest of the trilogy probably about once a year and i never get tired of them don t be fooled by the childish looking covers this trilogy deals with some very adult themes child abuse death torture sex war rape murder but it does i

1263,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,2,my partner has been working on a fantasy world for a while now and one of these days he might actually put all of his scraps of paper together into a cohesive story i love this and i keep urging him to keep at it one of the ways i encourage him is to ask him about his world which then sets him off on an hour long discussion about some very important yet seemingly small details about something that happened in this world a thousand years ago we got to talking about his main character a femal
1264,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,what fun it is to revisit an old time favorite and enjoy it just as much as ever 
1265,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,solid feel good fantasy about a young woman coming of age strongly reminiscent of alanna the first adventure and dragonsinger for me 
1266,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,2,ugh what get outta here 
1267,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,1,oh my god this book was so fucking stupid i can t believe i finished it i ve been on a streak of bad books lately but this one takes the cake arrows of the queen has absolutely no plot no plot points no character development no climax and overall nothing good about it i am not even over exaggerating here s what happens in the story talia gets welcomed into a royal castle and becomes a part of the queen s army she then goes to classes every day and talks to people inside the castle s g
1269,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,num num/num stars arrows of the queen was a light little fantasy read that i truly wish i had picked up when i was younger it was exactly the sort of story i used to day dream about this is no mind blowing piece of work but it definitely had enough to keep me enchanted despite its many clichés this was also very clearly a set up book and i have faith that the rest of the series and works of lackey improve in writing and in plot probably my least favorite part about this book were how many chara
1270,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,2,talia wants one thing in life and that s to become a herald and ride their magic horses like in the stories she reads but she lives in a village where virtually everything is forbidden to women when she is announced to be married at the young age of num she panics flees and miraculously comes upon a magical white horse in the forest who whisks her away to become the very thing she s dreamed of although she doesn t realize it just yet after arriving at the collegium she trains for the next num
1271,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,when i was younger i would say in my early teens my friends read all of the mercedes lackey books they could get their eyes on because i didn t listen to audio books at the time— i only read braille when i could be bothered to read that is i didn t get to read these books and what a series i missed but i m catching up now and am delighted to do so the nls annotation is below talia lives on the borders of the kingdom in an isolated grim hold she knows little about the outside world except
1272,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,actually this book is better than a num but it s not really a num it s a well written book about a are you ready young hero who s miserable abused and unappreciated at home until duh duh duh duh duh duh duh daaaaa one of the chosen yes gasp she s to be a herald so you get the picture the young protagonist who s had a hard to miserable childhood/youth and then gets called away to be a hero/heroine still my sense of humor aside it s a well written book and the young protagonis
1273,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,num num stars talia has never fitted into her home she dream of adventures and not the bland drudgery and abuse that she lives with when she realises the future planned for her by those in her household she blindly runs only to found by a companion the fabled steeds of the heralds who serve the queen as messengers and warriors not wanting to go back to her home talia decides to take the companion back to the queen and see where fate may take her this is the first mercedes lackey book i have read
1274,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,1,i would give this a num num if i could because i did enjoy the beginning of this book if nothing else i was sorely disappointed with this book as i am a fan of mercedes lackey s other books this novel seemed rushed as if the only reason for it was to set the scene for the next novel in the series the beginning seemed promising i was truly interested in following this girl s journey however it quickly degenerated into something barely readable much of this girl s life was glossed over when
1275,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,today this book gets dumped into the ya category which is probably wrong ya is a relatively new definition and at least to me refers to a much older age category this books target audience seems to be young teen or even pre teen if i wwere a real young adult and somebody gave me this book and said this book s for you i would feel pretty insulted that aside it s not a bad book it s all very sparkly goody goody fun but reading it as an adult i kept feeling that there was going to be a
1276,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,quite obviously a first book it reminded me a bit of pern i really enjoyed it though i recognize its faults and that it was kind of simple it reminded me of why i love fantasy and what got me into the genre to begin with i only wish i found it earlier i m going to read the next two books in the trilogy maybe i ll write something more in depth later but this is mostly it while i m on the ipad one thing i found interesting was that this book didn t have the traditional story arc that i 
1277,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,this book put me in pigtails i read this with the joy of finally getting around to a mercedes lackey title her two rolls of novels on the library shelve was extremely intimidating and a barrier from my adding her to my tbr pile but it is good to show some love to a writer who wrote in such a timely manner as opposed to the latest tend of a book every five or seven year the book had a nice pace taking a young girl from a bad situation to a magical place with a super powered horse it sound
1278,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,i absolutely adored all of lackey s valdemar novels when i was an adolescent but a lot of them are a little too emo for me now i still truly enjoy her first trilogy the arrows of the queen despite the fact that it shows lackey s inexperience i often feel that an author s first book is frequently his or her best and i believe this to be true of lackey talia and dirk were always my favorite characters in all of lackey s books and this trilogy is the only series they are featured in they b
1279,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,really solid fantasy story the overall concept of and world building were nice for such a short story it really felt like lackey packed in a ton without it feeling too info dumpy or rushed i thought the best part of the story was talia which can be rare ish with fantasy stories for me main characters in fantasy are sometimes really uninteresting they tend to blur together talia was great though such a distinct character which i always always always appreciate she wasn t the usual fie
1280,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,i really enjoyed this book don t get me wrong we don t get the most intricate world the dialogue is often flat descriptions really show rather than tell but arrows the queen basically fulfills all of my girlish childhood fantasies to be the savior of a kingdom fated for something great earn love and respect from your peers and have a magical bonded horse to boot sign me up this and the fact that mercedes lackey was also way ahead of her time for the nums go girls made this s
1281,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,1,arrows of the queen was newly available on hoopla and i d never read any lackey so i thought i d give it a shot this is the sort of book my sister would have loved when she was a teenager a perfect and misunderstood num year old a school that accepts her and horsies it s a thin plot about horses that have some sort of ancient personalities and they attach to humans and they re trying to stop evil machinations that all happen off stage it s so lightweight and what s also lightweight
1282,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,so the thing about re reading a beloved favorite book for the first time in let s be honest almost a decade ugg how am i old enough to write that sentence is that sometimes they re not quite as good as your remember i read arrows of the queen for the first time my freshman year of high school and promptly gave my copy to the bf who was the one who bought the copies of the books i m now reading fourteen years later full circle baby oh dear it s going to be one of those reviews i s
1283,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,another blanket review this one for all arrows books the rating is from my num year old self and she emphatically recommends them to all num year old girls who lean toward fantasy being a horse crazy preteen i was of course all about these first valdemar books insanely so they re far more accessible than the pern books the language isn t as stilted or formal the plotlines aren t utterly simplistic but neither are they so convoluted as to be impenetrable to a num year old the characte
1284,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,i love it the characters are so very likeable the companions are just awesome and the story is very engrossing and i could easily get lost in it i really love the idea of the companions and that they choose someone and from what i gathered often saved their heralds from dire situations while doing so and basically give them a second chance for having a good life yes heralds have a dangerous life and often die young as we see in this book sobs but compared to their old lives and ju
1285,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,num num stars if you are a fan of fantasy this is a good comfort read lots of likeable characters intrigue magic horses what s not to like i didn t upgrade it to num stars because it didn t seem very original for example mistreated teen turns out to be the chosen one and because there weren t really any twists everything was pretty straightforward and was wrapped up neatly at the end however these same qualities contribute to its being what i call a good comfort read i ll probably rea
1286,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,this was the very first book of her s that i ever read and it has changed my life there s no other way to describe the impact this book has had on me since reading this book i have discovered a world that has taken me places i have never dreamed of arrow s of the queen introduced the world of valdemar to me and many other worlds since then i have read the entire valdemar series dozens of times and each time it s like reading a new book all over again i find new things to love about it eac
1287,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,this book was my first fantasy read since harry potter it painted an amazing picture that had elements of magic but not so much that it made the plotline unbelievable talya s transformation from quiet shy adolescent child too confident young woman was not only believable but extraordinary magic came in the form of magical horses which was very appealing to me as i was horse crazy since i was a young kid this book left you in a state of wonder as to what may happen next i can t wait to see
1288,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,typical sort of young adolescent who has a tough life and cruel family discovers they have a special gift and is whisked away to become some sort of special mage/wizard/healer/warrior book but certainly enjoyable and i like having a young girl be the protagonist it was compelling enough that i continued to the sequels and i would revisit the universe when i have time edit first read in num re read april num and enjoyed it just as much despite having well worn tropes they get reused bec
1289,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,so this is where it all started with talia while not my favourite off shoot from the heralds of valdemar i still enjoyed learning about talia this book includes the usual intrigue and overcoming obstacles 
1290,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,i really enjoyed this book the reason i gave it only num stars is that sometimes the writing and the story are a little too simple and you can tell the writer is inexperienced that and the huge cliche of the small miserable child who gets chosen for a grand destiny 
1291,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,num stars where has this book been all my life seriously i have a paperback copy somewhere in the basement that i never read which was purchased long long ago since i read almost exclusively in digital now there was little chance that i would go digging through boxes of books for the paper copy but then the library added a digital copy to their collection i checked it out on a whim and had a very fun journey with talia and rolan this book reminded me of harry potter in both tone and t
1292,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,reading an old favorite book again after some years is always a risky proposition i admit that i was a bit apprehensive when i started listening to the audiobook would i hate it now would i find talia too much of a mary sue to be endured i loved this book and this series so much and it added a great deal to my personal and spiritual growth in my younger days looking at it now i have to admit that talia is just a bit too perfect in this first book lackey learned a lot from this series and
1293,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,not a bad story but nothing outstanding i was enamored with it as with most valdemar stories when i first read it years ago as one of my first fantasy stories now decades later with hundreds of other fantasy stories behind me not so much i like the heroine talia i sympathize with her self doubts and her reticence and her desperate attempts to fit in the first part of the book was actually pretty good unfortunately when the second part rolled in the protagonist suddenly changed 
1294,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,revisiting this story like an old friend i was pleased to be reminded how much of the series is foreshadowed here not only is vanyel s story the historic tale that inspires talia in her dreams of heraldry but albrecht s life and the tedrel wars are both very present as immediate influences on the events of this first novel the arc of not only talia s story but elspeth s is hinted at here and i wonder how much lackey knew even in this first book about the world of valdemar in a way this is
1295,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,an utterly delightful ya novel about what i ve come to think of as the standard trope a sad young girl discovers that she has a magical pet that loves her best and her whole life changes and yet all tropes have origins and just as no one could accuse tolkien of being derivative just so can no one accuse lackey because i m fairly sure she is one of the inventors of this particular sub genre the fact that the story normalizes gay relationships too is a nice bonus i kept being surprised it
1296,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,i did find the story rather too contrived and frankly a bit maudlin in places there was little action and apart from the main protagonist the characters would have benefited from more depth although it wasn t awful i think i m probably a little too old now for this particular series so i probably won t bother with the rest 
1297,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,i tend to love mercedes lackey so i wasn t surprised to like this one one of the complaints i generally have for her though is that she tends to go over such vast time spans so quickly and that characters tend to develop bonds so quickly that you don t really get to see the how/why still i thought that this was a good read and i m excited to move forward with the series 
1298,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,i was looking for a fantasy book that didn t involve war for a change and here was the perfect one i felt the pace was a bit fast and there was some episodes within the book that were glossed over so i found it a little hard to really get to know the characters other than that though i enjoyed it and num year old me is gutted i didn t read it back then 
1299,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,this is a real classic fantasy series one of the earliest i remember reading and it really holds up sensational in its gay rep for the time period too this was the first valdemar book i read and i will always have emotional attachment to it even if i think the magic s pawn/price/promise ones are actually better 
1300,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,probably my biggest complaint of this book is the way time passes months go by with a few words this just over num page book occurs over the span of num num years the characters mature well throughout this time but reading it and suddenly thinking “wait how much time has passed ” wasn’t the most enjoyable also can’t believe the bury your gays trope existed in num smh
1301,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,that was fun i was a little surprised that the companion didn’t have much of a role but i’m excited to read the rest of these 
1302,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,genre epic fantasy terry brooks robert jordan david eddings and other popular male authors where about it for epic fantasy exposure when i was first starting out in the genre so it came as a shock when the allure of a female voice was so addicting after being bombarded with male writing—in fact lackey was the first female ef author i had ever read back when   it was a shock to read a book that actually had emotions and plots that worked with them   of course the idea of mystical horses that
1303,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,so after a week spent reading patrick rothfuss i felt a longing for the fantasy i choose for myself as a teenager it wasn t this book but owlflight and brightly burning that drew me in and refused to let go but like many series in outdated country libraries they didn t have all the books maybe they did at some point but over the years theft and use had dwindled the collection down to a few titles it is with great shame that in my adulthood i haven t hunted more of these down now i have
1304,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,2,i was really torn between two and three stars i remember loving this book in high school and really connecting with talia i remember feeling very intrigued by empathy being a gift even after figuring out that i wasn t as into mercedes lackey anymore this book still held a special place in my heart so you can imagine that i was incredibly disappointed with this read through i remember having certain thoughts when i was younger why didn t i know that cheryl was into keren until i suddenly
1305,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,magic horses guys i really love the valdemar books they are a little bit fluffy and wish fullfillment y but they are a lot of fun and oddly progressive in a lot of ways valdemar is kind of the perfect fantasy kingdom in a lot of ways with a monarchy but a monarchy run by people who are guaranteed to be good people at least even if it doesn t always promise that they will be good rulers talia is an easy heroine to like she starts in an awful family situation that does not suit her at al

1309,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,man i am just finding all kinds of nostalgia books tonight this is another one of my favorites from yesteryear i used to be a huge mercedes lackey fan i probably have read just about all of her valdemar books at least the ones that were published before i was num or num i still remember finding owlflight at the public library and being completely enchanted and just plowing through trilogy after trilogy this trilogy though was always my favorite followed in close second by the winds tr
1310,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,adolescent female wish fulfillment ftw just to get it out of the way this book is not well written it s chock full of telling not showing and extraneous adverbs it lacks narrative structure our heroine is unbelievably gifted and also under appreciated in that way that adolescent readers really relate to except not really because everyone loves the living crap out of her she just doesn t realize it its lack of technical proficiency is actually kind of endearing in that it reminds me o
1311,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,1,this book was on my receipt with recommendations i got after purchasing the latest in britain s green rider series for me to write a review on how bad a book was that has never happened until now i think abigail below reviews hit the nail on the head it was a poorly written book with almost no plot i kept waiting for there to be a point to the story i feel like maybe this book strayed to far from original idea i was under the impression it was all about taming the queen s bratty chil

1314,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,oh dear arrows of the queen is such an adolescent novel not a young adult novel i m not talking about category here i m talking about the maturity level of the work compared to the rest of the valdemar canon even the vanyel books are light years ahead of this charming but dreadfully slight exercise in wish fulfillment i don t think it s bad mind you talia is adorable except when she s thinking things like well i know this trustworthy adult said they d help but i don t want to be a
1315,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,i found this book to be a let down as well as a bit confusing i never really solidified in my mind who was who and that really took me out of the book i found a lot of similarities to alanna but without the special magic that alanna has still this was an interesting read and i ll probably continue the series the first chapter of the book really turned me off initially because it seemed like it too similar to a religion that i dislike and don t agree with thankfully by the second or so chapter
1316,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,so my sister is called talia and it was more than a little weird to read a book where they mention her name like every other sentence i d constantly be like wait no this isn t my talia who is this what is going on but i got used to it after about num pages but it still kept pulling me out of the story heh but oh man besides that i love this world building holy crap lackey also acknowledges trauma and mental hurt from abusive families and the long term effect it can have on children man
1317,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,i started reading this book in numth grade my english teacher had a free read portion of every class and i had either just finished a book or forgotten one so i picked this one up off of a bookshelf in the classroom for people like me did not have something to read i read pretty fast and this book totally hooked me i probably got num num chapters in by the time the bell rang she did not let us check out the books from her classroom so i wrongly fully expected this book to be waiting for me the n
1318,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,a coming of age story that reads for the most part as if it s written for pre teens not like a lot of mercedes lackey s fantasy novels which tend to be very overwritten and with lots of angst between the lovelorn and generally doomed characters this one s more lively about a num year old girl from a very misogynistic and insular society who is chosen by one of the intelligent horses known as companions and undergoes training in the very important role of queen s own herald yes all those t
1319,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,i’m not sure how many times i’ve read this over the years but i wouldn’t be surprised if it was a half dozen or more which made it the perfect comfort read after finishing two years of assigned reading this book got me through junior high and i love it just as much now as i did then i m adding this section just to bulk up the why i like it part of my review i don t want to examine my love of this book too closely for fear that i ll lose some of the shine but if you re considering
1320,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,this review has been crossposted from my blog at the cosy dragon please head there for more in depth reviews by me which appear on a timely schedule talia has been freshly chosen but she doesn t understand what that means thrown into the dangerous world of the court of queen selenay she must find her feet quickly or drown in the doing so talia is one of the strong female heroines that makes lackey s writing so powerful for me her shaky beginnings only make her better in my eyes and her l
1321,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,i just finished reading this about ten minutes ago it took me less than a day to read and i have to say it was very well worth it i came rather late to the whole heralds book thing arrows of the queen being the first one i ve read and it was published twenty five years ago i remember all my friends reading books either from this series or any of the other half dozen or so series of books that mercedes lackey wrote that were based in the same world and they do seem to be the sort of story i
1322,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,recommended for preteens obsessed with horses emotionally troubled teenagers i have been rereading some of the books i read as a kid but have completely forgotten after being bonked on the head as i read the first half of the book all i could think was wow this lady knows exactly what she is doing it is perfectly written to appeal to a lonely child as an adult i know that relationships derive their meaning in part from the time we put into them a lonely child however will latch on
1323,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,authors first books are often not very good thankfully mercedes lackey s first book is not actually bad arrows of the queen is readable if often slow and almost completely lacking in plot the ending surprised me because well there wasn t one i wouldn t recommend reading this book for its own sake but if you re interested in the heralds of valdermar series and you want to start from the beginning go for it just know that later books although similar are better don t let this rough
1324,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,pretty darn good it seems there are a number of fantasy series out there that start with a young girl growing up in an abused/repressed situation she dreams of something bigger some talent/ability is discovered in her she gets the appropriate training and her dreams come true to some extent the thing i appreciate about this one is that the young girl does not unrealistically blossom as soon as she leaves home she has scars from her past that take time to overcome i like that the author d
1325,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,2,i was underwhelmed by this book it wasn t really bad i just think i read it at the wrong time if i had read it as a teenager i m sure i would have loved it the story itself is pretty good i like the world and the characters but the way talia s trials were written bothered me it all felt so staged like everything was going so well for talia but there needed to be some roadblocks for a good story so one gets thrown in but there s a magical gift wrapped solution just waiting in the wing
1326,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,i gave this a num stars from memory as i read it years ago i found it to be an easy re read and if this were published today it would probably be classed as ya it does have something of the ya fantasy novels of today with a bit of vague sexual reference but no actual described acts it is like a children s book in that the story revolves around a mythical country ruled by a queen and served by heralds the heralds have magical gifts and a companion which looks like a glowing white horse even wit
1327,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,this is one of my favorite books and i ve read it so many times it s started falling apart growing up i had a hard life and talia s story being carried off by a magical creature away from her horrible family and into a new life and a grand adventure struck a chord in me i completely empathized with her character at first talia starts off as shy quiet and does her best to stay in the background but she gradually grows to be more confident in herself and in her abilities in the next tw
1328,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,this was a decent fantasy type book where a girl who doesn t fit the norm of her people s customs because she likes to read and doesn t want to marry at the age of num escapes and discovers her real talents and her magical purpose in life the book was easy for me to pick up and read at anytime the main character was a little too self deprecating at points but the main theme of the story i guess is the main character learning that she is a valued and valuable person all in all i liked th

1330,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,this isn t a perfect book reading it as an adult i see plenty of flaws it reads very much as a debut novel and yet i don t care one bit i read it for the first time when i was in fifth grade i was a weird brunette bookish outsider for a farm town i wanted to have adventures and do important things and find somewhere to fit in i have never fallen for a story as hard as i fell for talia s i have never identified with a character as much as i did with talia back in middle school i don t
1331,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,2,ok this is a wish fulfillment fantasy beach read it will not foster your intellectual growth it will not stretch you as a person it is about a teenage girl who is treated horribly by her family because no teenage girl ever feels that way i m sure escapes them and is promptly discovered to be an important person and gets pretty much everything she wants including the pony and the pony can talk but you know we all have had days and even weeks lousy enough that a little adolescent wish
1332,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,this is one of those books that i wish i d stumbled on when i was a kid it s pure simple fantasy you can tell that this is early in mercedes lackey s career as the writing quality leaves some things to be desired but the premise is strong and i m curious to learn more about the world of valdemar talia is an endearing but somewhat flat character although it s nice to see a female rags to riches lead who isn t a princess tropes abound in this book but it was still a fun look back at the f
1333,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,this was not my first mercedes lackey book but talia has been incorporated into later books so i went back and read this series like i would have left some lackey books unread i get just as caught up in this now as i did when i was a teenager love hate revenge death true love no giants but there is magic and talking sort of horses although the main character is a young girl when this book begin she never gets the whiny teenage voice some authors like to use but instead remains i
1334,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,just reread this for comfort my taste for mercedes lackey is a funny thing it was born out of elements from her earlier books the tormented young protagonists the horses the general goodness of her people except for the ones who are bad who are then thoroughly bad but it is not due to her fantastic writing ability because while lackey can put together a plot and clearly is prolific there is nothing noteworthy about her style i do not admire her turns of phrase i just wrap their
1335,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,one of my favourite books of all time and just as good today as it was when i first read it more than twenty years ago this book takes what could be cliched fantasy elements and weaves them into a perfectly paced plot and characters you desperately care about the balance between feel good adventure and grim occasionally tragic realism is masterful anyone who s read the following books will also appreciate the many moments of foreshadowing 
1336,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,imagine harry potter for a slightly older crowd young adolescents receiving magical training as part of their overall training as heralds the herald system is a good one designed to ensure that heralds play fair despite their power magical and otherwise in a world where the powerful often misuse their power it s heartwarming to see a whole community of people trying and often succeeding to do good 
1337,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,i always forgot in the haze of delighted nostalgia how cheesy the writing is in this and oh jeez the dialogue nobody talks in paragraphs pretty sure i can directly blame this trilogy for my terrible writing throughout all of my teenage years but with that said talia was so formative for me that i can t pick this up without immediately being engrossed fully immersed in her world this will always be one of my two favorite valdemar series 
1338,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,i know this book is mildly cheesy and that talia is the mary sue to end all mary sues i know this but i can t help but adore these books with all my tiny stone cold heart and soul anyway re read may num holy typographical errors batman whoever edited my version of this book was asleep on the job i found so many errors spelling errors continuity errors typos it was appalling and it gave me hope that someday i will be an awesome editor 
1339,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,it s not deathless prose but it doesn t have to be i remember what it was like to be a depressed frustrated unpopular book crazy horse crazy teenager and how this book connected with all those emotions when i settled back to read it one stormy summer afternoon every so often i go back just for old times sake and it s like reuniting with an old lover you ve outgrown but still care about deeply 
1340,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,reread with tor com i wasn t sure how many chapters i was supposed to read for the read along and in the end i just kept on going until i was finished ooops it s not a complex or complicated book but it s still a lovely read and to be honest i enjoyed it more than i expected to lots of fun 
1341,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,well written positive story the author makes the fantasy elements seem quite believable and normal and the author is able to weave a tale in a way that keeps moving and keeps you rooting for the characters it s nice to read stories about people i would enjoy spending some time with reinforcing values of frienship loyalty love trust hard work that has value i ll be reading more
1342,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,a fun read for a fantasy fan it follows a very classic formula but has a vibrant world to make it all come to life talia is a fun main character and you enjoy cheering her on i enjoyed this story and will read it again in the future 
1343,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,initial thoughts review this book reminded me so much of tamora pierce s stories i grew up reading them over and over again so my rating may have more to do with nostalgia than anything else i can t wait to pass this title along to other pierce fans 
1344,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,excellent intro to valdemar proper the first in the debut trilogy about the heralds and their companions fun light romantic fantasy with canon lesbian character which is nice to see this was a reread 
1345,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,i m continuing my mercedes lackey readinghistory with this one which was my gateway drug to all of her books i really loved talia s story which felt groundbreaking back then i still have deep affection for this one though i loved the later books much better

1347,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,2,great world building is marred by choppy and uneven story telling talia is not compelling enough of a heroine for me to continue with the series 
1348,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,probably my very favorite sci fi/fantasy world in literature i love them all and have to re read all the haven/valdemar books every num num years or so

1358,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,this is a little gem of a book brilliantly written and so easy to get into 
1359,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,i found this book quaint at first it s a story about a girl who doesn t want to do girl things and wants to go on adventures like the ones she reads in books she s chosen by fate in this case roland a horse deity to go to a magical school that s much more like home than her actual home was and finds out that she was chosen to help the queen bring harmony to the kingdom she learns how to be a herald and helps uncover a plot to overthrow the queen so far so trite right but arrows of the

1362,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,2,our yack book for june chosen by laura who wanted to give us something nostalgic and lovely unfortunately arrows of the queen was neither for me i’ve only been introduced to lackey’s writing within the last num years and so far it’s been num for num with her books i’ve read the fairy godmother and hunter both from newer series and i dnfed the former and didn’t like the latter this one wasn’t really much different i just don’t like her writing style that’s really what it boils down to her wri
1363,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,1,i started to read this because the trilogy was cheap on kindle and i haven t tried this author before though i know she s very prolific i ll concede that it was probably a mistake because i ve just finished robin hobbs entire elderlings series all num books and few if any fantasy works can be expected to match that however here we go this is mercedes lackey s first book and it really shows about all you can say is that there are no obvious mistakes in spelling or grammar otherwise i rea
1364,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,this is very much the beginning of a series set within the collegium just like talia you are there to learn this is not a bad thing her classes and instructors are all quite enjoyable the worldbuilding is fine wherein we are taught magic battles intrigue and monsters exist but experience little of it firsthand more importantly i feel is the character development the book examines child abuse brilliantly through the lens of recovery i loved that the collegium allowed talia an extend
1365,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,2,wasn t my cup of tea i suppose i m sure the series gets more refined in the future works but i m unsure i can stomach the number of texts required to get to said point there were events within that were just so far out of the range of reality that it took me out of the story now you may be thinking well derp this is a text about a mystical horse and the knights who ride them i mean there isn t much of reality you can get from that but i say there has to be something based on truth in
1366,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,i read the obsidian trilogy by lackey and james mallory a month or so ago and enjoyed that series very little i was wary to pick up another lackey book however her valdemar books came highly recommended and i can see why this book was infinitely more enjoyable the writing style was completely different from what i expected it was practical almost simple but with an irresistible pull that kept the pages turning i personally appreciated the pace and flow of the book how it never felt bo
1367,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,i m so happy to have finally read about talia and her first book of adventures a shy gifted teenager who dreams of becoming a herald hides from her family one day as they don t understand her and expect her to get married at only num a beautiful stallion who mindspeaks his name as rolan comes into her life one day and changes it forever soon talia is living the life she s only read about in stories and excels at her classes she finds herself bullied by a group of unknown people who make her li
1368,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,num num finished it but skimmed parts there are no really developed characters this book reminds me of a worse executed the blue sword / mckinley books in general in that it creates a lovely warm setting but has no urgency and hence agency for the protagonist it s an extended training sequence talia is good at everything and everyone loves her and i m not someone to complain about mary sues normally the only real conflict is the conspiracy against the queen which is resolved around t
1369,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,arrows of the queen is a typical ya high fantasy adventure novel that uses tropes like training schools communication/bonding with animals and some measure of courtly intrigue in the vein of green rider and pierce s tortall series the alanna the first adventure wild magic and first test quartets come to mind especially centering on a young girl named talia a misfit living in mormon like community the story truly begins when a strange horse one of the famous companions of the heralds 
1370,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,2,i really want to like this book i really do the world it creates is breathtaking the concept of heralds/companions is immediately enticing and the entire culture of the book makes you feel warm and happy inside however i could not get over the sloppy writing style it felt like one long exposition the time and perspective jumps are jumbled and confusing the characters are very one dimensional and the conflicts are too hastily resolved in fact the main character for all her importance
1371,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,1,i read this book along time ago and was so thoroughly unimpressed that it stuck with me for over a decade the plot was anemic the characters unmemorable and flat the stakes low and the conflict flat spoilers there is almost nothing that i remember about the plot or story except for the part where lackey sets up a romance has the characters utterly fail three or four times to have sex then has them sorta shrug it off and decide then and there that are just friends on the one hand no one
1372,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,while reading this book i couldn t believe the parallels between it and harry potter even though it was published long before hp both revolve around a child who is poorly cared for then they are eventually introduced to a new world in which they are a star in some way they develop deep friendships in this new world and they face challenges never imagined loved the coincidences and appreciated the fact that it was a story revolving around a girl this time instead of a boy i also loved h
1373,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,this was the first book i ve read by this author and based on the rating amount of reviewers i expected something fantastic instead i found this to be on a children s level and i wasn t expecting that the plot was so basic and anytime anything nice and complicated could ve developed the problems just resolved themselves with practically no effort on the characters parts i enjoy children s books i love most of tamora pierce s works but i found this to be so much simpler it had al
1374,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,so i m being slightly generous in my rating here it definitely had a few debut novel problems in that information was sometimes oddly given in omniscient breaks from the main narrative something that persists even in later lackey novels though she does it much more smoothly so you hardly notice there were jarring jumps in time that made the book feel episodic with the reader skipping half a season and the plot and worldbuilding were pretty spasmodic this has the definite feel of a ya no
1375,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,reread for nostalgia i guess surprised at well it holds up i m mean it s basically teenage wish fulfillment abused girl turns out to be special and gets special magical horse too and it s kind of more episodic than an actual plot but it is essentially a bildungsroman and mostly just a lot of world building but it s a head a shoulders above the usual ya fantasy of girls discovering they are special it s not without problems most the conflict is quickly and easily resolved there s huge
1376,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,wow did i ever enjoy this i have read books of mercedes lackey before but it was years ago and i decided it was about time i started from the beginning yes there is the odd typo in the book but i am totally willing to overlook that this is the story of how talia becomes a herald after running away from her repressive family who would send the num year old off to be married she sees a companion who convinces her to get on his back as she knows nothing about how companions choose she isn t su
1377,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,talia lives in a dream world of heralds and companions eagerly searching out any of the old stories she can get her hands on her real world however is far bleaker as holderkin her role as a woman is to marry and bear younglings on her numth birthday she is told that she must marry destroyed by shock and fear talia runs to her secret hiding place in tears knowing that all her dreams will end until she comes upon a beautiful white horse and realizes that she must return him to his rig
1378,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,that was cute sweet easy read in the style i love with the themes that grab me maybe a bit too glib and easy for our heroine all hardships felt like they were dispersed easily and in terms of emotional depth while written well i didn t connect as much because the characters still seemed to lack the necessary amount of well character also most likely because i would have loved this properly were i the target age as it has the same feel as tamora pierces early books but i think what made
1379,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,so once upon a time when i was scarcely num i picked up this book and there was a num year old girl for a main character who wasn’t pretty and liked animals and reading with a conservative family that just didn’t understand her and i learned the meaning of target audience as a middle aged adult i know lackey’s books aren’t great classics of literature but there’s something to be said sometimes for a book where the brave and true will in the end triumph over evil and make things just a litt
1380,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,num num to num stars liked it it was cute will probably pick up the sequels at some point main character is quite mary sue ish everyone insta likes her she has a talent for a lot of things helps everyone out but yet stays humble of course but i guess the plot explains/accounts for that seeing as that would be the nature of a chosen so i ll let it slide i did think the narrative was a little skippish at times as in would suddenly skip to a different character perspective skip so
1381,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,there are a lot of reviews that say this could have been three books and i don t disagree per se but i certainly appreciate it for what it is if i d read this as a num year old i probably would ve re read it every month there are also a lot of reviews that say everything feels normal and acceptable except for the horse bond which makes me wonder if those readers have ever met a horse if the rest of the magic is at a level that makes sense for you the tbh horse magic is at a lower level of
1382,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,num num stars this older fantasy was on my to read list until i came across the trilogy in a used bookstore during my victoria vacation it was interesting enough that i flew through the book captivated talia is a different type of character than i am used to reading about especially with the holderkin aka communal/colony type of upbringing with abuse that bothered me a bit some viewpoints i didnt agree with and the whole common talk of sex by thirteen year olds was unusual but i loved the id
1383,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,this book was the numth of lackey s valdemar books i purchased as soon as i could after finishing the last herald mage trilogy i found arrows of the queen not to be quite as compelling as vanyel s story yet i quite enjoyed it talia is a strong character whose quirks and personality drew me in though some readers may find the concept of heralds and companions a little saccharine they are not without their challenges and difficulties these are good people overall but they do have flaws one
1384,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,what girl hasn t wanted to be rescued from some more or less desperate state and carried away on the back of a white horse for many of us it s the knight on the white horse who s the hero for talia the heroine of this book it s the horse alone mercedes lackey dispenses with the knight as why shouldn t she we don t all need or even want the knight hero we just need the vehicle and a horse of whatever color is close to the heart and dreams of many a girl no matter what her age even
1385,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,2,dnf num i had really high expectations of this one just think if i liked it i d suddenly have access to twenty or more books in an awesome universe unfortunately i couldn t even get through the book when i pick up a book i want to read a story this wasn t a story it was a whole introductory book and as such it was boring we were regaled with the history of the world but not in a seamless way it felt more like a lecture when we weren t stuck in class the whole of the actual story
1386,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,this is a classic num s fantasy trilogy featuring kingdom guardians called heralds and their magical horses thirteen year old talia escapes her family s ultra patriarchal society and their plans for her marriage by becoming chosen by one of the magical horses called companions to start training to become a herald most of the book is talia at the herald school as she deals with bullies finding friends and growing up there is not a ton of action or fighting here the focus is more on the gro
1387,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,so i ve never read any of mercedes lackey s fiction in my adolescence this is a pity probably because this book is exactly tailored to the adolescent fantasy reader i m going to be rather critical in this review so i want to preface this by making it clear that despite its many flaws arrows of the queen was quite readable and i was interested in what would come next despite its lack of much character development or a terribly involved plot this is something of a feat and i credit it as m
1388,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,mercedes lackey s first novel and my first experience with her work unless i ve read a short story by her in the past and forgot about it and it s a rather rough effort lackey created an extremely appealing setting and some likable characters but there s very little plot here arrows of the queen is more of an introduction for the setting and showing us talia s journey to becoming a harald than anything else every obstacle is temporary at worst even conspiracies against the throne and we
1389,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,num num stars one of the fundamental works of romantic fantasy this book is an amazingly easy read talia is a joyous character and the character and relationship build is fantastic this is what this type of fantasy is about characters creating bonds discovering themselves for a book written in num it was very progressive and i don t doubt it is a heavy influence of modern ya however the pacing is strange there are a lot of deus ex machina situations some of the important plot scenes a
1390,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,i seem to be reading a lot of books that don t feel like they have a central conflict but are still unified in plot arrows of the queen is better understood as a series of vignettes documenting the growth of talia into her powers and role as the queen s own it has a number of charming moments and while there are few moments where failure seems a threat it maintained my interest there s a lot of heavy handed foreshadowing so there are few surprises about anything but the characters are char
1391,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,i am excited to continue this series it was well written in my opinion with a really interesting world that i am excited to explore further and fun characters who i can t wait to learn more about talia the lead seems like a character i can relate with and i look forward to see her adventure continue also side note this feels like something tamora pierce might have used as an inspiration for alanna s world if that makes any sense i want to know if there is any proof of this does anyo
1392,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,maybe i ve been reading too much grrm but i found this book to be oddly lacking in world and character building it also felt a little cringe wish fulfillment for little girls with the best friends for life horse companions saying all that it was readable and perhaps i m no longer the target audience for this series i probably would ve enjoyed it a lot when i was num and maybe even num i guess i was left a little puzzled because i d always known mercedes lackey s name as a respected epic fanta
1393,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,talia is a child in a holderkin family and is considered to be a trouble maker when she turns num her father s wives tell her it is time for her to be married talia doesn t want to be married so she runs off to her favourite hiding place when she hears a horse on the road below her she leans out to look and falls down a bank to land at the feet of the animal then she realized it is a companion but he has no herald so talia decides to return him to his herald and thus starts a journey that ult
1394,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,2,although this book is around num pages it goes by quickly as the plot moves along smoothly there’s not too much excitement or action but it ties in nicely to previous and future novels the two most prominent issues have to do with the writing character perspectives are not clear as they switch often and without a break in the text also near the end there are many grammatical issues overall it is a casual read if you are interested in some background of valdemar but might not make you w
1395,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,i would categorize this as ya fantasy young talia leaves her home where she is underappreciated and about to embark on a life of servitude she meets rolan a magical horse with whom she forms an immediate connection rolan takes her to the collegium where she will learn how to become a herald a protector of the queen in addition she is to take charge of elspeth the queen s spoiled daughter talia discovers she has innate gifts as she makes friends and some enemies i enjoyed the book for
1396,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,really really good book i read almost num one day and finished it in the next couple lackey s writing is very easy to read and her concepts are worded in a way that makes them clear to understand i was a little bummed about talia and skif for awhile but the end made up for that really the only complaint i have is that it is sometimes hard to follow the flow of time lackey mentions the leaves changing and the seasons but it still becomes muddled in terms of weeks/months/years i will
1397,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,the pairing of teens and companions magical horses would make this a strong read alike for the dragonriders of pern series by anne mccaffrey the strong feminist tones recall marion zimmer bradley to whom this book is dedicated the tones also harken to anne mccaffrey additionally the young unwanted child going to a school for magic to find themselves and destiny ties into the harry potter series by j k rowling but with a strong female twist 
1398,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,this is one of my favorite books from when i was younger so rereading it at as an adult makes it even more special there are so many nuances that i didn t see when i was younger this book has magic fantasy and an incredible world that is richly developed the main character in this book is a young girl named talia it follows her story as she finds herself swept up into mystery myth and new family 
1399,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,the beginning of a wonderful tale arrows of the queen marks the start but not chronologically of lackey s tales of valdemar and what a great start it is fantasy world building shown through the eyes of a character that believes the world itself is a fairy tale queen is charming while placing plot points and hints enough to sustain another num books valdemar is one of my favorite series and arrows my favorite trilogy within it 
1400,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,reminded me somewhat of tamora pierce books but with less conflict i would say the one big drawback to the book was lack of conflict there were things that happened and a sinister plot against the kingdom but we were removed from it in perspective the novel is obviously meant for a younger reader than myself it has magic horses who are important characters and the leads great struggle is accepting her own self worth but it made a pleasant read while doing my laundry 
1401,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,little did i know this was exactly the book i needed to read it is the story of a num year old girl suddenly whisked away from everything she s known and put into the world she wanted to be in it could be considered a princess tale with more realism if you want to see it that way lackey is an author i have enjoyed as the first published work of hers i must say i thoroughly enjoyed it having read the first novel of some more modern popular writers i have to say it s too bad that they were
1402,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,excellent book for all ages but especially good for pre teens teens dealing with feeling isolated the lead character in this book will be very relatable i have always enjoyed mercedes lackey s writing especially the heralds of valdemar series and the nice thing is the talia trilogy you do not need to actually read the previous books in the main part of the series to be able to follow talia s story though i definitely recommend all of the books in the full series if you can 
1403,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,having finished the adept series have decided to re read from my owned books mercedes lackey s valdemar series which should take a good bit a time liked this story quite a bit pretty much that of the classic misfit who does not fit in her place and is whisked away to where she not only fits in but is very much needed thought it was a little short on action with a lot of the story working on setting up lackey s world but it was a quick absorbing read nonetheless 
1404,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,i love all the mercedes lackey books i got the audiobook version via hoopla listened to most of it last night and the rest today given a choice of fictional places to actually live in valdemar would top my list i like the amount of detail given to the infrastructure and the characters live on in my imagination in some ways these stories remind me of pern and of darkover which is not in the least surprising 
1405,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,i don t know why i ve waited so long to read mercedes lackey probably because i knew she had a bazillion books and that i would get suckered into reading them all this story took me back to my younger days of reading tamora pierce and other strong lady character fantasies and genuinely enjoying fantasy i ve been getting bored of the genre lately but i think my love is about to get rekindled as i devour the rest of this series 
1406,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,really solid book lots of tropes but the main character is really well developed i enjoyed the world building and the plot the friendship with the mentor figure was well done and emotionally satisfying the love interest plot point was strangely developed and probably the only thing i didn’t enjoy about the story 
1407,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,it was nice to read this book again returning to valdemar is always fun and i like it when the problems the heroes face are bullies and bandits rather than world ending cataclysms it s always nice to read about talia and friends and i especially likes reading about her friendship and not relationship with skif 
1408,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,this had everything i love in a book great characters action change magic a great main character and wonderful supporting characters i read this book in one sitting and now can’t wait to get the next book my favorite books are the alanna the lioness books by tamora pierce and i found a lot of the same elements in this book 
1409,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,this was a book i read as a child i was bullied and spent most of my time reading even though i am male it presented such an amazing perspective the perspective it provided helped reduce the impact of my trauma i now work to help people professionally i continue to recommend this novel/series as a way of explaining how to protect yourself from powerful emotions 
1410,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,i read the three book series i liked up until the end i wanted more and all the other books that are a compliment to this series don t give you an update on the people in this particular series i think the writer made a mistake in not giving a bigger picture after the last book in the heralds of valdemar series 
1411,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,the first part of a trilogy the heralds of valdemar and my first mercedes lackey novel and i m impressed the story of a young girl being chosen to be a herald how she develops and grows into the role is engaging fun and written in an uncomplicated style that makes reading it a pleasure well worth looking at if you enjoy fantasy novels 
1412,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,i loved this book so much the characters the world the gifts the companions the feminism it s a breath of fresh air and i can t believe it s taken me so long to read these i ve read the black griffon trilogy and some other of her books but never these i especially love how she described the most mundane details of daily tasks and how loving and real her characters seem 
1413,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,obviously the first of a trilogy as the book spends a fair amount of time establishing setting and character which is fine fairly light in tone but with hints of darkness to come talia is a little mary sue ish at times still an enjoyable ya fantasy with an interesting setting and likable characters 
1414,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,this was really great and held up to my memory of the book i read it when in was younger and wasn t sure it d still be good i love talia as a character and think all the characters develop well i wish there was a more nuanced character and plot development but honestly it s a good story and totally worth the read 
1415,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,a young girl from a sheltered and repressively religious background who has her head in the clouds and a passionate desire to become a herald of valdemar finds a lone companion and takes a wild ride away from her family and all she knew to become a trainee this story is wonderfully written and proves that family is not just blood its the people who love you 
1416,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,i used to love this series i needed a quick light read so i picked up this one again i can understand why i liked it before but it seems dated and underwritten part of me wants to read the next two to see if my old liking comes through and part of me wants to cut my losses and tackle the rest of my to be read shelf 
1417,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,expectations really are key to reading experience this was one of my least favorite valdemar trilogies when i was younger so my hopes were low when i picked this up for a reread but most of the stuff i remember hating apparently happens in the later books this one is really not that bad a solid old school young girl goes off to magic school fantasy novel 
1418,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,this was a great book if you read the series you will understand the plot but if you jump right into the end of a twenty plus book series there are many things you won t understand i personally read many of the books from black griffin to the owls trilogy and loved all of them 
1419,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,3,this was ok a story about making friends and finding out where you belong the magic and mystery in the story is off screen it is talked about and solved by others i would have found this more interesting if this story was written in numrd person omniscient 
1420,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,i can t believe i haven t read this one yet this is a story about a girl being chosen by a magical creature and ending up at a special school there are so many books like this song of the lioness sprung to mind immediately i really liked it and want the next one right now 
1421,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,really sweet and awesome fantasy loved the characterization and developement n stuffs wow i actually finished a book most of the time i just return say num books to the library num overdue four unread two read one half finished 
1422,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,2,the plot arc and the setting are more like british boarding school than fantasy also everybody keeps using the word awfully a lot but mercedes lackey is american i checked it s strange it also doesn t help that talia is the saccharine archetype of feminine virtue 
1423,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,2,it was fine i feel like i would have liked this much more num years ago but at this point it was slightly too old school for me i got my fill of this type of story with various other ya herione novels when i was actually a teenager 
1424,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,a bit of magic and folklore about a young girl who finds out she is chosen to be a prestigious herald and work for the queen of this fictional land liked it a lot but the second half of the book seemed to skim too much 
1425,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,this was a very enjoyable read talia s a strong character even though i wished she could have found faith in herself and others a bit sooner but it ll be interesting to follow her story in the next two books 
1426,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,this was so much fun and while i think it exhibits some of what are now considered tropes like the chosen one protagonist i think it pulls them off quite well and was still a great read a series with so many books in it though why do i keep doing this to myself 
1427,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,5,re read awesome book awesome series awesome world from an awesome author haven t read any of the valdemar books in a long time now so i figured it was time to start it all from scratch again 
1428,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,i really enjoyed this book i m a little very disappointed that i didn t find this series as a teenager there are times where i had to remind myself to suspend my disbelief but it was still a very fun read it reminds me a lot of the lioness series by tamora pierce 
1430,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,2,a fantasy where an oppressed num year old girl escapes and is selected as a herald working with a magic horse my wife says she read lots of books in this series and i see how a young girl would love it i made it to the time her herald school has bullies bullying her 
1431,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,2,sad shouldn t have revisited this as an adult loose storytelling massive plot holes loved it as a teen though

1456,Arrows of the Queen,Mercedes Lackey,4,this was super fun mercedes lackey is my go to fun reading a welcome break from graduate school 
1457,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,5,i haven t reviewed this because i read it so long ago that all i can remember is i loved it i ll take our very old and battered copy bought in num to the hospice this weekend when i go with celyn and see if i can t refresh my memory rip sir terry don t think of it as dying said death just think of it as leaving early to avoid the rush so to the review i ve just read this in slightly over num hours which is extraordinary for me i normally take a month to read a book it is to be
1458,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,reading the color of magic is akin to eating an entire bowl of ice cream just a little too fast sure it may cause your head to hurt at times but the sweet rewards make it all worth it filled with ambitious wizards and ruthless assassins the city of ankh morpork has survived many dangers in the past but now it faces an even more destructive force tourism when a rich but bored outsider named twoflower decides to explore the city in search for adventure it soon becomes an adventure for
1459,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,before picking it up i d heard that the colour of magic was funny now that can mean just about anything because let s face it comedy is the most subjective of arts funny is a deeply personal thing the funny peculiar and the funny ha ha might not be the same from person to person or even to the same person depending on their mood or their place in life so knowing something is funny ahead of reading it really doesn t tell me much i d read terry pratchett s neil gaiman s good omen
1460,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,i will officially be reading the entire discworld series 
1461,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,and so it begins … sir terry pratchett’s wildly imaginative discworld series begins with the num publication of the color of magic i have been reading science fiction and fantasy for a long time and somehow i managed to not read any of his works until i came in late to the party a friend suggested i try one i’d like it and so i read the fourth in the series mort and i thought so much that i decided i would climb the hill and enjoy every step begin with a heaping portion of british humor hum
1462,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,2,this must be the exception that proves the rule for years i’ve been adamantly advocating reading series in publication order whether a coherent story or a set of standalones in discworld that simply doesn’t seem to be the best solution everyone seems to suggest that a new reader should not start with the first book so this must be partially my fault for doing it anyway the colour of magic is at best a mediocre introduction to what is supposedly the best humourous fantasy series ever writte
1463,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,5,i m pretty sure people have told me about pratchett and his diskworld series before usually working in the phrase he s the douglas adams of fantasy into the description but the problem was that i always felt that i had had enough of adams after the third hithiker s guide to the galaxy book and whenever i scanned pratchett s section in the bookstore i was immediately put off by not knowing where to start reading among the approximately five hundred thousand diskworld books i m glad i finall
1464,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,if i hadn t already read the entire series and if i was judging this book just by its own merits i d still be saying that it harnesses the lightning and even finds a way to make it go side to side rather than up and down it s really fantastic as a straight fantasy with tons of humorous elements with a good deal more worldbuilding than all the later books more obvious and harsher tongue in cheek elements and a great setup for the great wizzard rincewind honestly i love rincewind i love the
1465,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,1,this series is much beloved of my friends both here on goodreads and out in the wilds of meatspace he s even been referred to as fantasy s answer to one of my favorite authors the superlatively funny and insightful douglas adams as such i was excited to start the series at the beginning hoping the wit and wisdom would overcome the warts of this early outing unfortunately the jokes drew more groans than guffaws reminding me of mark twain s comments on the book of friend and fellow america
1466,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,5,terry pratchett is a genius as usual this man can do no wrong he reminds me a lot of douglas adams my favorite in the realm of satire look at this similarity in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move douglas adams the restaurant at the end of the universe disc philosophers agree that the first men shortly after their creation understandably lost their temper terry pratchett the color of magic the co
1467,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,the color of magic discworld num terry pratchett the color of magic is terry pratchett s maiden voyage through the now legendary land of discworld this is where it all begins with the tourist twoflower and his wizard guide rincewind تاریخ نخستین خوانش ماه می سال num میلادی عنوان مجموعه جهان صفحه کتاب num رنگ جادو؛ تری پرتچت پراچت ؛ مترجم آرزو احمی؛ تهران، ویدا، چاپ اول و دوم num؛ در num ص؛ چاپ سوم num؛ شابک num؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان انگلیسی قرن num م دیسک ورلد یک مجمو
1468,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,“it is at this point that normal language gives up and goes and has a drink ” i never really planned to read this until i met someone who loves the discworld novels so much that i could no longer put them off also this series has so many books that i will probably never be able to finish it which kept me from reading it in the first place apart from the fact that they always seemed a bit too ridiculous to actually be good now i did catch myself laughing a few times and generally enjoying it
1469,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,a charming and sometimes tedious novel rincewind grew on me quickly and i enjoyed watching him get into and out of scrapes along the way death s and fate s frustration with him was hilarious i kept imagining them as toddlers stomping their feet d two flower i was so so on sometimes he charmed me and others eh his optimism seemed misplaced sometimes but he had good intentions a nice start to the series plenty of action and some humor the scenes with krull and near the edge of the
1470,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,2,it had some funny moments but i really struggled to get through it in all fairness to the people who suggested i read the discworld series this is not one of the ones they said i should start with i think i mostly had a hard time slogging through all of the world building and made up words fantasy has never been my thing because i m not someone who enjoys reading descriptions of the characters surroundings i m not giving up on the series though i think i ll just go back through my book
1473,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,5,precisely why all the above below in this review i guess should be so is not clear but goes some way to explain why on the disc the gods are not so much worshipped as blamed have you ever wondered about what would happen if you were merely a pawn in a game played by gods have you ever wondered about how living in a flat earth would be would you like to learn about what failed wizards do in their free time are you curious about how dragons are born and how they rest do you want to un
1474,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,2,meh it just didn t do it for me unfortunately this book has been recommended to me so many times by well meaning friends who know my love of absurd british humor that it couldn t possibly live up to the hype it suffers from the hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy syndrome for years everyone i knew friends family students co workers would ask me if i had read hitchhiker s and their mouths would drop when i admitted no i hadn t yet their response was always the same oh but you h
1475,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,the very first discworld novel the one it all began with i ve been a fan of sir terry s for a long time i ve even read a few other of his books some standalone some of the fairy tales or later volumes of this series and loved them all fans have given me two pieces of advice ever since i first heard of discworld num stay away from the first num books num read them all what are you a savage lol you can see how this made me undecided for the longest time thus i did what every self respected
1476,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,5,i first read this book many years ago and i remember i fell in love with the disc world as soon as i read the first few pages i loved the idea of the turtle swimming through space and the elephants and the rim fall and the eighth colour in the spectrum called octarine twoflower and rincewind were the first of many of pratchett s characters i would meet who are so helpless and yet who blunder successfully through mishap after mishap and as for the luggage that has to be one of the best invent
1478,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,2,i dunno if this is going to be a proper review heh as though any of the things that i write in this space are it ll likely just be a bunch of randomness and ranting so like my usual offerings i read amanda s review this un and i m all like yep this is one of those books/series that people love and it makes me want to love it and then i set crazy goals for myself like reading them all in a year just maybe not this one and then when the first one ends up not being the
1479,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,back to where it all began i think this is my third time reading this but that does show how long ago my introduction to this series was i have a huge affection for this entire series and the author as a human being but i m actually quite glad that i wasn t a more sophisticated reader when i was first exposed to this if this had been my first exposure to his work today i m not sure i would have continued with them in summary the discworld experiences its first tourist twoflower from the
1480,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,magic never dies it merely fades away i first visited the world of discworld at the age of twelve when i was still wolfing down picture books and fingering through easy peasy written books then one day i saw a friend prancing around with this book to classes i have a sharp eye on colourful book covers and this one s won me over i demanded asked to borrow this and right on the spot he let me back home i immediately flipped to page one upon the first few paragraphs however my brain went d
1481,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,i read this book way back in high school when i lived in england having forgotten everything except for the fact that there was a trunk that liked to eat people i bought the book again to see how it stood up these many years later as i ve read i ve received goodreads messages and been spoken to by several people who have warned me that pratchett was just warming up with this one that he hadn t reached his highest form yet i still have to read more of his work i m planning on mort and gu
1482,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,are you looking for a book about a frustrated incompetent wizard loser guiding a tourist around a world comprised of a flat disc sitting on a turtle’s back a gigantic turtle that flies though space well look no further the color of magic is your ticket of all the discworld books of all the craziness the thousands of jokes the laser guided satire of fantasy novels so good that it became almost its own genre for me the color of magic is the one book to rule them all maybe it’s because thi
1483,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,zany wild preposterous and oh so fun—i understand the discworld hype and see why it s such a fan favourite but underneath all the light humour is clever trope subversion and a sense that pratchett knows exactly what he s doing more so than just a few laughs this first installment isn t an immediate favourite but it s a promising start to a series i m looking forward to reading i know there are a ton of discworld reading guides out there but i m a stickler for published order and i m going
1484,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,5,this was the perfect pick me up after the depressing depressing depressing downer if the road by cormac mccarthy i laughed out loud reading this and that is not something i do very often rincewind is a new favorite character and terry pratchett is a new favorite author i m not sure i would have loved this as much i i hadn t been in the perfect mood for it but i was in the perfect mood and i did love it 
1485,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,the first time i read this book i thought it was okay not the best discworld but okay but each time i re read it i like it more i mean there is the pern parody that is great there is the kick ass daughter who inherits there are the riffs on heroes and yet there is the fact that we are all rincewind i know i know i m an american so i should be twoflower but rincewind is what we would all be if we were in lotr old review num the thing about this isn t the brilliant with and humor it i
1488,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,ahh the story of twoflower and the failed wizard rincewind although calling rincewind a failed wizard is possibly not really fair to him as he s only a failed wizard because having sneaked a look at a forbidden spell book one the num great spells has taken up the room in his brain that would be needed for other spells and he can t get it out at least not without casting it and since neither he nor the other wizards know what it will do destroy the world the universe the multiverse 
1489,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,2,dnf at num what actually went through my head while i was reading this stupid moron i can t believe he lent me a book without thoroughly knowing my taste way to ruin a book for someone hey this is actually pretty good i hate everything that s hilarious time to think about all those scholarships you haven t filled out yet so lazy did i fall asleep i think i just stared at this page for half an hour this plot is really interesting but i can t focus focus already time to think about all the g
1490,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,i first read this book about num years ago at the urging of a co worker under pressure to read and return i zipped through this book and its immediate sequel the light fantastic unimpressed and declined to read additional entries in the series i recently took the opportunity to re read the color of magic for a group discussion in a gr book club and i enjoyed it much more this time through the story itself is really a collection of four related stories featuring the same characters and set in
1491,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,this was a fun quick read i enjoyed it and plan to read my way through disc world this somewhat cartoonish seeming universe is populated by colorful and unlikely characters the author created an original and interesting mythology and multiverse hidden within the tongue and cheek humor and somewhat silly action is an intelligence and insightful view of not just those make believe world but ours as well many references are to actual occult concepts and the magic while loose humorous and e
1492,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,1,i m probably one of the few readers on this planet and surrounding galaxies that don t enjoy terry pratchett s prose 
1495,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,originally rated num stars when i joined goodreads although i actually read it about twenty years ago and rated it from memory so num ish years on i got nostalgic about terry pratchett and decided to re read them and here i am already losing steam it was fantastic to visit rincewind twoflower the sapient pearwood luggage ankh morpork and of course death i chuckled and laughed in many places and yet either it wasn t as good as i remembered or i ve changed will i re read any of the others 
1497,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,this was quite the interesting and funny little book so much is happening in these num odd pages so many characters my mind has been entertained as well as confused i enjoyed rincwind and twoflower death is also great discworld is going to be a fun journey 
1498,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,full review to come a nice light read not as whimsical as i thought it would be but still a good amount of whimsy plus it is nice to read a fantasy book without the fate of the world at stake 
1500,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,this started so well so so well insert disappointed sigh i m probably living under a rock but i didn t actually know that discworld books or at least this book were a satire of fantasy to fully enjoy this you need to have at least some knowledge of the things he s making fun of the hero the stupid overblown plots the ex machina situations it makes it even better if you have read the book he s referencing cough the dragonriders of pern cough and hated the very same things he s po
1501,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,2,everyone said this wasn t the best pratchett book there is everyone was right 
1502,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,executive summary started slow but finished strong full review i ve been meaning to read discworld for awhile a good friend of mine loves the series and recommended it to me over num years ago but i just never got around to it he suggested i might be better off starting with guards guards than this book however between picking up the first few books on a sale and my general need to read thing in publication order my understanding is that while all the books are set in discworld there ar
1503,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,how can something so silly be so addictive 
1505,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,2,the city of ankh morpork bears a name that rolls off the tongue doesn t it this is supposed to be a funny adventure it kind of is but unfortunately there are few examples if half funny stuff the humor is very british and quite hit and miss i m thankful though that the tone is kept light and there s no dark humor in this book this is the one book that made me discouraged in pursuing the series but given that few books are very good i might give it another go because i m quite curious a
1506,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,with a more conclusive ending and a slightly less episodic/random plot i’d probably bump this classic satirical fantasy novel up to four stars but as it is i enjoyed reading the colour of magic the douglas adams comparisons are obvious – and apt i think both authors bring a very dry british wit to a well worn genre tweaking the conventions in a way that is both amusing though rarely laugh out loud hilarious and affectionate in this case the characters of the luggage and death are terri
1507,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,i enjoy reading science fiction and fantasy but my mother always says that she does not she claims that in this sort of book the author can allow the characters to do anything and there are no set rules for the natural world to obey i generally disagree with her good science fiction and fantasy authors invent a world and they invent the parameters of the possible and stick within those limits however in this book i must say anything goes there are no limits to the magic it is boun
1508,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,2,i was warned by a lot of people to not start discworld in chronological order from friends to neil gaiman and also to not give up the series if the first book didn t work but i m stubborn and here i am i also like to see authors evolving in the craft and chronological order also helps with that but i now do know where their warnings come from i loved the description of the world in the case of the turtle and space as countries were a bit lacking and this had some great one liners and quot
1509,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,a fun parody of the fantasy genre and some great world building i ve been listening to this one for the past two weeks i found myself out of shape and in need of something that would hold my concentration whilst i taught my body to exercise again ordinarily i m not a fan of audiobooks but it seemed like the perfect way and the perfect time to get started on the great discworld re read that i ve had planned for the past two years it worked it s been many many years since i last read this book 
1510,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,num num it is at this point that normal language gives up and goes and has a drink this was my second pratchett book and i must admit that i enjoyed my first one more however guards guards was a later novel where the author had improved his craft considerably that of course doesn t mean that the colour of magic is bad far from it pratchett joyfully throws many things in this crazy silly adventure playing on words and concepts some indeed hilarious loved the big bang while satirising
1511,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,over the years i ve dipped into the discord books now and then and really struggled to get what the fuss was about i usually found them boring and gave up then i decided to give them a proper go and start reading from book num suddenly things clicked and i was converted the characters are brilliant the story is mad and moves along at one hell of a pace the luggage is my hero pratchett has his own unique writing style and if you can get into it then you re in for a great reading experience 
1512,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,5,hilarious short and imaginative only num something more books in the series to go 
1513,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,i often found myself giggling while reading this book a very good thing i just like the fun and the picaresque in it i can t wait to read the rest of the series 
1514,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,1,i tried i really did thought for sure this would be perfect for me to read oh well proof that what everyone else loves may not be right for you 
1515,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,author terry pratchett may be the modern day mark twain one of the most prolific satirical authors in genre fiction the world he spins his elaborate metaphors is that of discworld a setting in which he has successfully parodied everything from opera to religion from currency to war from morris dancing to mall proliferation but before discworld was a template upon which all things modern could be parodied it was simply a parody and a mediocre one at best pratchett s humor is similar in ma
1516,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,i had a number of preconceived notions about the discworld novels which is probably why i took so long before i attempted one fortunately my preconceptions were mostly innacurate what i will say about terry pratchett s writing and the humour in particular it can be pretty random there were times when i went huh or erm or just sighed in perplexity he is also not afraid of applying deus ex machina to his sequences climaxes that being said these books are a blast to read and the
1517,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,when introduced to the world as a giant space turtle with elephants on its back and a disc upon theirs i surely thought that the author s wife was slipping lsd in his coffee every morning then i was informed that this was a somewhat widespread belief and i realized that people were probably sharing the opium pipe back then either way it made for quite an entertaining notion of the universe the mighty wizard rincewind he s really only mighty because he has an unknown diabolical spell burie
1519,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,2,meh i just can t think of much more to say about it i only read it because it briefly mentions the discworld librarian but that brief mention was one mention and no description not worth it loved the tiffany aching subset so there might be other discworld books i d enjoy but this wasn t one 
1520,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,beware here be dragons and trolls and a suitcase with legs a wizard and an unflappable tourist share a rather silly adventure 
1521,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,loved this so much proof that satire and fantasy can mix perfectly especially if written by the hand of pratchett 
1522,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,this book is so utterly unique that it s borderline genius but in a wonky way i m almost embarrassed to admit that it s taken my entire num years of life to actually get started on reading the late legendary terry pratchett when i agreed to jump into a discworld review a month group i was secretly excited to have an excuse to read such a huge series i think that s why i ve always put it off because honestly who has the time for the kind of commitment being the blame it on someone else 
1524,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,having recently read swords of lankhmar i was able to recognize a marked influence of leiber on this opening volume of pratchett s popular discworld series like nehwon the discworld is a swords and sorcery flavored fantasy realm where the social environment is generally not a benevolent one pratchett s corrupt and decadent city of ankh morpork has certain similarities to lankhmar and bravd and the weasel here are very reminiscent of fafhrd and the gray mouser potentates on the discworld ev
1525,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,i was expecting to barely get through this i read it twenty years ago started me on discworld but my opinion of it has gone downhill ever since it s just a cheap parody after all it turns out that parody aside which itself is an interesting aspect as the thing parodied sword and sorcery is itself now dead and buried this is a thrillingly creative book the imagination the wit and the erudition of pratchett shine forth on every page indeed there is far more of his chaotic genius

1534,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,[from the preface ] the discworld is not a coherent fantasy world its geography is fuzzy its chronology unreliable a small traveling circle of firelight in a chilly infinity has turned out to be the home of defiant jokes and last chances there are no maps you can t map a sense of humor anyway what is a fantasy map but a space beyond which there be dragons on the discworld we know that there be dragons everywhere they might not all have scales and forked tongues but they be here all right

1555,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,to be honest i am not really sure what i think of this book i enjoyed it certainly it was wildly creative of course it basically reverses science and magic making magic the real thing and science the myth i suspect that residents of discworld would find the book significantly less amusing than we do simply because so much of the humor comes from references to science which is not there case in point it was as if the ocean had decided to create life without going through all that tedio

1614,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,what an amusing read it was easy to get into this unique world where every possible fantasy trope resides the dialogues are witty and they don t really generate a laugh but some chuckles and loads of smile it s good to read something that s pointedly poking fun at many tropes and usual plot twists one finds in this genre reading this book as an adult is a different experience as the themes one would look for is largely absent there is nothing subtle in the story motifs exist as a satirical

1626,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,this was my first experience with terry pratchett although i’d seen enough comments about discworld to have a general idea of what to expect i was skeptical about reading it because i knew it employs the type of humor that i just don’t seem to properly appreciate but i was also curious about it i’m talking about that unrealistic kind of humor that makes you laugh at the author’s cleverness yet at the same time pulls you out of the story because it’s too ridiculous to take seriously is the

1633,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,5,after hearing the sad news of terry pratchett s passing last week i decided it was time to work my way through the discworld novels again as i have been promising myself i d do for years now so i rushed up to my book shelves only to find i had lent the colour of magic to someone and it had never come back so what was i to do i headed to my home town the next day and began a search through all the book stores and charity shops and eventually found one copy just one copy madness i though
1634,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,5,this was an enjoyable book it s impressive for myself to believe i never ever heard of terry pratchett or any of his works i love the fantasy genre and it just feels wrong to not know this author i m grateful to have received this book as a gift the colour of magic is filled with well magic all over the place for some part of the book i felt very lost it is a common and known feeling to be dropped in an unknown new universe with many new characters as the pages went by i made myself more
1636,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,to see how it all began has been interesting for me pratchett s later discworld books have a firmly established style and even some of the earliest entries in the series that i ve read mort or equal rites for example are very different the colour of magic is frequently entertaining but a bit too much all over the place for me i actually came to like our dynamic duo of rincewind and twoflower a lot and the luggage is one of my favourite characters but this was a bit too experimental for m
1637,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,what do you have when the following ingredients are added to the story a magical walking suitcase an insurance agent/tourist a failed wizard gods playing chess with humans as their pawns a world which is carried by four elephants who themselves are carried by turtle a chaos well the first book in discworld combines all these factors together and what you have is total madness but there is definitely a pattern in this madness the pattern basically consists of making fun of troupes in f
1638,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,num num hubby and i decided to do a reread of the discworld series in publication order the rincewind stories have always been some of my least favorite so i had to sort of force myself to get reading before the month was up i was pleasantly surprised to find that while this is still far from my favorite i did enjoy it more than i remember enjoying it on my first go maybe because i went in with lower expectations or maybe just because i found more humour in it than i was able the first time th
1639,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,2,to all the pratchett fanatics out there and there are a ton i apologize for the rating and review but this book was dreadful let me explain this was my first terry pratchett book everyone told me not to start at the first chronological book but i have to start at num it s just how i m built i have to admit that i laughed out loud twice read passages i read to others twice and grinned probably half a dozen times that s what lead to the two star rating i was leaning towards one star rating
1641,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,5,one thing is for sure terry pratchett is one of my favorite authors from now on this must be my first sci fi/fantasy/comedy novel first of all i was floored by the level of imagination used in this book and hence i can only imagine how a person can write more than forty odd novels around the theme of a disc shaped world a man and the man is terry pratchett in this case has to be maddeningly brilliant to have written what is written in this book i finished almost num/numth of the book today an
1642,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,5,a world supported on the backs of num large elephants and sporting them is a massive flying turtle we find our selves watching the events of an inept wizard a naive tourist whose luggage moves on a hundred little legs and dragons who only exist if you believe in them and of course the edge of the planet literally the edge the world in this universe is a flat disc i love this book so much i love death in this hes such a great character and twoflower is so silly optimistic attitude a
1643,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,this is the first time i ve read the colour of magic i ve dabbled with the discworld on a few occasions and enjoyed the books i have read so i wanted to try them from the beginning it s a bumpy start isn t it this is an incredibly episodic novel and i m not sure i identified any plot really we bounced from event to event some of which were so surreal as to be virtually unreadable the characters were dreadfully thin it comes to something when the best character by far is made of wood bu
1644,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,1,i ve always hated fantasy and i still do this book was disorganized to the point that reading it made my soul hurt i guess part of that could have been trying to read it while sick but even then i didn t see that it really helped me any to put this in my brain from what i understand the books do get better as the series meanders along but i m not going to buy more i might read them if i run out of anything else to read and happen to be in the “p” section of the library still the fact
1645,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,so i finally got around to the famous discworld i was rather expecting to be blown away but despite the well crafted universe who doesn t love a giant turtle i was not amazed the story is interesting but inconsistently paced and the beginning buts are much better than the end bits the sapient pearwood luggage ex machina gets a little old after awhile also the novelty of twoflower s naivete wears a bit thin the man should get a bit more worldly after all his crazy experiences as
1648,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,this book does for fantasy what hitchhikers guide to the galaxy did for science fiction wish someone had told this to me earlier i would have picked it long back i am so glad to have finally started this series it is absolutely hilarious considering how people say this series gets funnier i am pretty sure i will love this series the characters are so amazing the main protagonist rincewind was okay but the luggage twoflower and death were my favorite characters now going to read the next
1649,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,5,i love discworld this is the start of my second read of the series quite an undertaking at this point this the first book is strangely episodic that s not a bad thing it s just very different from what will come later having read the later books i can spot the things that have been tweaked namely the patrician huge tweak there but this is a great start to what would turn out to be a great series and i still like rincewind believe it or not 
1650,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,a fun chaotic book it suffers a little in comparison to my first foray into discworld guards guards since it was hard not to read rincewind and twoflower as less engaging versions of vimes and carrot but it s still really delightful packed with clever ideas and really well paced as long as you don t mind your pacing frenetic 
1651,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,5,the second best book i have read this year ready player one is still the best i had been planning on delving into pratchett s discworld for a while and his passing made it more fitting to do so now why did i wait so long this book is somewhere between amazing and hilarious while keeping you guessing and rooting for the characters pratchett was a mad genius and will be sorely missed thank you terry for the discworld i will most definitely be continuing the series 
1652,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,ah so whoever it was that advised me to start with the watch books instead of going by publication chronology was completely right probably the most entertaining thing about these books is watching pratchett working really hard to tune his funny and there are flickers of that perfect pitch he has later but mostly it s just sort of random incidents strung together and there s only occasional bits of there there 
1653,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,1,this book frustrated me to no end very near the beginning of it i thought about throwing it across the room because i could not for the life of me follow a conversation on about page num i read and reread and reread those pages to no avail i finished the book because my husband told me it was wonderful and funny and i would really enjoy it i didn t 
1654,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,we just finished this up as a read aloud with my teens this was their first foray into the discworld and while they didn t hate it they didn t seem to love it either honestly this isn t my favorite discworld but i thought we ought to begin at the beginning i think when we do small god s later this year they will enjoy it more 
1657,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,4,the first book in the discworld series and clear evidence of the brilliance that is terry pratchett i was fascinated by the adventures of the tourist whose luggage has legs and the reluctant wizard as they find themselves in one tight fix after another throughout the land 
1658,The Color of Magic,Terry Pratchett,3,this should be num num stars i really enjoyed it but found it all kind of random and leading nowhere that being said it was very imaginative and entertaining hrun the barbarian was one of my favorites as was anything the luggage did

1666,J.R.R. Tolkien 4-Book Boxed Set: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings,J.R.R. Tolkien,3,writers who inspire a genre are usually misunderstood tolkien s reasons for writing were completely unlike those of the authors he inspired he didn t have an audience a genre and scores of contemporaries there was a tradition of high adventure fairy tales as represented by eddison dunsany morris macdonald haggard and kipling but this was only part of what inspired tolkien his writing was chiefly influenced by his familiarity with the mythological traditions of the norse and welsh cul

Tolkien,5,i first read the hobbit at the ripe old age of num and remember having to really concentrate to finish it i was probably still emerging from a really heavy judy blume phase at the time even then i already had a true sense of loyalty of tolkien thanks to that great animated cartoon i watched as a little kid when i later read the trilogy in high school it was far easier to immerse myself in tolkien s writing though i love all of the books by far my favorite is the two towers i think it s

Tolkien,5,my third time to read the hobbit and the lord of the rings trilogy i read all the poetry and verse this time i loved these books they are so different from the typical fiction of this genre these were so well written so well thought through i love how they teach loyalty fidelity duty and love of things more than self they connect back to the greatness of the past one other thing we see that evil gets nervous also and that it will eventually collapse in on itself in many pieces that
1671,J.R.R. Tolkien 4-Book Boxed Set: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings,J.R.R.

Tolkien,2,again i can t do epics i will watch the movie rather than read this again any day of the week the writing s very dense and it s clear that tolkien was a major history buff he s created a world that is fully fully fleshed out he probably could have written you a tome that details every moment of middle earth for num years which may be the simarillion actually i don t know i only made it fifty pages into that one but i just don t have the patience for it after reading these as a

1719,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,wickedly amazing world building but sadly too little character portrayal if that s even a thing it was too adventure driven for my taste and while the setting immediately fascinated me i never felt like i knew the characters and thus could never rly connect with them 
1720,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,this was a thoroughly enjoyable fresh feeling book about num year old sabriel and her quest through the land of her birth if more ya was written like this i d read more of it of course i should point out that this book was published in num well before the genre was twilighted and as such there were no uber emo teenagers angsting over their melodramatic love triangles and thank the universe for that instead we get a sensible and somewhat awkward young heroine who is afraid of the dark c
1721,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,sabriel s father is the abhorsen the most powerful of necromancers who can bind the dead and stop them breaking through to the real world since her mother died when she was born sabriel is sent away to boarding school and only sees her father twice per year the kingdom they live in is divided into two parts with a wall protected by strong magic ancelstierre the southern kingdom where sabriel is sent to school is safe and people live uneventful lives without the use of magic but the norther
1722,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,the good i’ll start by saying that i would have loved this when i was num it is full of cool ideas the standard fantasy setting here is under threat from an undead wizard and its hordes and also happens to border via a magical wall a setting analogous to early numth century britain all protected by a line of hereditary necromancers the action scenes are very well written especially the ending and there is the most badass cat i’ve ever met in a book the bad i know this is intended for a y
1723,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,possibly the greatest compliment that i could give this book is to say that it reminds me in a non copy cat way of the first fantasy series to really sweep me away in my teenhood that would be none other than the belgariad series by david eddings sabriel is a story about a badass heroine who is charged with saving the world i love that shit guys the world building although at times tedious is amazing i love the way this world is created how death itself is portrayed and necromance
1724,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,this book takes an excruciatingly long time to really pick up its pace to be honest if i had not bought this book about a year ago i would definitely have quit i have picked it up and abandoned it quite frequently over the year mostly because about num pages through the book i would start yawning now that is a privilege especially reserved for school textbooks thus my reluctance but once you go through those first mind numbing num pages this book is actually pretty decent the novel is
1725,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,i have read many fantasy books and i can say with certainty that this is one of those stories that stand out sabriel is a very unique interesting complex story like many other fantasy books it takes a little time to understand what is going on and really get into the story but when that happens you will most likely take a deep breath dive in and refuse to come out before the end sabriel is a young girl but she is an adult inside a strong female character is a gem she is not annoying or
1726,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,[num num stars] sabriel is such a wonderful story really i absolutely adored it the only criticism i really have is that the magic was at times confusing and there isn t much character development that being said i could really ignore most of that because sabriel was so fabulous and the magic was so cool and mogget was so great i m not really sure what else to say this book surprised me i didn t expect to love it as much as i did but here i am absolutely loving it i can t wait to read the
1727,Sabriel,Garth Nix,2,updated below i started this and wanted to give up in frustration about one fifth of the way in but the book gets an awful lot of love from many well respected friends on gr and i m tempted to give it another go my problem was mostly with the quality of the writing which i found awful to be frank there are various things that just seem wrong although one can make out the intended sense and there is much more that just seems heavy and clunky odd word choices labored explanations of the
1728,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,this was me trying how a ya fantasy book would go down as an audiobook as i mentioned previously i struggle with audiobooks because it drives me nuts when narrators do ‘voices’ it’s completely unavoidable and maybe non fiction is the only thing acceptable for me in that format this one was read by tim curry and as long as he was doing villains or the creepy cat it worked wonderfully but him doing trying to do a voice of an num year old girl was plain disturbing old dude with raspy voices can
1729,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,read this quite some time ago and have been meaning to get to the sequels for some time so first i reread this one this is an interesting ya novel set in a world that is split there is ancelstierre the southern kingdom which is a technological society about at the level of world war i era earth that would be our earth it seems much like the uk as they play rugby and cricket at the boarding schools there is no magic in ancelstierre as a matter of fact they mostly regard magic and

1731,Sabriel,Garth Nix,1,piece of trash dont even bother starting this i was bored the whole time its totally weird and what the heck i never really got what they were doing and why they were doing it i never got what the bad guys were this book is confusing and so boring you dont even want to try to figure out whats going on dont waste your time on this you have better things to do like hitting your head agaisnt the wall 
1732,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,this book has so many great things going for it i almost don t know where to start let s go with the title character herself sabriel at the beginning of the book she s a relatively normal schoolgirl suddenly thrust into a world that she has a limited understanding of and isn t entirely prepared for with an incredible responsibility and she reacts quite admirably there s a certain reluctance to assume the full depth of her new responsibilities but that has more than a little to do with h
1733,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,reading this book was a pleasant experience while considered a ya book its tone was dark and forbidding with the lead character being a necromancer and practioner of charter magic she uses her newly learned powers to give the dead their final resting and to keep the sinister denizens of the land of the dead from making reentry into the world of living sabriel is the heir to a great power and a greater responsibility role character depth wasn t a big plus to this one but i feel most of th
1734,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,quite a good book not what i expected but to be honest i didn t know much about it to begin with definitely more of a world/plot driven book than a character driven one unique if at times confusing magic system but absolutely wonderful writing and a fantastic kick butt main character 
1735,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,if you don t know already i love zombies because of this i was really really looking forward to reading this book and i really enjoyed it sabriel the character is a bit complex one the one hand she s num she wants to be young and pretend responsibilities don t exist unfortunately she can t do that her dad kills dead things and is bound to complete this service at the sacrifice of his own life the kind with kids a wife a dog white picket fence etc and from a young age sabrie
1736,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,buddy read with maks num num stars meh boring until about num when other characters are introduced but still no great conflicts that kept me on the edge of my seat i agree with other reviewers that the characters are flat and bland however they are relatively likable world building was mediocre confusing a mish mash of medieval and contemporary settings strange to say the least the magic was unusual and sadly uninteresting unique but didn t have any feel of great power imo bells really over
1738,Sabriel,Garth Nix,1,amount read approximately num i actually read sabriel about five years ago and wasn t a fan because of how much my friends loved it literally every friend i have on goodreads i decided to give it a try once more this time i went for the audiobook because oh hey tim curry he could not save it the main thing i remember from my first reading is being mindnumbingly bored and that is how i feel this time i listened to the point where mogget the cat appears and i m not enamored with him eithe
1739,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,num num stars good characters strong world building and an excellent magic/necromancy system that was very unique well developed and internally consistant with as much fantasy as i read i am always thankful when i come across something truly unique and engaging this certainly fits the bill the magic of the abhorsen and its connection and exploration of the various stages of death was very well done and in my opinion the best feature of the story will defintely read the next book in the s

1741,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,this is one of the best books i came to pick up by chance at a bookstore for me this feels like high fantasy though it actually could hardly be counted as that when looking at all the typical genre denominators which are missing here the world the author has built is quite interesting all by itself there is a wall separating the north where magic is very much alive and rampant and the south which more or less boils down to a nums real world from a technical point of view in recent years 
1743,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,sabriel is relentlessly brave and strong heroine i liked the fact that this is a heroine centric novel the description of place in the ancient kingdom was magical i absolutely loved the abhorsen s house on the river island i wish i live in one the names of the magical creatures were simple and didn t need a dictionary i felt the ending was a bit rushed but that could be because i liked the book so much that i didn t want it end magical read

1746,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,reviewed by candace cunard for teensreadtoo com the first thing that hit me when i finished reading this book was that i should have read it much sooner i d been meaning to read it for the past six or seven years but never quite getting around to it and that was a mistake in sabriel garth nix introduces the reader to a compelling fantasy world that comes alive through the actions of the title character and others the old kingdom is a place of magic both charter magic wielded by those with
1747,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,this was my first book by this author and i loved it garth nix writes extremely well i really liked his world building and his original ideas i especially enjoyed reading about charter magic versus free magic and the journeys into death sabriel is a good strong female lead moggett is wonderful and touchstone redeemed himself by the end of the book i read a lot of fantasy and this was one of the better ones i have read in ages 
1748,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,i am not actually a fantasy reader yet i finally decided to begin with a new fantasy series it is sabriel let s start with my favorite part artwork sabriel [image error] sabriel going into the old kingdom touchstone mogget the cat that reminded me much of coraline s cat by neil gaiman the bells i knew they are a lot but i couldn t help it 🤣🤣 now comes the review the story plot was extensively attractive and a page turner at the very first few chapters although the story went so slow with intense
1749,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,this was one of my first steps into fantasy/paranormal series back when i originally read it in middle school and has stuck with me so much over the years that i recently re read it it is one of my absolute favorite books of all time and the series itself is vastly under rated and not discussed nearly enough first off the world in this series is so fantastic really it is two worlds in one there is our world and then there is the magical world that is separated from ours by a wall the
1750,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,i took an extended leave from the fantasy genre yesterday afternoon i decided to come back to the world of witchcraft and sorcery highly recommended by fellow peers i chose garth nix s well known sabriel frankly i was so impressed and drawn into the story that i finished it in two days and rushed to write an amazingly complementary review the plot was fantastic and fast paced there wasn t a moment i wasn t on the edge of my seat exhausting chapters of worthless garble is a common trait
1751,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,sabriel is a wonderful fantasy quest story that takes all the familiar tropes and makes them seem fresh and new there really isn t anything that s groundbreaking in this novel but it somehow seems like a story that s totally unique sabriel made me feel that same youthful excitement for reading that the harry potter books did and it was much shorter nix did a fabulous job of creating a very rich magical world in a small number of pages this is proof that fantasy does not have to cover ten
1752,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,overall this was a good fun book it took about half way to really draw me in it had a great climax and the writing style is very pleasant i plan to read the rest of the series the audiobook is narrated by tim curry who is great at it 
1753,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,excellent writing from mr nix excellent narration from mr curry 
1754,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,unique magical world and engaging characters 
1755,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,warning there may be a few spoilers ahead but i m not bothering to hide them just be careful with those eyes of yours num num stars i m going to be honest and say that as an overall novel there were parts where this felt like a three star book and parts that felt four star for instance upon reading the author s name this felt like a four star book garth nix good writer and a fellow australian but after delving fifty pages into the world of sabriel i was less than impressed however upon comple
1756,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,num stars it was amazing and one million stars for the audiobook narrated by tim curry he s fantastic this book has the coolest magic system i ve ever encountered the combination of sword bells magical marks stones and running water was really well done it also combines an english schoolgirl keep calm and carry on dignity with necromancy an uncommon pairing to be sure but i loved it and it really worked great characters fun story quick read i wish i d read it when i was younger 
1757,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,set in a world that is divided into a medieval esque tolkien like old kingdom and a certainly more modernistic ancelstierre sabriel is not exactly easy to get into the juxtaposition of two countries that are ruled by completely different principles namely magic and technology is fascinating but not simple for it takes a great deal of time to comprehend the magic of the old kingdom there is necromancy charter stones and magic charter ghosts sendings beings like the mordicant and much much
1758,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,this one is the final read for the tolkien professor’s faerie fantasy podcast seminar i started out really liking the book as the world and especially the necromantic magic system we are introduced to was really rather clever and interesting the story itself isn’t bad a bildungsroman following a young girl the titular sabriel who leaves her boarding school home to find out what has become of her father of course we soon find out that the boarding school which appears to exist in
1759,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,i m happy to report i enjoyed this book just as much on a reread as an adult as i did when i first read it in numth grade 
1761,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,bullet review i ve got a lot to say about this but i m on my phone in an airport between flights so i ll write my full thoughts later in the meantime yay for female protagonists yay for fantasy huh for what time period this falls into huh for the weird out of the blue forced romance huh/yay for the magic nonetheless i would probably read further and wouldn t hesitate to recommend this particularly to young adults with the caution about slight gore full review sabriel is going to boarding
1762,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,wow i know i am ridiculously late to the party but three words to sum this book up are magical spellbinding and astonishingly good okay that s four but i had to whittle the list down from twenty five all i can say is garth nix can write and i mean write he has this incredibly vivid imagination a beautiful way with words and crafts his story with love care and precision a few of the comments on gr have mentioned his writing style it is a little different to what i m used to but i
1763,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,i remember being in high school and the librarian at the time recommended it i d finished all of the eddings novels was up to date with harry potter and had read a few others unfortunately this never got going for me i found the writing really great the world intriguing but never really found the pace quick enough for my tatstes never did pick up the remaining books in the series seems to have a big following i think at the time i was into a certain type of fantasy and this just wasnt it
1766,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,sabriel was is wonderfully written story it’s high fantasy and full of magic may seem complex this book was very enjoyable and i found that surprising i expected it to be boring but this book is the opposite right from the beginning you are thrown into the this new world with awesome magic when sabriel s father goes missing sabriel is willing to do whatever it takes to find him she ventures into the old kingdom where magic runs free but that is not always good free magic creatures run
1767,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,buddy read with talia michelle sunshine and cassiev the world of the old kingdom and ancelstierre is fascinating to me between the two of them they seem to be a combination of classic medieval high fantasy and something of an industrial revolution/steampunk type of thing guns bows arrows and magic all have their uses as weapons in this world and that s something that i rarely see in fantasy books then again maybe i ve just not been reading the right ones and the whole aspect of
1768,Sabriel,Garth Nix,2,it’s a wonder i managed to finish this book since it bored me from beginning to end the average book rating for sabriel is above num so i guess i must have missed something i had no idea sabriel had been written in the nums and that might be where the problem lies the ya fantasy genre has evolved quite a lot since then especially post harry potter and sabriel just feels like it lacks… something i don’t know what exactly but the story and characters are just not engaging enough worse they fee
1769,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,well that was a fun and exciting read the minute i saw this book on gr i knew it was going to be a hit with me i don t know if it was the description of the story or the beautiful cover but this book was wonderful the main character and heroine of the story sabriel takes a dangerous and daring journey a desperate mission to find her father the abhorsen she s accompanied by a sarcastic cat like creature mogget and a young man touchstone who s a bit touch and go i really loved the worl
1770,Sabriel,Garth Nix,2,i m a huge fan of high fantasy so i totally expected to love this series but while i have nothing bad to say about sabriel it isn t a novel i d quite recommend either at least not to seasoned readers of fantasy if you ve read your fair share of adult fantasy then the plot of sabriel is simple and far too wordy for its predictability it s nothing new and i m somehow the only person on this planet who doesn t go ga ga at a talking cat so if you re a fan of ya fantasy and looking for someth
1771,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,num num from me looking forward to reading the rest of the series will talk about it more in my wrap up video tomorrow 
1772,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,as far as i can understand this book is particularly popular among friends of fantasy literature it has many ratings in goodreads and i find it on most of the lists with the best books of the genre so in the end i said to leave my objsction behind and read it okay i confess that the very nice cover has played a part in the decision which is quite different from what i m used to this is an interesting combination of high fantasy and horror literature the author creates the classical fantasy
1773,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,it was lovely to reread sabriel i think i read it quite a few times when i was younger but luckily garth nix seems to have lost none of his charm for me it helps that he has a female protagonist who isn t perfect who ends up with a near broken nose battered to bits and still finds love but that love isn t the most important thing the important thing the thing sabriel really has to accept is the passing on of her father s duties to her and her own entry into adulthood i enjoy the fa
1774,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,i went out on a limb with this one necromancers aren t usually my thing so i was pretty apprehensive but its pretty obvious right away that it isn t your average raising the dead novel its so much better everything from the coldly beautiful gates of death to the spooky reanimated villains wowed me sabriel is short and sweet and definitely worth the read i think its neccesary to highlight how downright awesome necromancer lore is sabriel comes form a long line of necromancers that have be
1775,Sabriel,Garth Nix,2,“does the walker choose the path or the path the walker ” this was not my cup of tea at all it took all of my mental strength not to dnf it first num ish pages were great but then it just fell flat for me if you liked this book good for you but probably dont read the next part because some serious rant is going to follow so what i did like the beginning especially the prologue it seemed this is going to be exciting high fantasy with amazing world characters and backstories ma
1776,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,rating num and how it hurts to give them of five i don t like fantasy novels much and this one was no exception i think the overuse of capital letters in a non ironic context is tiresome i think the willefull mispeling of wyrds to make them magickal is annoying and this book does both things the character sabriel was a dreary chit of a girl caught up in magick she doesn t understand ugh she has a familiar a cat whose name is mogget oh now really why are the servants always named som
1777,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,num/num/num after several years away from this series i m bumping this up to num num stars because it s just that stinking good the characters are wonderful the world building is fabulous i love the dramatic differences between the old kingdom and ancelstierre and i adore mogget more than i can say basically this is excellent with a side of teen years nostalgia num/num/num i read this book in high school when it first came out read it a few times throughout high school and haven t read it sin
1778,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,if i tell you that this book had magic zombies and early numth century technology i m sure your reaction will be wth but believe it or not the author managed to create a cohesive world that seamlessly mixes all these elements in a way that makes sense the first part of the book was a bit slow because it was mostly sabriel on her own but once she gets some companions a talking cat and a fellow mage things become more interesting mogget the cat is particularly witty and touchstone the
1779,Sabriel,Garth Nix,2,garth nix put a lot of thought into building the world of abhorsen i could tell he spent hours thinking out every part of the old and the new kingdom and that he loved doing so however he failed to instill any excitement over that world and its characters in me while reading i knew that the story had a well written plot but i didn t really feel drawn in like i usually do when reading a good book though the characters were rounded out and realistic i didn t connect with anyone maybe it s
1780,Sabriel,Garth Nix,1,i was looking forward to this book only because i ve read garth nix s keys to the kingdom series which i have to say is much better than this i unfortunately didn t like this book anywhere near as much as i d hoped i was let down that there wasn t much character development and that it s so difficult to read and eventually finish i feel like this book dragged a lot and ended up skim reading the majority of the book i very nearly put this in my dnf shelf and had to force myself to read it i
1781,Sabriel,Garth Nix,2,meh i ve been listening to this on the way to/from work as is my wont with audiobooks as i can t focus on them outside of that confined environment while tim curry does a good job of reading though i couldn t stand his moggett voice i couldn t get engaged in either characters or story sidebar this is my numth gr book though i think there really shouldn t be a celebration until i m up to the numth read book 
1782,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,even better the second time around especially with tim curry narrating it 
1783,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,i had originally rated this ya fantasy at num num but now find it a full num stars why the change the world this book creates is so fun to think about i m delighted that the goodreads com ya f sf discussion group is exploring this yarn as march s group reading it s nix s debut jealousy and while it can stand alone as it provides lovely closure it s also followed by two other books rounding out a trilogy which means i ll get to hang out in this world i love so well with characters so v
1784,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,sabriel takes place in two fictional countries ancelstierre a safe country sort of like early nums england where magic does not work and the old kingdom a dangerous place where the two types of magic charter magic good magic and free magic bad magic flow and where the dead refuse to stay dead and instead roam freely a wall separates the two countries the main protagonist is an num year old named sabriel who leaves wyverly college an all female boarding school she has known as
1785,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,i really enjoyed sabriel i didn t have any expectations going in and found it a unique and enjoyable ride set in an alternate early numth century england sabriel knows little more about the magical old kingdom across the wall than we do and we all have to figure it out while on the run towards unknown danger in a kingdom that is clearly falling apart as matters become more obviously serious we encounter the malicious dead not staying in death and sabriel s incomplete training as a necroma
1786,Sabriel,Garth Nix,2,it s got some flaws like very slow start but it s not entirely hopeless either that said i ve made it half way through and called it quits i ll second what susan said the heroine didn t have a lot to distinguish her and some of the plot elements seemed overused the prince thing really made me groan to those grievances i d add cat sidekick hehe hhahahaaa not funny sheesh a bit of a cliché way to cutesy and reminds me too much of anime crap the fact that it s not clear what
1787,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,i ve been on a bit of a fantasy kick lately and sabriel does not disappoint the world garth nix creates is rich and expansive it s darker fantasy and the treatment of magic is much more deep and interesting than shouting a simple expelliarmus sabriel is the daughter of abhorsen a man who is a good necromancer of sorts rather than raising the dead he puts them to rest it s a daunting task and abhorsen is the only one who can perform it sabriel finds out that her father is in troubl
1788,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,full review this book was well written and i can t deny that the second half of it was more interesting than the first but nevertheless i didn t feel a strong connection to the book i felt like there s little action but in reality the book was action packed it seemed to me that the story lacked emotional connection the colour and bindings that usually create not only good book but also a book that is a page turner i was left intrigued though about what happened and what is going to happe
1789,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,sabriel is the daughter of the necromancer abhorsen he has placed her in a school outside the old kingdom but she must return there to rescue her father who is close to death i did not care for sabriel who i found boring and without much mettle except the need to save her father on the other hand i liked touchstone who seems to have more personality perhaps from his earlier life and whose character developed as the book progressed i also liked the author s thin line between life and
1790,Sabriel,Garth Nix,1,it was a chore to read this book every once in a while it got interesting only to go back to a part that i had to slog through again sabriel herself wasn t very interesting the magic wasn t explained very well saying charter marks over and over again doesn t reveal a whole lot a friend of mine loaned it to me with high a recommendation and it was only because of her that i read more than a chapter or two even then i had to stop at about halfway through i simply could not force mysel
1791,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,probably not quite as fabulous as i remembered from my first reading a decade ago but still quite good i ll leave the rating at four stars certainly readable by fantasy fans who aren t into the typical modern ya scene like myself the world and the magic system are both unique and interesting it s dark and a little dry but i like that sort of thing it does make me want to continue re reading the original trilogy to see what i ve forgotten and moving on to the two newer books to see whe
1793,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,fantastic book i ve had people recommending this to me for ages so glad i finally picked it up the magical system and world was great but it was sabriel her competence prickliness and big heart that made this book extra special 
1794,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,i really liked this story good enough to go on with the series sabriel you re alive she says yes i am nope i wouldn t want to be an abhorsen sabriel can take the job lol
1795,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,again i blame this on being spoiled by writers who develop their worlds and their characters in detail but just enough that everything makes sense while this story is great what bogs it down is the narrative how short it is how the author skimps on the detail and in return makes the world building messy and disjointed i had to read the prologue three times after halfway through the first chapter because at one point we are left to think that the world is some quasi middle ages place an
1796,Sabriel,Garth Nix,2,a little disappointed by this one and not sure why it s as popular as it is i did really like some aspects but overall this was just a drag it took me forever to get through despite the fairly simple writing style sabriel follows sabriel what a surprise who inherits the position of the abhorsen after her father gets into trouble the abhorsen is basically a necromancer who works for good and banishes malevolent dead spirits back to death the magic system in this was really cool and i lo
1797,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,i’m not a fan of ya literature but i will read anything by garth nix his seventh tower series was one of my favorite books when i was a teen his writing is great and his worlds and magic systems are intriguing sabriel is no exception the story is set in a land almost like ours people use guns and many other forms of modern technology but necromancy and other forms of magic are used sabriel enters the realm of the dead in order to rescue her father along the way she meets countless dead
1798,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,the writing is nice the protagonist is great and the world building is interesting but perhaps because this is ya i found it lacking in character study/development for everyone except the protagonist and the franctic adventure pace led to the author rushing over parts which merited more explanation especially the ending at the end i couldn t help but think that if this book were written or re written by robin hobb it would be really brilliant 
1801,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,i knew a bunch of people loved this book but i was really relucant to read it because full disclosure i never bothered to look into it beyond the cover i assumed it was old timey sword sorcery fantasy with a dude protagonist and i was like no thank you but it turns out it s actually portal fantasy with a girl protag and her talking cat spirit being sooo it s great 
1802,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4, death and what came after death was no great mystery to sabriel she just wished it was the first time i read this book i did not like it and had to abandon it at page num now after having finished the whole thing in less than num hours i realized i hardly gave it a fighting chance and that wasn t fair because it s actually good garth nix surprised me in that all the objections i had about sabriel as a character are remedied later on in the book i have never been bored enough with a book to
1803,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,this took me a really long time to finish mostly because i just wasn t hooked until i was over num pages in sabriel is kind of the setup book it takes awhile to find your footing in the story and there are so many things going on and information to learn plot lines being woven in that will probably have more significance in the next books but the world was interesting and i loved the characters sabriel touchstone mogget they all had their own distinct personalities and i thought tha
1804,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,this is a good book it s a well told story it s a fantasy world that is at once familiar and strange it s mysterious if it has the occasional moment of well that s convenient view spoiler [mogget being the fourth charter would be one of them touchstone being of royal blood and as such being the first would be another were it not for the fact that i expected that the second sabriel brought him back from the land of the dead the other major convenience being when they suddenly realize t
1805,Sabriel,Garth Nix,1,i guess garth nix has a following but i personally can t see it the whole book felt in a word amateurish for one the dialogue was unwaveringly wooden so that the characters barely showed themselves and then only after many pages the description of the world was pretty but often overly ornate and adjective laden the bits of attempted romance were sudden and bizarre so i was working hard to stay in the story let s talk about the story though it s ridiculously convenient in every othe
1806,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,num num i really enjoyed this book it was a well paced and highly creative ya novel the system of magic is especially unique and interesting sabriel’s magical abilities are channeled through bells sound and harmonics are a strongly woven theme throughout the novel to me it was reminiscent of the concept known as music of the spheres i have only two criticisms of this novel foremost i was disappointed in the lack of character development in the main character while i was drawn in by plot 
1807,Sabriel,Garth Nix,1,just a ridiculous first novel i got a shock when i learned part way through the book that the heroine was eighteen she acts like a child of nine she continues this for the rest of the book no matter what obstacles she faces no matter how many chances she s given to learn the only time she s not acting nine is when she s crying over what she thinks is this hunk sidekick falling into bed with a tart she s still silly as hell though what was i thinking picking up this book in the book s de
1808,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,this was my very first fantasy book that i ve ever read and i m not sure that i ll be in a hurry to read another one i just found it quite hard to get into and at times i wondered if i would finish it sabriel is the daughter of abhorsen sabriel must journey into the mysterious and magical old kingdom to rescue her father from the land of dead although her journey begins alone she soon finds companions along the way such as mogget and touchstone who are powerful creatures of the the magical wo
1809,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,young woman leaves boarding school to enter the mysterious kingdom of her birth in search of her missing necromancer sort of father so i m like years late on this one but a decade later i would like to assure you all that you were totally right this is a great series this first book is a bit wandery in places – you can sort of see him figuring out what he s doing – but it has something i think it s that this series makes a lot of the usual moves – talking cat death of a trusted adult 
1810,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,i found nix s world where sabriel is born to step into death and enforce the boundary of death and life very intriguing the nine gates to death the bells that control the dead the different forces set to keep control over death mogget forced servitude sabriel s excursions into death all very vivid in my imagination it did take nix a while to get into the story and at times i was confused by his descriptions but when the story got intense i found myself very involved and anxious for sabr
1811,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,this was a great yarn i think of this trilogy as often as i think of harry potter in some ways i like it quite a bit more of course it s apples to oranges and harry potter rocks sabriel starts off dark though and the darker harry potter books are better according to me it could be because they are more developed sabriel starts off dark she doesn t take num years of hogwarts to get there 
1812,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,absolutely delightful i was really expecting this to feel like a teenage fantasyishesque story but i was pleasantly surprised sabriel was much darker than i expected and i loved every page of it add in a nice unique magic system and this makes for an enjoyable read that was easily strong enough to force me to read the rest of the books in the trilogy well done mate er garth nix 
1813,Sabriel,Garth Nix,2,sabriel is the daughter of the necromancer abhorsen and has magic like her father had been at a boarding school for most of her life she finds out her father is missing and now must search for him but danger awaits her i couldn t get into this book i felt like i couldn t connect to the characters 
1814,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,i loved this i was blown away by the magic system which i thought was one of the most interesting and uniquely designed that i seen in a while the world was exotic but believable and the story was just terrific definitely a new favorite in the ya fantasy genre 
1815,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,finally starting this here we go adored it 
1816,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3, let this be my final lesson everyone and everything has a time to die i didn t know a lot about this book when i started reading the series has popped up in discussions with friends over the years but no concrete details were ever given so i didn t really know what to expect i ve always just been told to read it while there were a lot of things about this book that i enjoyed including the world and magic there was also a lot that felt lacking sabriel was an interesting character and
1818,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,i enjoyed this book overall though i thought that there were some flaws in it not big enough to keep me from being very engaged and from feeling satisfied when i was done but enough to catch my attention and detract a bit still it was worth reading no kidding serious spoilers below you have been warned at the core this is a traditional epic quest fantasy novel girl on the verge of adulthood is thrown into great events and has to grow in order to overcome the great enemy she discovers
1820,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,august num num years later and this is still amazing january num i am so glad that someone recommended this book to me because it was a fantastic read i am a huge sucker for the fantasy and adventure genre as long as it s not downright confusing i admit that during the prologue i had a hard time following what was happening but other than that i knew what was going on the story starts off after the prologue with sabriel at her boarding school in ancelstierre after finding out that her
1821,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,i thought sabriel hit the ground running from the very first page but it took me several pages to adjust to garth nix s writing style i ve read other reviews where people mention having a hard time getting into the story and i think i know why not unlike tolkien garth nix includes a lot of exposition imagery in detail in his narrative unlike tolkien though nix doesn t explain everything in his fictional universe so as a result i spent a good portion of this book in a state of confusion
1822,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,audiobook performed by tim curry num when her father goes missing a young woman must leave her relatively safe boarding school to go up against the dead creatures who are threatening not only the old kingdom but all society what an extraordinary fantasy adventure i have to admit that when i began the novel i was struck by similarities to a certain young wizard – mark burned on the forehead at birth orphaned sent to boarding school just beginning to learn the craft of magic and up again
1823,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,[clears throat] [licks nutella from fingers] [puts lid back on nutella] [straightens] [clears throat again] i first heard about this series last fall from the lovely ladies over at epic reads [waves] i was kind of eh about this but i was jealous of their whole fun read along and everyone said these books were super good so i added them and thank you epic reads because this book was great this book is like harry potter meets berlin during the cold war meets early twentieth century meets the gri
1824,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,this was an enjoyable read but ultimately there wasn t a lot of substance to it the main character sabriel was ok but i kept comparing her to the discworld character susan sto helit the whole time the novels came out around the same time though pratchett s was released first and are very similar the daughter of death and i prefer susan so much more i also felt the world it was set in was very weak there were only small glimpses of the time period it was set i wasn t sure if it was supps
1825,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,i ve always loved sabriel and the world it introduces i like this trilogy more than the other garth nix books i ve read in general but sabriel might have been my favourite of the three because it can stand alone and i loved the characters of sabriel touchstone and mogget i loved all of the characters really even the ones we only have brief glimpses of like general horyse it s a good introduction to sabriel s world since she both knows enough that she s not completely over her head 
1826,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,i came into this book with high expectations because it is suppose to be one of the best fantasy series out there i am sad to say that this series may not be for me i didn’t hate this book but it was just okay and it didn’t move me in any way sabriel was a great character she was spunky determined resourceful and a bit standoffish i liked that she was layered but i didn’t connect to her and her plight as much every other character except her father was forgettable they did not leave a la
1827,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,sabriel is one of the best fantasy books out there full stop although not up to the deep literary analysis of tolkien s lord of the rings or pullman s his dark materials it is a realistic fantastical intriguing and thought provoking novel that s right up there with the best of them garth nix creates a dark almost gothic world that echoes with age and believability that is intoxicating to explore the magically imbued old kingdom that lies across the wall from the more scientific orientate
1828,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,this is a very solid young adult fantasy it s got some aspects that are unlike anything i ve seen and others that are more familiar but well done the characters are interesting and the evolving relationships thankfully more subtle than a lot of more recent books and a focus on necromancy for a book meant for teenagers interesting note the rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the changes in goodreads policy and enforcement you can read why i came to this decision here in th
1830,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,such a fascinating magic system 
1831,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,well this was an excellent first book i truly loved the world and story and already bought the second book 
1832,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,necromancy female lead certainty of death epic quests small chance of success why did i wait so long to read this book i first heard of ‘sabriel’ on my quest for female led fantasy i was probably twelve my interest faded after failing to find the book in local stores fast forward to a canadian used bookstore where i stumble upon not only ‘sabriel’ but the sequels to top that off the cashier gave me a discount so i could buy the whole set companion books burnaby bc very nice shop
1833,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,rating num num/num initial thoughts simply amazing given the book’s reputation i shouldn’t be surprised but the truth is i’m very surprised by just how great sabriel is i assumed mistakenly as it turns out that i had left it far too late in my life to read it in theory sabriel is a children’s story i don’t agree with that ascription now i’ve read the book so i had no expectation that i would end up reading one of my all time favourite fantasy novels but that’s what has happened at first glan
1834,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,i don t really have a lot to say about it so i suppose i won t be writing a super long review sabriel was mostly an okay read for me it mostly read like a num star book and there weren t necessarily any moments where i was like yes oh my god this is so good i liked the characters and story well enough with mogget being especially interesting but somehow this felt as if it was written like num years ago which it was but what i m trying to point out is the lack of timelessness aside from t
1835,Sabriel,Garth Nix,2,i am invoking the num page rule and giving up i don t do this often enough this came to me from book club and i do try to read a range of genres but it s a perfect reminder that young adult fantasy really isn t my thing any more i wanted to give it a go as this has good reviews but apart from anything else it s a series of five and i really don t need to embark on this particular quest i may have enjoyed it more if there had been some humour or if the heroine had a personality maybe th
1836,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,sabriel is classic fantasy book that has been on my reading list since num according to goodreads basically i knew i wanted to read it since i first read the blurb but for whatever reason i didn t give it the attention i knew it deserved until now having finished the audio version yesterday narrated by the fantastic tim curry i find myself wondering what was i thinking not reading this sooner what s wrong with me what is life gah yes this book is that good i officially have a
1837,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,finally getting around this series the beginning was overwhelming but glad it all came together by num it was heavy on the fantasy and gave me sanderson vibes i adored sabriel and can t wait to read the next installment ps so bummed about the cover changes 
1838,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,a phenomenal novel i can t believe that it has taken me this long to get around to reading it big thanks to my parents for getting me the trilogy umpteenth christmases ago loved the ideas behind the book and where the plot went all the coming of age shenanigans without the tropes delightful bit of necromancy sassy cats i m in love i might marathon the series 
1839,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,i’m surprised how much i enjoyed this and not even because of tim curry’s narration ok though a large part of my initial enjoyment was tim curry’s narration especially for mogget 
1840,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,this book has literally been on my tbr list for years it was an excellent example of sword and sorcery fantasy a genre i have never been that fond of this kept me interested and that is saying something 
1841,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,rating num num stars i am usually pretty generous with my ratings i will give a mediocre book num stars i rarely ever give a book a num star usually i would stop reading a book long before that happens i also tend not to give a whole lot of num stars either so i have a habit of rating books between num num and num num stars about num of all my ratings that is why i try to write a review for each book i read to communicate how i felt about a book because i could rate one book num num stars for a completely di
1842,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,read if you enjoy the blue sword or skulduggery pleasant possibly harry potter and the sorcerer s stone num num stars glancing through all my goodreads friends varied reviews i see i am once again playing catch up on an already popular novel and there is a good reason for its popularity sabriel is action filled story with an original fantasy world and cool characters it is very nums but that is not necessarily a bad thing in fact i found its style throwback and fun compared to present day ya
1844,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,sabriel is the first book set in the abhorsen universe and introduces us to the character of sabriel who is literally in the process of finishing at at her school when her father goes missing d the only catch being that her farther is the abhorsen who is a kind of good necromancer and as a consequence she has to inherit the job and travel into the old kingdom to deal with her father s disappearance and the evil undead that are looking to take over the world d the world building in sabriel i
1845,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,i discovered this book my senior year of high school when a couple of my friends in drama club were reading it having always been a fan of fantasy i ran to the library and picked it up although i remember being rather surprised that it had been published in num the harry potter craze was in full swing in num and i thought sabriel was riding on its coattails like so many books are still doing today but no not only is it incredibly original it is also unique and scary sabriel kicks some
1847,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,i have had this book sitting around in my bookshelf for at least five years because after buying it it never appealed to me to start it until recently it started off very slowly which is why it is only getting three stars because it wasn t really until half way through i felt truly compelled to read it however saying that the second half was really quite good and i would like to read the sequels sooner rather then later i have a feeling they will be better or at least i hope so there were a
1848,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,another book i really owe a debt of thanks to my dragons and jetpacks group for steering me towards as a book of the month the author garth nix hits a lot of great notes with this book the lead character is fun to read sabriel is a young woman suddenly shoved into a situation she wasn t ready for she makes mistakes but that makes perfect sense because she s so young and inexperienced the magic system is richly detailed and wholly unique and the world nix created is nicely detailed and cre
1849,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,you know how no matter how many times you have macaroni and cheese it s still delicious that s kind of how i feel about this series it was a childhood favorite of mine and occasionally coming back to it is like having a serious helping of comfort food for anyone who s tried fried chicken mashed potatoes and chocolate cake like ex tamora pierce phillip pullman and yes j k r and still has room for more i suggest this dish to fill up the corners basic plot sabriel is a necromancer 
1850,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,more reviews here readers live a thousand lives i adore high fantasy books so it’s kinda surprising i hadn’t read sabriel yet i mean this book has become like high fantasy legend so i really had no excuse i’m so glad i finally got to this one because it was a great read the characters and the story and the world were fantastic this is such hard core high fantasy and i absolutely loved that sabriel is an awesome heroine and i loved her she is so strong and resilient and determined she is
1851,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,num num because i didn t really understand some key aspects of the mythos this book reminded me strongly of the edge series by ilona andrews given that a magical medieval world old kingdom borders a technological mundane kingdom ancelsteire similar to england num however on the edge is more thoroughly steeped in the romance genre narrative while sabriel only includes a hint of romance it s a young adult coming of age fantasy involving necromancy and two forms of magic free magic and c
1852,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,sabriel is on the cusp of deciding between continuing her mundane education in ancelstierre or returning to the kingdom of her birth in order to practice magic then a shade appears with her father s voice and objects of office and sabriel s choice is made for her she has inherited the mantle of abhorsen and as such is the only defense against the dead pursued by creatures made of decaying flesh magic and an unending murderous thirst sabriel searches the old kingdom for the necromancer at
1853,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,i wish i would have read this book when i was thirteen my thirteen year old self would have loved this story i would have crushed on touchstone laughed at mogget and wished i was sabriel well not really i don t think i would have wanted to be an abhorsen shaking head nope i didn t read this when i was thirteen which wouldn t have been possible anyways since it was first published a year after i graduated high school i read it a few months before my numth birthday which is a fine t
1854,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,with the fourth full length novel clariel due to be published later this year i thought i d get reacquainted with the old kingdom trilogy beginning with sabriel the first book in this unique and spellbinding series follows sabriel a teenager who learns of her fathers impending doom from across the wall in the old kingdom a place rife with magic and dead things as she travels this dangerous landscape the quest conforms to the formulaic trappings of adventure fantasy accumulating loyal fol
1855,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,wow i did not see this book coming i guess since i had never heard of it and it s older i expected it to just be meh wrong this book is fascinating beautiful poignant surprisingly action packed unique and i could go on and on at first i couldn t help but feel like sabriel was like so many other stories with the necromancers the wall and the seven gates of hell but as she crossed into the old kingdom and we discovered the world together i was blown away by how ingenious everyth
1856,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,num num stars does the walker choose the path or the path the walker exceptional i really enjoyed sabriel when i first picked it up i thought it was a middle grade book the simplistic writing certainly made it seem so more but no this is a ya fantasy a great one at that i keep getting caught up in new releases that end up being mediocre so it took me a while to pick up this book that was published a while back i love you i hope you don t mind view spoiler [sabriel and touchstone s
1857,Sabriel,Garth Nix,1,i m not really one for craftily worded and deep fantasy s i like cool inventive stories but not the confusing and over abundant description that seems to come as a package deal with a fantasy novel sabriel was a novel that i couldn t click with it wasn t particularly difficult to understand vocabulary wise but i couldn t make the words sink in the sentences were so long and complex that i had to reread several times thus taking away any enjoyment that could possibly be granted i m part
1858,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,one of my absolute favorite books of all time it s so very very wonderful i reminisce about it quite often while its ya genre i don t think of it that way there s none of the usual ya stuff silly teenagers love triangles etc the heroine sabriel is mature competent strong brave admirable she s not fluffy besides sabriel the entire concept of the book is amazing it s morbid unique enthralling basically sabriel is a necromancer cool right she has to journey across
1859,Sabriel,Garth Nix,2,updated num/num/num i really tried this time i let my old disinterest go started anew and was still highly disappointed there were really good action scenes and had so much potential to be more i just found it completely lacking most of the characters were bland and the interesting ones didn t have enough page time to shine the ending was stupid and i didn t like sabriel s pov it would have been better to have a narrator and i know this is typically the kind of book i devour and love but not
1860,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,teen necromancer fights baddies in a weird split world where half the land seems to have early numth century level technology and the other half is a medieval magical kingdom where technology doesn t work pretty fun fantasy adventure story a bit old fashioned in some ways and ahead of it s time in others maybe a bit too fast paced for it s own good some of the big moments needed a bit more time to breathe i thought but it doesn t have that heavy portentous nonsense that bogs a lot of fantas
1861,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,though its premise may sound interesting i have a couple of problems with this book apart from the fact that the translation sucked sabriel the main protagonist felt like a num year old girl when she s actually num also i think it lacked world building and i didn t believe the romance either i hope it gets better in the next one a pesar de que este libro tiene una premisa interesante tuve un par de problemas con él dejando de lado que la traducción es malísima sabriel la protagonista p
1862,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,sabriel is at school in ancelstierre when she receives a message from her father that he is in danger he sends her his bells the tools that he uses as a necromancer to send the dead back where they belong sabriel must journey home to the old kingdom where magic works to reach her home and save her father but danger lies in her path and she doesn t know who she can trust sabriel makes her way north bravely wields her father s bells against creepy dead spirits has a magic cat like compani
1863,Sabriel,Garth Nix,1,the fantasy genre is almost always hit or miss and unfortunately for myself sabriel was another miss garth nix was commended by wikipedia for dodging the genre definining fallacy of extensive world building in place of actual plot i would agree nix does an excellent job of avoiding details about anything at all until the plot calls for it nothing is explained nothing means anything and so i finished the book feeling duped there is no story worth hearing between these covers / please don 
1864,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,i read this on david s recommendation i have to say that i enjoyed it but it didn t grab me to start with the worldbuilding was truly original but the heroine didn t have a lot to distinguish her and some of the plot elements seemed overused the prince thing really made me groan but this book really grabbed its fire for the last num/num the final confrontation with evil was nothing short of brilliant it was tight unexpected and riveting i couldn t put it down i ll definitely read the next
1865,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,it s a good book and i liked it full of adventures the orgin of fantasy genre ant not one of those fantasy books that can be found nowadays whick actually focus more on the romantic aspect and fit ya genre a lot more the only thing that bothered me was that it was written from third person narrative and for this reason i couldn t connect with the characters deeply and lots of grammar mistakes but i blame translators and redactors on this one after all i highly recommend it to all fant
1867,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,i really enjoyed reading because it has good characterization and lacks cliches i just find that it has lot of wasted pages which is annoying since it is short book but reading about sabriel and her adventures in old kingdom was such pleasure i can t give this book less that five stars if you hate mary sue and damsel in distress this is the book for you plot of this book is filled with dead and death and i thought i won t enjoy that but i fond it quite entertaining 
1868,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,this is seriously one of my new favorite books i cannot believe how much i loved it it deserves to be so much more well known then it is from the first page of the prologue to the very last word i was completely hooked i am going to have to get the other two books of the trilogy as soon as i can there are a ton of good reviews so i m not going to summarize it again besides you don t need a summary you need to read this book immediately 
1869,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,i own this book but this time through i listened to the audiobook it s narrated by tim curry tim curry his voice was perfect for this he did an exceptional job especially with mogget s voice i am not a cat person but oh how i love mogget garth nix created a world that makes me want to cuddle up in a big cozy blanket with a nice hot cuppa and just get lost in the pages 
1872,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,listened to this one for the second time recently because i needed to revisit a favourite where things are horribly stressful and yet shit still gets done love this book and garth nix s world building tim curry s narration of the audio is lovely as always 
1873,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,this one i read a year ago though i know it s been around a long time really enjoyed it dark inventive gripping with a dynamic heroine loved the world building and the magic system will definitely re read this one maybe even soon 
1874,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,i m not the biggest fan of straight up fantasy i personally have a hard time getting into a different world just a personal bias but pair tim curry s narration with some epic battling of the dead and you have a pretty good story on your hands 
1876,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,this is classic fantasy at some of it s best though i still had some moments of frustration 
1877,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,definitely a unique universe looking forward to book num 
1878,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,garth nix is a familiar name in the fantasy world and i first encountered him through the wonderful sabriel nix is a member of that amazing and fast growing collection of australian young adult authors and one i would love to meet as his worlds are so expansive and well thought out it would be fun to pick his brain about the creation process this was another of those golden selections for my old young adult reading group and we had so many wonderful conversations surrounding the intricate and
1879,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,finally a fantasy book that has a believable female main character where have you been hiding from me mr nix all these years sabriel is a calm young woman who knows what needs to be done she is utterly human and imperfect she isn t a typical badass one of the boys kind of girl who always has a witty comeback ready she just wants to save her father and she doesn t fawn over touchstone the entire book romantic love is just a side story it s amazing read this novel the story is dark
1880,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,why has it taken me so long to discover this series i love fantasies with magic that feels ancient in sabriel the magic is just that old hard to control and occasionally painful the old kingdom is separated from the rest of the world with a wall and the dead roam the old kingdom s roads the abhorsen has the duty of forcing the dead where they actually belong sabriel read like a beautiful cross over between harry potter and the earthsea series by ursula k le guin the world and magic s
1881,Sabriel,Garth Nix,2,num num stars sabriel and the abhorsen series are a classic and so many of my bookish friends have loved it so i wanted to give it a try num the style is really weird  it s not quite middle grade fiction but the character development wasn t ya caliber either while i didn t hate sabriel i also didn t love it heck i really didn t even like it it would be more accurate to say i endured it finishing only because i started very liberally skimming the endless paragraphs of descriptions and fights 
1882,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,num reading challenge a young adult novel it s fairly uncommon that i really like books labeled as “young adult” fiction too often they re silly teenage romances with a thin veneer of story slapped on and those set in speculative fantasy or science fiction worlds seem to lack a lot of oomph in the world building but sabriel is proof that sometimes less is more the obligatory teen romance is barely there and not handled with any of the usual annoying giddiness and moping likewise garth n
1883,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,this was kind of different than what i usually read but i m glad i read it it is kind of slow moving and there s a section where she s just traveling on her own that moved really slow for me but i did really like sabriel as a character the magic system is fun a little confusing at first but i did like it moggett was hilarious and probably my favorite part of the story i did like touchstone too he was sweet this was really probably a num star read for me but i think i just didn t apprecia
1884,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,a fantastic teen fantasy novel about a young girl assuming the role set out for her in youth to follow in her father s footsteps i always enjoyed garth nix books in the past but i was worried they wouldn t feel as compelling now i m older the novel was fast paced and very interesting i only wish there had been more 
1886,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,why did it take me so long to read this necromancy and a cat companion i also really enjoyed how awesome sabriel was 
1887,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,thoroughly enjoyed that complex magic systems terrifying demons an unapologetically girl as the lead and one magical cat with a grudge 
1888,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,it took me a while to get into the story but once i did i loved the characters and the world and i cant wait to continue 
1889,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,me crying at the end of this book yeah it was okay i m gonna wait a little while to listen to the rest of these because while i m sure they re good i know they focus on someone else and i m not ready to move away from sabriel 
1890,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,i really enjoyed the book it moved quickly and had the right amount of fantasy meets modernity blend to it i can see why so many of my friends loved reading this book i look forward to eventually continuing the series but i could also feel content to just read sabriel and call it a day because it had such a fitting ending 
1891,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,the beginning of this was delightful but raised high expectations that weren t really met by the rest of the book i was going to say that it s unfair to judge a ya book for lacking depth but there are a lot of ya fantasies that do much better it often read like it was intended to be made into a movie at times distractingly so and i think it would be very well suited for adaptation 
1892,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,it surprises me a little that this gets shoved into the teen category not sure why yeah it s a recently out of school num year old saves the world story questing for a parent in peril coming into her own identity as a chosen one with sidekicks and a mysterious oracle like helper yeah i guess all the tropes are there but the writing is just goooood it feels higher stakes than teen so much scarier than teen like why does pat rothfuss freshman in magic college story get she
1893,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,before the internet the way i found new books to read was very different if more simple i would go to the library or on the occasion i actually had spending money the bookstore pick every book up that looked even remotely interesting and take it home then i would read it i was in no way discerning about which books i would read this method had its downsides the biggest of which was that i frequently ended up reading books i didn’t care for all that much but at that point in my life
1894,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,i get why a ton of people love this book the magic system is incredibly well developed and fairly interesting i may not like magic that works by a system of arbitrary rules but i know plenty of people who read just for such things the plot is fast paced i may be tired of stories where the all of the conflict derives from the protagonist not having information that everyone else in the story has but again i am aware that this is simply one of my own person pet peeves and of course w
1895,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,num stars good start to the abhorsen trilogy liked the characters can t wait to read more books from the author 
1896,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,how does one do justice to sabriel a groundbreaking novel with world building that s hard to match i went in hoping to absorb garth nix s wonderful sense of place and time in his world and found myself loving the journey at every step garth blazed a trail for australian fantasy with this title which holds up today as a masterful piece of storytelling with a great sense of identity and poise 
1897,Sabriel,Garth Nix,2,spoilers after reading the reviews on sabriel i was eager to see what garth nix was going to offer me eager in a good way unfortunately it fell short of my expectations one of the reasons the book fell short was because of the characters themselves even with sabriel as the protagonist i hardly got to know her i understand that she was young and that she is venturing off into a world that she was kept ignorant of up until the disappearance of her father i understand that she that seems t
1898,Sabriel,Garth Nix,2,sabriel by garth nix awesome name by the way is the first in a series of fantasy novels for young adults it features the eponymous girl who is the latest in a long line of necromancers magicians who deal with death and getting the dead to shuffle around on this side of the grave only sabriel s clan is unique in that they specialize in putting the dead back down and protecting the world from them so when her father dies sabriel has to shoulder the mantle of his office until she can tr
1899,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,i read an article today stolen from another goodreader s page about how difficult it was to sell ya novels before the harry potter phenomenon the article said that harry potter and the sorcerer s stone was a huge hit at numk units sold in num not to malign a book that i thought was meh but hush hush a book many openly criticized for many different reasons has sold about numk units since it was released in num/num the genre is a lot different and much more popular than it was ten ye
1900,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,i was trolling around the internet looking for something to read after i finished the last in the harry potter series and philip pullman s his dark materials series when i read a review of the abhorsen trilogy by garth nix this trilogy consisting of the books sabriel lirael and the abhorsen received such high marks on amazon by adults and youth alike that i thought i d give it a try i have now read the first in the series sabriel and really enjoyed it i ve begun the numnd lirael and
1901,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,this is a re read except this time i listened to the audio version read by tim curry coming straight off clariel the latest in the series though set earlier in the timeline i can see that the author has improved clariel had me gripped more but this one is still very good the characters are i think the best part unless that s the setting sabriel has a clear driver for her actions a task she has to complete that s both important in the larger scheme of things and also personal to
1902,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,okay i m just going to say it male authors who write female protagonists usually do a crap job they just do it s not really their fault i mean after all they are men so what do they know about the thoughts motivations and feelings of the female character this was actually the main reason that i put off reading this book despite the many positive recommendations i got from friends who had read it well i finally broke down and read the thing and here s what i have to say wow i
1903,Sabriel,Garth Nix,2,i began this once a few years back and gave up right after sabriel first meets mogget this time around i was determined that i would enjoy this book for one reason it had such a great reviews that i thought it must be true and two because i found it boring when i was younger and my taste has changed quite a bit so that now a more tamped down story can hold my interest but this wasn t just boring it was dead that s how the characters felt when i read it dead non existent moving chess pi
1904,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,i like reading my books with absolutely no expectations i don t even like to know what they re about really i d much rather rely on the recommendation of a good friend i need surprise in my stories that much so when i picked up sabriel i had no idea of what it would be about i just knew my friend tricia put it on my list for the reading swap challenge was i ever pleased sabriel has spent most of her life at school learning enough magic that by her numth year she is able to perform some
1905,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,i can t believe this book has been in my life for almost num years it is fresh and evergreen whenever i read it this book is everything i want in a ya book mythos struggle humor a vividly realized world and the hero grows up you might not expect a book about a teenage necromancer to be about the appropriate time to die but this is about death and life being part of a continuum and the abhorsen is the necromancer of keeping things orderly the world and writing in this book are vivid and e
1906,Sabriel,Garth Nix,2,i ve only heard good things about the trilogy and i ve gotten the impression that it was a must for fantasy lovers here s the summary sabriel daughter of the necromancer abhorsen must journey into the mysterious and magical old kingdom to rescue her father from the land of the dead nah i wasn t impressed at the most it was okay i just couldn t get into it i would find myself unconciously skimming it before reminding myself that i was supposed to be paying attention i guess the fantas
1907,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,i think i m going to keep the rating of num stars though i might need to stew a little on it maybe num num sabriel is a great fantasy story one which i read previously and still wish i read when i was even younger sabriel is a story of a girl with a great/unique destiny whose father had to keep in ignorance for safety reasons as well as preserving the bloodline but now that the evil has been unleashed sabriel has been thrust into a world of the dead without much preparation and little training 
1908,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,i can t decide if this book was a num num or a num star read for me i m so bad at deciding these things sometimes the characters and the world is so beautifully written and explored and honestly i m hoping for more of both in the next books in the series yes i will num be continuing on with this series and i am excited to do so 
1909,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,i remember reading sabriel for the first time during a baseball game and being utterly enthralled my family enjoyed going to baseball games me less so thus i always went equipped with a purse full of books almost the next day i went out and bought lirael unfortunately abhorsen wasn t out yet when it came out i bought it in hardcover which i almost never do that s how good the trilogy is sabriel is a necromancer using her bells to prevent the dead who won t stay dead from running am
1910,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,i had a lot people recommend this book but i was pretty disappointed with it the world garth nix constructed was pretty interesting i can certainly get behind good guy necromancers who wield bells to patrol the gates of death sure why not but did no one tell the author that characters should have personalities oy sabriel was so freaking bland and so was touchstone and every body else the only character with any defining character traits was mogget and his cat like cat induced disd
1911,Sabriel,Garth Nix,1,frustrating sure necromancy is interesting but bad writing isn t i felt like i was thrown unceremoniously in the thick of things expected to accept everything the author dishes out the challenge for fantasy writers is and has always been creating a whole new universe with its own system at times convincing the reader that he just missed his own hogwarts letter in his numth birthday unfortunately details for nix mostly meant describing the changing colors of the sunset when a character look
1912,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,so happy surprise of all happy surprises tim curry clue rocker horror picture show etc love him was the narrator of this audiobook so that was wonderful and obviously he did a great job but this book would have been great even with a less distinguished narrator this is one of those books where they don t really do all that much world building they just sorta throw you in and explain things along the way for the most part i appreciate that although there were a few things that t
1913,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,i have read many fantasy books and i can say with certainty that this is one of those stories that stand out sabriel is a very unique interesting complex story like many other fantasy books it takes a little time to understand what is going on and really get into the story but when that happens you will most likely take a deep breath dive in and refuse to come out before the end sabriel is a young girl but she is an adult inside a strong female character is a gem she is not annoying o
1914,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,oops have to switch to the new fiery pretzel edition although the original cover is so much better and thank you g for that charming observation as for becker s contention that this new cover is trying to make the book more appealing to hunger games fans yes that makes a lot of sense since the fiery pretzel is reminiscent of the mockingjay pin yet comes up not at all in the book but man oh man this has nothing in common with thg i didn t fall over at the end of the book nor did my he
1915,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,this book pretty much wowed me i just started to really get into fantasy books last year and i have not read a lot of them yet however this one floored me i was impressed with the whole story i loved how it started off with her everyday life and them moved on to her trying to find her dad in death the adventures that she went on were just amazing as well as the friends she had made the world that she was in was described almost to the tee you could picture everything so clearly f
1916,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,opens with a prologue wherein a man has to save his newborn daughter from death and a necromancer and then to the girl herself about to graduate from school on the other side of the wall out of the old kingdom and where the magic is weaker though strong enough she is considering what to do after when a dark shadow appears carrying a sack it came from her father it brings the sword and the bells all magical he uses in his role as the abhorsen to combat necromancers and the dead 
1918,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,that was f cking awesome originally written in the nums nix s old kingdom series recently was republished as ebooks and last week i happened to be browsing my library when i came upon sabriel the blurb looked interesting so i picked it up and boy am i glad i got the chance to read it sabriel is a solid series starter the old kingdom setting with its hell creatures curses and myths reminds me of the demonata series by darren shan that i read as a teenager and reading this story with some sim
1919,Sabriel,Garth Nix,1,generic fantasy plot so generic i found myself staring at the kindle progress bar on every other page turn it tries to pack many popular fantasy plot devices in and creates a hodgepodge of slow paced adventure uninteresting characters and no real direction that s the main thing missing for me there s no clear purpose for the journey it s more of a companion gathering phase followed by a solving the problem phase the rules of the fantasy world s magic are introduced at awkward times and
1920,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,okay forget almost everything that you know about necromancers because sabriel does away with most of the conventions such as sabriel is a young woman not a decrepit creepo old guy her familiar if it can be called such is not a raven or a talking skeleton she uses bells to communicate with the dead and sometimes her blood so that s closer to the lore zombies are still zombies still i really enjoy nix s writing it s descriptive enough without going into tolkien esque levels and work
1921,Sabriel,Garth Nix,3,num num stars this was an okay story but i did get bored in places sabriel was an okay character but it was a shame she hadn t learned more about what it meant to be an abhorsen before she became one she did seem a bit naive in that respect but it was purely through a lack of education the storyline was okay but i got bored i often have problems with fantasy books and this one just lost me the pace was too slow and i just lost interest i actually keep wishing that the end would come quicker
1922,Sabriel,Garth Nix,4,num num stars i enjoyed reading most of the book some parts were rather dull and i felt my interest waning at those parts i really liked the necromancy and magic aspect the supposed romance happened way too quickly insta love again the person was too old for the main character num num the main character was a good character she is strong and intelligent which are qualities i really like in mcs she is also very selfless i loved the father daughter relationship too i guess the only setback this bo
1923,Sabriel,Garth Nix,5,for someone who doesn t read a lot of fantasy i was completely taken by this book it took me a little time to understand the world and how it worked but i was so taken by sabriel and her role as abhorsen that i just couldn t put the book down and then when we meet mogget the most awesome cat sidekick i think i ve encountered in fiction so far and so very very cat i was hooked although the romance at the end was a bit contrived and made me cringe a tiny bit i don t think it detracted fr
1924,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,i had tried to read this book multiple times in the past and had basically given up but i finally realised that i was attempting to read it the wrong way i was trying to read the silmarillion like i have read and reread lotr as a story an epic story of course but still a story now while the silmarillion is of course partially a story it is at least for me first and foremost a religious type document a biblical mythological account of the elder days of middle earth so this time i re
1925,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,ever since i joined gr i’ve been putting off the writing of this book’s review… but since i’m high as fuck on cold medicine i feel like i can do it so here suffer thru it along long time ago a little numrd world kid with an afro became fascinated of what he read on the internet about some british writer named tolkien… he wanted his books… it became his obsession… so he embarked on a quest to find his books and read the shit out of them… but alas the book was no where to be found on his dumb litt
1926,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,writing a review of the silmarillion is like trying to review the bible where do you even start there’s just so much story in here any attempt to convey it in a review would be to do the book a massive disservice there would only ever be enough space to talk about one or a few elements of the work so instead i thought i’d give my reasoning as to why every tolkien enthusiast needs to read this in order to fully understand tolkien the sheer depth of the work “it is said by the eldar that in
1927,The Silmarillion,J.R.R.

1928,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,the silmarillion is a must read for any tolkien fan it s filled with legendary characters great history and amazing places also beren and lúthien stares dreamily into space 
1929,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,buddy re read with shii i’ve been contemplating whether or not to tackle the challenge of actually reviewing this masterpiece for quite some time now in the end after having finished reading it for the second time i realised that i should at least throw out my thoughts on it so here we go… this is in my eyes the most impressive book ever written notice how i did not say “best” that was completely intentional i do not believe it is the best book ever written even though i know others think
1930,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,how to build a truly convincing fantasy world num it s all about the language make sure your world s language is convincing and you re pretty much there conversely if your language sucks then everything else will num your book can t include more than a few sentences in your invented language without losing your audience but it can include plenty of names so what people will really judge you on is the quality of the names the rest of this review is available elsewhere the location cannot be g
1931,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4, oh woe begotten spirit fall now into dark oblivion and forget for a while the dreadful doom of life i must admit i struggled though i love the lord of the rings and the middle earth universe with all of my heart tackling a large part of its history in this manner was tough going the world tolkien created is absolutely extraordinary without a doubt unfortunately the silmarillion is written as a long history or mythology of biblical proportions name after name battle after battle son
1932,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,sauron was become now a sorceror of dreadful power master of shadows and of phantoms foul in wisdom cruel in strength misshaping what he touched twisting what he ruled lord of werewolves his dominion was torment ah sauron maia of aulë—beyond doubt the singularly most enthralling antagonist whom i encountered as a young reader possessing all of the malevolence and dark charisma and naked power of satan but unhobbled by the multi aspectual morphology of christian theology and popular
1933,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,though i had many near misses with the silmarillion throughout the years having been introduced to tolkien s universe by discovering the hobbit in my school s library in numth grade i finally slogged my way through it during the summer after my sophomore year of college the first two years of my undergraduate degree were rather gruelling and i wanted more than anything else at that time to just read a bunch of books i wasn t required to read after making my way through the complete sherloc
1934,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,time for james’s unpopular opinion i liked this better than the lord of the rings before saying i am crazy hear me out actually if you have nothing better to do then read this review if you have then i gave this num stars so you know my opinion anyway see you can’t say i don’t care for your time silmarillion tells the tale of the making of the world by eru the god of middle earth and all that followed through the first two ages of creation up until the events described in the hobbit
1935,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,the whole day i have been trying to find the best words to use in this review but how can you find the right words to describe perfection this book was just a delight to read from start to finish the fact that a single man was able to create a fictional world with so much detail absolutely blows my mind you can feel the love tolkien had for middle earth in every word he writes the way everything comes together makes it hard to believe that all of this is truly just fictional there is so
1936,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,buddy read with the lovely karishma karishma you are the tolkien queen 
1937,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,the silmarillion is difficult to read and i don t think it is even meant to be read straight through like a novel another reviewer put it best when he said the silmarillion is like the bible it s the bible of middle earth it s the magical setting of the hobbit and the lord of the rings and it tells the history of the place the inhabitants the languages and the legends that came before bilbo and frodo for you ring fanatics you haven t finished the story until you ve read the history 
1938,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,the first fantasy book i ever read and still my all time favorite that said it s not for everybody it s been compared to the old testament and that s still the best analogy if you think that moses leading his people out of egypt is the stuff of grand drama then this is the book for you tolkien fan or not if you don t then you probably ought to give the silmarillion a pass no matter how much you liked tolkien s other work this is not lord of the rings plus it s quite literally the old
1939,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,buddy read with markus is this book really that hard to read no if you take it the right way this books was not written to make readers like an specific plot twist or character no this book is solely the recompilation of various tales that happened in the world where the lord of the rings was settled in from the beautifully written ainülindale and the creation of eä to the end of the third age and the fading years that being said you ll understand that it s not odd at all to find chapters
1940,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,in my humble opinion the silmarillion is the greatest work tolkien almost finished it is by far more difficult to read than the lord of the rings which i already expressed my love for earlier in the year after completing my re read or the hobbit but its greatness is found in the way it mixes together epic fantasy mythology and linguistics to create a grand tale of creation and destruction part of what i love so much about tolkien s entire middle earth story is that there is a cycle as to ho
1943,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,to me “the silmarillion” is the crown jewel of tolkien’s work – the silmaril if you will i knew the basic themes long before i started the book and after “the lord of the rings” i also knew that “the silmarillion” would be what i had been waiting for the concept was not only radically new in its time but is still unique in any given time frame a made up cosmogony and mythology well it always is of a made up world inhabited of made up peoples made up history made up languages etc ev
1944,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,i love messy elf drama super excited to kick off my tolkien re reads with this one i think i actually enjoyed this more the second time around it can be admittedly a little bit dry at times and i definitely enjoy certain chapters/stories more than others but i adore the world so it s always a fairly enjoyable read tbh i picked up on things that i missed the last time i read it it s just a little bit lore heavy so that s understandable also just about everyone has at least num num name
1945,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,a reread i read this the first time in april num during my second trip to london i ve been there many times since and do want to go again note this book is the prequel to the hobbit lotr books and if you haven t yet read those two the ending of this book has spoilers for both the book first parts being written down in num is divided in five parts the first two books deal with creation and prehistory then comes the main part which deals with the quest to get the silmarils plus var
1946,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,warning this book is for tolkien junkies only it is not for casual readers of tolkien not the hobbit was kinda fun wasn t bilbo cute sort of readers in fact i believe it might be prerequisite that in order to enjoy the silmarillion one must have read the lord of the rings a minimum of three times i am one such dedicated dweeb so i love it 
1949,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,1,this book was probably not the way to be introduced to the lotr world i d never seen any of the animated movies the new movies hadn t come out yet i d never even picked up any of the books then this book was assigned as part of the course i was taking the prolgue about the creation of the world was beautiful and amazing and it fooled me into think the rest of the book would be just as good parts of it read like the bible and so and so begot so and so and so and so the rest of it was
1950,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,it s not really a review more of an extra long recap way spoiler heavy links to each post are here heavy spoilers below look  here s the deal with the silmarillion if you re not a huge tolkien nerd you re probably going to throw your hands up in disgust swearing and tearing your hair out after the first two pages even if you are a huge tolkien nerd if you generally skip past the songs in lotr and the hobbit or can t handle creation myths you will probably end up like the people in th
1951,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,re read number num anyone 😂 enjoyed this re read just as much as the last one i love re reading books like this one because there are always gonna be little tidbits you pick up on more after a second or third lmao read something i only just noticed about this secondhand edition i picked up a few months ago there s a gorgeous giant map hidden away at the back definitely need to get this framed 
1953,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,final rating num/num stars so i finally finished silmarillion i thought it would take me longer than num days but i have never been so wrong what had driven me to read this was the movie adaptation of hobbit and since i have never read anything of tolkien before i decided to do it now d i am glad i did because this book is epic really epic and amazing the history of middle earth was full of tragic stories and tragic families and especially tragic love stories most of them ended tragicall
1954,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,i love this book more each time i read it full of tales of the history and cultures of middle earth it tells its own engaging legends and also adds depth to the hobbit and the lord of the rings the silmarillion contains greater good darker evil fiercer rivalries and vaster armies than those books tolkien a christian included many parallels to christian theology including themes such as god’s sovereign plan the consequences of pride the fall divine judgement and good and evil the
1955,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,my little sister just started reading this and was telling me about it i was surprised with how much i remembered from this book we talked about the characters at the beginning of the book the valar and maiar what each one s personality is like i still remember feanor was my favorite elf even though most people don t like him and the first heartbreaking friendship between an elf and a human and how awesome tinuviel was tolkien didn t just write stories he created legends it may be l
1956,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,the epic backstory and mythology of middle earth the grandeur and beauty of the language is a little like the king james edition of the bible but with much longer sentences its beauty is counterbalanced by its opacity i did sometimes have to recap to the start of a sentence or paragraph when i lost the train and of course many of the characters are referred to by two or more names but in the end it s the majesty rather than the detail that matters if you re expecting something like t
1957,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,legends of the elven people num november num sydney if there is one phrase that can describe this book and that it is an epic tale of biblical proportions in fact the style of the prose is as if it were written by an ancient historian but considering that tolkien was familiar with many of the ancient legends this is not at all surprising the thing is that this story in fact spans three entire ages of history and doesn t contain any single hero though there is one noticeable villain throught
1958,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,i love this book a a teen in the late num s i read the hobbit and the lord of the rings trilogy and to this day they stand as my all time favorite story ever i ve read them read them to my children and reread them to my self several times many times i have heard people say that the one thing that bothered them most about lotr is all the names places and history mentioned that they do not understand that is one of the reasons why i love the silmarillion so much even though it is not usually
1959,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,to be honest i don t think i ever made it through the entire book gasp but i m a tolkien fan and i had this crazy lotr obsession when the movies were released that i never really got over so yeah this book was still a win it s really dense but it s so full of fascinating back story it s like the bible of middle earth it s got all the good legends like the story of morgoth and of beren and luthien but it s got troves of other info as well so this is a must for any die hard tolkien fan 
1960,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,sil remains my all time favorite story many find it dry and antiquated i understand what they are saying but i see it in the light of being tolkien s true treasure trove without any of the bridge building anachronisms of lotr this is the core mythology of his creation and it generates the truest feeling of the faerie realm above all others [note for those who are set to read it for the first time i encourage you to get children of hurin and hold onto it sil covers the tales of hurin/t
1961,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,a lot of people complain about the complexity of this book but i think they just need to grow up and/or learn how to read more effectively i found it to be one of the best books i have ever read the back story it provided to the lord of the rings and the hobbit books was highly entertaining and the style of writing was so beautiful it could have been poetry i highly recommend it to anyone that can take something a little more complex but if you are a less advanced reader you might want to st
1962,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,as i ve just finished listening to the audiobook version of the silmarillion i thought to take this opportunity to review this volume of tolkien s posthumously published works which i first read num years ago i ll be posting this review here and with the hardcopy version of the book first off specific to the audiobook martin shaw does an excellent job of reading the only quibble i have is the opening and closing musical interludes which seem superfluous and don t really add anything to th
1963,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,note july num num i edited this review just now to correct a typo i d written gondor when i meant gondolin in one place pretty big geographical and chronological difference despite the similar spellings for once the goodreads description of this book and the breakdown of its constituent parts is quite accurate it may not sufficiently convey the fact though that what tolkien wrote in an array of handwritten notebooks going back as far as num while it lays out the basic back st
1965,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,3,the silmarillion reads like a foreign language history book in the modern sense it is plotless there is no single narrative with a main character to fall in love with or a satisfying conclusion this is the history of middle earth you ve been warned therefore this is easily argued as being for hardcore tolkien fans only if you are absolutely in love with the world the author created and wish to immerse yourself entirely in it put everything down and read the silmarillion all others shoul
1967,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,i’m somewhat dubious of my ability to review this work but i’m going to do my best the silmarillion is the work of tolkien’s most often viewed with apprehension by readers and i think the one most unjustly maligned it has the reputation of being the most difficult of his published works and i guess this is not without reason though i think it is often a position based more on preconceptions than due to the inherent value of the work itself i’ve read the silmarillion many times prior t
1969,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,read again oct num num eru bless this book for it is my bible until the great enemy returns from the void read from chapter num return of the noldor onwards if someone said to me that i could only save ten books this would be one of them i love this book i love it so much it s hard to express how much i love it this book takes me away to another place and time it s part of me i don t think a week passes without me thinking about it i constantly want to open it and read it it combines e
1970,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,the silmarillion is one of those books that i’ve meant to read for years literally it is according to some the book that separates casual lord of the rings fans from truly hard core tolkien lovers my first girlfriend confessed to preferring the silmarillion over the lord of the rings which she was unable to finish [info ]murpheyslaw likewise holds that the silmarillion is the preferable work being more true to tolkien’s desire to create an epic that the lord of the rings is or something
1971,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,better than i even remembered i need to re read the lord of the rings and the hobbit now then i need to watch all of the movies again 
1973,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,let me start off by saying that i thoroughly enjoyed my overall experience with the silmarillion so you might ask why not give it a perfect rating hopefully i can explain that in the rest of this review the silmarillion is a beautifully written book it is actually a collection of several works of j r r tolkien edited and combined into one book by his son christopher and published posthumously the five works combined in this book are ainulindale valaquenta quenta silmarillion akallab
1975,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,this book was spectacular it s not the kind of book that you sit down with and read for fun and escape but the kind of book that you read when you want something deep with fascinating world building and wonderful writing it reads very much like scripture which i loved that said it requires a different kind of reading than a fast paced fantasy that spans a shorter amount of time i can tell you right now that i did not keep all of the named characters and events and places straight in my he
1976,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,i first read the silmarillion when i was young and foolish well perhaps not but definitely young and unprepared for it i come back armed with a better knowledge of how to approach it it isn t a story in the same way as the hobbit and lord of the rings are it s closer to the myths that so fascinated tolkien closer to norse sagas and the old english beowulf it helped to see it in that way to approach it in the same way as i would a norse saga and i can t help but think that tolkien w
1977,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,2,oh god finishing this required strenuous effort sorry but i didn t enjoy this book it just wasn t what i expected i can totally understand why silmarillion is a favourite to others though tolkien is the master of fantasy after all contrary to the hobbit and lord of the rings silmarillion is something like an account of all the events during the numst numnd and numrd age lotr describes the events taking place during the last num decades of the numrd age using a goodreads friend s remark this b
1980,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,tolkien thought this was his greatest work and i agree in it he develops not characters but millennia of history and an entire cosmology as well as some very touch individual stories love stories really the simmarillion is really an acquired taste but so worth the effort and so deep 
1981,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,a must read for any tolkien fan this one lays out the foundations of tolkien s amazing world here are a few thougths on tolkien s theory and purposes when owen barfield read poetry he would at times come across a passage which would impress him very strongly it would cause what he called a “felt change of consciousness” as he began to make an in depth inquiry into this phenomenon it grew into an epistomology a theory of knowledge and meaning barfield was a member of the inklings and a
1982,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,wow i really enjoyed this book that s all i can say then again it really isn t a surprise since i m such a history nerd even a fictional history nerd rw ratings language num stars obviously since it is tolkien abuse num num/num stars there is some strained relationships between families due to umm drama like war drama lust num stars i say this mainly for the children of hurin section in case you are not familiar with that story the main plot revolves around this guy that has a y
1983,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,this is a good book offering a lot of insight regarding the history of middle earth and how the circumstances of the hobbit came to be i definitely recommend it for fans of the lord of the rings however some parts can be a little tedious and there are many character names introduced at once which i found confusing if i read it multiple times i think i would be able to follow the story better and get to truly appreciate the piece of literature 
1984,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,there are no words for this book it isn’t the lord of the rings because it isn’t in that category think d aulaires book of greek myths or rather the greek myths by graves because tolkien doesn’t go lite as d’aulaire does but this isn’t exactly a book of mythology either it’s a compilation and an unfinished one at that but what is there is epic and legendary and – i recently learned – soon to be made into a movie s but as pleased as i am to learn there is to be a movie s i know it/they
1985,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,3,num num stars reading this volume had the same feel for me as reading the old testament—it is the background material for a whole system of thought i guess that reveals my religious leanings—middle earth is where i hope my spirit goes when i die but seriously reading this historical background document to middle earth reminded me very much of a summer when i was a teenager when i decided to read through the whole bible with the thought that if i could understand the whole thing i might find somet
1986,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,a summary of this book would pale in comparison to what actually happens but i ll try my hand nonetheless these are the events that happened long ago in the history of elves and men before a hobbit found a ring before a fellowship was formed before a journey was made these are the stories of the creation of middle earth the gods and goddesses the valar of this world the beginnings of the elves and their glory days here in these pages reside stories of lust and greed of bravery and en
1987,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,this is not the lord of the rings it isn t even in the same genre and the difference is greater than with the hobbit and in the other direction though i will note that reading it will transforming a re reading of the lord of the rings a saga of the beginning of the world and the heroes and tragedies of the first age of the world many of them in places the style is distinctly summary oddly enough reading the partial versions as in beren and lúthien underscores it when i compare the mo
1988,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,where to begin this book was completely and utterly fabulous i absolutely love this book it stuns me with its awesomeness something i really love about this book is how it is written using very archaic language it gives the story a feeling of legend and reminds me of an old history it adds a realism to it makes it seem like more than just fantasy and to add to the reality of the story it isn t all fun and fluff and glorious victories and blazes of glories and happy endings view spoile
1990,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,this review will contain lots of fanart so be warned and some spoilers it took me a very long time to try and write a review for the silmarillion you can certainly compare it to writing a review about the bible because both books basically have the same concepts if you are a tolkien fan who only enjoyed the lord of the rings then this isn t the book for you this is a very dry read because the silmarillion is about the creation of middle earth and the first age this isn t something that you
1993,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,this book is huge in its narrative scope the only book i’ve ever read that is huger is the bible and the silmarillion is written very much like the bible it starts before the creation of arda and takes the reader through three ages to the end of the war of the ring there really isn’t anything like an epic high fantasy with a really solid judeo christian cosmology this isn’t a lewis style allegory by any means but the beauty that shines through the darkness of this story is unmistakable 
1995,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,of beren and lúthien being my favorite part in this one 
1996,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,3,so this was hard to read in just one sitting it took me several days to finish with this honestly i am glad that i did read this but it s definitely not a book i would re read again there were parts of it that put me right to sleep i think my favorite section was the third age tolkien definitely uses the bible greek and roman mythology as inspiration for some of the characters and events in the silmarillion i got a kick at first going oh this is supposed to be hades this is supposed
1998,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,i originally read the silmarillion shortly after it was first published in num and while i remember enjoying it i don t remember being terribly impressed clearly i am a different reader now than i was then this is an amazing book on so many levels and i actually believe that i have read it at just the perfect time in my life first i have always enjoyed tolkien the poet and this extensive mythology that he has created with the silmarillion just sheds ever so much light on his poetic inf
1999,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,1,j r r tolkien the silmarillion ballantine num in the sixties something changed perhaps mother church realized that people were turning away from her perhaps a cadre of teachers decided the younger generation needed to get in touch with its cultural roots whatever we ended up with a course in either the religion literature or both departments at many universities the bible as literature seems they decided that the definition of literature as it all too often is is something t
2000,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,reader beware the silmarillion is not a novel it s a history textbook however if you really love middle earth and must have more this is the next book for you to put it another way the silmarillion is prerequisite introductory reading for the aspiring tolkienologist if you can t handle it you had better resign yourself to the more comfortable position of lotr enthusiast the silmarillion will make you late for dinner for comparative perspective i tried and failed to read the silmarillion
2001,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,for the uninitiated the silmarillion is a history book of tolkien s middle earth the land in which the hobbit and the lord of the rings take place as well as many other works by tolkien most of them unfinished it s written in a very different style from his more famous works and i think a lot of people are put off by that i have to say that as big a tolkien fan as i am even i find the silmarillion a bit dry and repetitive at times for anybody who loves the hobbit and the lord of the rin
2005,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,3,this is one of those books that i m sort of surprised i never read sooner like back in the day when i was reading the lord of the rings or later when i went to see the movies in the theater multiple times or even later when i owned the movies both the fancy extended versions and the regular versions viewed multiple times i think tolkien did alright for himself but my experience with his writing has gone only so far as the lord of the rings then again i m not a huge reader of fantasy 
2007,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,loved this epic work but let me put it in perspective the hobbit is for children the lord of the rings is for adults and the silmarillion is for scholars 
2009,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,een erg uitgebreide nederlandse review vind je hier ahh i loved this so much it is not as easy to read as the hobbit and lord of the rings because there are a lot of characters and places with names similar to eachother i would mix up names when i was reading it for too long and i didn t want to miss anything so i read a few chapters each day instead of reading it for hours that worked great for me the story i loved the most was the one of beren and luthien i could read a whole boo
2010,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,unlike the hobbit or the lord of the rings the silmarillion is not a typical fantasy story covering thousands of years the silmarillion tells the story of tolkien’s universe from its creation to the end of the return of the king this is both the history and the mythology behind middle earth told in a high or baroque style that will endear it to some readers while putting others to sleep the trick to the silmarillion is to approach it as the author intended if you re looking for a novel
2011,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,i read j r r tolkien s lord of the rings in num and have prized it above all since then yet i didn t finish reading the silmarillion until num num years after having received the first edition as a gift from my freshman english professor all that i valued about lotr was multiplied tenfold by tolkien s history of the creation if eà and early ages of arda the world in which middle earth exists if you read the lord of the rings and particularly enjoy the sense of history that tolkien convey
2012,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,3,if you re planning on reading the silmarillion you must first understand what it is you re about to tackle it is not a novel it is the basis for novels namely the lord of the rings and the hobbit it is the telling of the creation and forming of the lands of middle earth it is written in such a way that had tolkien claimed to have found and translated it from a long lost ancient text some would have believed him you have to understand tolkien didn t write this book for the reader he wr
2014,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,now this is my favourite book by tolkien lotr is incredible but in my opinion the war of the ring just doesn t hold up to the stories inside the silmarillion the heroes inside these pages are so much more mythic audacious and awe inspiring than those of the latter age in the grand scheme of tolkien s regime this is middle earth basically what lotr did for me for reading in general this book did the same for the fantasy genre this is the book that really opened my eyes to not only the f
2016,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,notoriously hard to read if you re not a native english speaker or at least absolutely fluent but oh so worth the effort i m guessing it s not a light read even if english is your first language since it s written in a very archaic style even lotr was piece of cake with its not so modern language comparing with this one but once you get over the language barrier if there s one you find yourself immersed into the mythology of middle earth and you never want it to end or it s just crazy o
2018,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,i didn t expect to love this book as much as i did especially since it isn t in the expected narrative setting with a protagonist and a plot full rtc 
2019,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,the bible of tolkien’s universe there are a lot of mixed reviews about tolkien’s the silmarillion the book does not read and flow like tolkien’s narratives the hobbit and the lord of the rings trilogy it’s the style that is not appreciated and that is to be understood books are not meant to be written this way unless they are ancient historical accounts of civilization or ancient religious texts the story is a fictional religious and historical narrative for the universe of tolkien’s works
2020,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,the silmarillion is where it all began before the creation of the middle earth that we know and love in the lord of the rings this is where jrr tolkien gained all of his inspiration ideas for the construction of the numnd age and numrd ages of middle earth and it explains how throughout history it came into being it is the story of the first age of tolkien s world of ancient drama where it all begins and some characters that reader of lotr are familiar with like elrond galdriel appea

2022,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,if you love tolkien you will love the silmarillion if you don t you ll hate it this is not a novel best to approach it as an encyclopaedic history of the fictional middle earth it chronicles the elder days from the creation of tolkien s fantastic universe to the fall of the old elven kingdoms and the wars over and eventual loss of the silmarills while the children of húrin reads like a recorded legend the silmarillion is similarly atypical in approach—taking a detached factual tone ther
2023,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,num/num it appears i am through one third the book is dense and its nature is to make one want to pay as close attention as is possible so far i am impressed with the skill for continuance and weaving tolkien possesses here it is indeed something for those lovers of fantasy or myth or high olden language but it does in fact reveal characters to whom the reader may attach and not realize it until the story turns in some unforeseen emotional way the intricacy with which tolkien also gives p
2024,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,i didn’t enjoy it as much as the hobbit or the trilogy but it was definitely an interesting read that covered the history of middle earth through its creation through the lives and lineage of many elf houses and all of their battles with the enemy over the ages through to the end of the darkness in middle earth filled with lots of tales of heroism betrayal battles and the stuff of many the eldar lore and legend

2038,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,always wanted to read the silmarillion but can t seem to make it through read on a large part of the romance and epic feel of the lord of the rings is the sense that you are embedded in a larger story of which the current saga is only a part this feeling shows itself in many parts of the story with aragorn singing fragments of songs of the elder days frodo calling out aiya eärendil elenion ancalima as he faces shelob and various references to the revered west among many other examples

2045,The Silmarillion,J.R.R.

2060,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,2,an odd sometimes compelling and rather inscrutable background to tolkien s middle earth world it s not really clear what this book is about in many ways it s a history of the world in other ways it s a history of the attempts to defeat morgoth the original dark lord it s a history of the elves it s a history of the silmarils it is tempting to say that this book is not the story of anything in particular but is just a collection of different stories but that s true in just the trivial
2061,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,“all have their worth and each contributes to the worth of the others ” the silmarillion can be a tough reading as much as a wonderful one it reminds us that the greatness the dedication the passion and proficiency through which j r r tolkien built its world comes first of all from his immense talent and love for philology for words and languages to which he dedicated all his life from this book and love for words he started to imagine his world first he built a language an entire langua
2062,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,am i a true tolkien nerd yet 🤓 i’m still blown away by how much i loved the silmarillion i approached this book with a lot of trepidation as many people write it off as boring or difficult to read but in fact i think you must just expect not a novel but a history of the lord of the rings world so many of us at enamored of the “biblical” voice bothered me not at all and in fact rather enjoyed it it was an extremely condensed history so many novels could have be wrought from this if tolkien
2064,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,if i had to describe this book in one word i would kill myself because that would be cruel and impossible but this was a great book as with most prequels i m glad i read the hobbit and the lord of the rings trilogy before this one oh my goodness there were so many characters i can just imagine that meme with xzibit saying yo dawg i heard you like characters so i put characters in your characters so you can get really freaking confused okay maybe that s not how the meme goes but you
2065,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,i read this slowly over a long period of time and also enjoyed listening to the silmarillion seminars from the tolkien professor while doing so little things like understanding the origins of creatures like the balrog sauron the wizards dwarves and so forth added a lot to my enjoyment and understanding of lotr it does come off like old testament fan fiction but i found the history of the elves and the valar enriching and entertaining 
2066,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,i am going to attempt to write a review for one of the best books i have ever read and it is daunting but then so was reading it i read the silmarillion eleven years after i had read the lord of the rings one advantage was that i went into it with a fair knowledge of and love for tolkien s style so i knew i was not going to give up after reading a few pages as i had initially done with the lord of the rings but it had been far too long since i read the lord of the rings and in the int
2068,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,watch in amazement as i reduce the wordiest and densest novel of tolkien s to just five words it s all about that bling p elves and their bling are nearly as bad as a certain dark lord and his bling but seriously one of the greatest things about lotr and to a lesser extent the hobbit is that middle earth is a fully realized world it feels real because it has depth it has history and tolkien understands how to use language to give the various peoples their own traditions and beliefs and p
2069,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5, english isn t my first language so please excuse any mistakes the silmarillion is the story of the first age of the world concerning mostly the elves and the valar gods of sorts the preface how the earth was made by the gods is actually a different text but christopher tolkien saw it fit to be included in this edition of the silmarillion since it explains everything since the very beginning this and the valanqueta the description of the gods was a bit tough for me to read since
2070,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,the is one of the most unique and the most difficult to explain book i have read recently i loved the book but it s after many tries of finding the best way to read it this is what the readers should do if you can consider the hobbit and the lord of the rings are real legends then think this as the non fiction source to those legends which is discovered by you after learning the legends one must read this like we read the bible or the history books and why wouldn t anyone dislike either
2071,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,i have read this book at least num times i had been avoiding it since it came out in num i always really wished tolkien had written more but i could not get into this particular book about num or num years ago i started reading tolkien criticism particularly verlyn flieger s splintered light and john garth s tolkien and the great war which warmed me to the silmarillion about num years ago i listened to the silmarillion as an audio book while i was working on a long stained glass project

Tolkien,5,this is by far my favorite tolkien book i still find the atmosphere of middle earth fascinating in some way and i don’t think this happens often to me for things i loved when i was a kid i suppose this is simply my “comfort reading ” one thing that was cool is that in the first and second ages elves and men lived on the same earth as their gods only separated by a sea these gods were tangibly real some of them even marrying elves and spawning a progeny so for once it isn t a matter of beli
2073,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,1,i feel almost blasphemous giving this book a bad rating but i seriously did not enjoy it tolkien did a great job crafting a mythology for his fantasy world but he did a horrible job creating characters this reads like a history book or a compilation of legends rather than a fantasy novel characters come and go with such frequency that there is not time for development there were several shorter sub stories that could have been expanded to be novels of their own but zooming through at the p
2075,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,3,i have no idea how to rate this book i feel like i have a split personality regarding it on the one hand tolkien is a freaking genius his stories his worlds his way with words are all astounding they re so rich and original and just good if i were rating the stories the plots the silmarillion would get hands down num stars no questions asked on the other hand it s flipping hard to read the characters have such similar names and they change their names so often it s really reall
2076,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,it doesn t matter how many times i read this book i love it every time this is the story of the world of middle earth long before the forging of the one ring it contains the history of the valar and of the elves along with the war for the silmarils it is their history of the beginings of their world and the powers that be it contains triumphs and sorrows and deeds of valor later story tell of the coming of men and how they aided the eldar in their war against morgoth it also tells of grea
2077,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,this book is not for everyone but it is most certainly for me i used to go back and forth on whether i liked this more than the lord of the rings usually it just had to do with which of them i was reading at the time so i gave up trying to rate them against each other so many great stories that hit you in the gut or blind you with splendor i wish i could paint with words to a tenth of tolkien s ability most recent read it still amazes me every time i read it it is better than i rememb
2079,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,j r r tolkien was a genius and there is no doubt whatsoever about it his worldbuilding skills were phenomenal as was his imagination and what is most surprising is that even his books on the fictional history of middle earth are read with avid attention i m sure i didn t pay that much attention even to real history and may i just draw your attention to his writing it s so beautiful powerful and moving 
2082,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,2,i didn t like this book but that s basically my own fault considering i don t like tolkien s style of writing but decide to try anyway i can t give one single star because tolkien is great at world building but as for the rest meh 
2083,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,a wonderful book i only drop it to num stars as it s a little or quite a bit harder to follow than the trilogy follow the tolkien background to the stories we all know a version of the creation story and the history of the pre history to the war of the ring 
2085,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,wonderful simply wonderful read at a slow pace so you can digest everything will lead you to loving the lord of the rings even more

2091,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,as i ve just finished listening to the audiobook version of the silmarillion i thought to take this opportunity to review this volume of tolkien s posthumously published works which i first read num years ago i ll be posting this review here and with the hardcopy version of the book first off specific to the audiobook martin shaw does an excellent job of reading the only quibble i have is the opening and closing musical interludes which seem superfluous and don t really add anything to th
2092,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,i think it almost goes without saying but yep i loved the silmarillion tolkien s dedication to world building his eye for beauty at least at three levels physical relational and theological his grasp of how good stories work and his simple wisdom about creature nature all work together to make this one of the best books i have ever read i know i know it s not the hobbit it doesn t read quickly but there are books worth reading slowly and this is one of them i would suggest find
2093,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,so i m finally done this book is amazing but since it s a story collection and there is a lot of repetition and infodumping it s so hard to keep up with so it was fun and entertaining but also at times i was just like okay thanks for the geographical lesson i still have no idea what you re talking about some things i learned tolkien is such a nerd i mean i knew that but being a nerd myself i could recognize themes and his places of inspiration and it s just great every modern fa
2094,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,after reading the lord of the rings lor in original english i thought it could be not more difficult to read another j r r tolkien book but i was wrong as a native german speaker it took me month to read the lor for the silmarillion it took me nearly the same amount of time there are very few pages comparing to the lor but to understand all implications all connections all names you need time i started three times anew and read the full book calculating all double readings of page
2095,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,how do you even begin to review something like the silmarillion it s an epic in every sense of the word a religious text that explores the lore of middle earth in a way few fantasies have dared to match tolkien is the original grandmaster of the fantasy genre and in this collection of stories he brings to the table some of his finest work as a huge lord of the rings fan it was impossible not to love this book exploring history beyond that of the war of the ring the silmarillion doesn t hold
2096,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,2,mother it is over i ve finished the evil has been defeated as a fantasy fan it seems lacking that i ve never read a tolkien work i attempted to in middle high school but i could only get my hands on the french version of the two towers and my french was very lacking then i think i didn t even make it through the first num pages after that painful defeat i never attempted any book of tolkien s again especially since i liked the movies enough but am not passionate about them 
2097,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,3,thank iluvator i actually found tolkien s books in the order that they were published if this was the first book i d read i might never have read the hobbit or lotr this was a reread for me so i opted for the audio book the narrator martin shaw was very good and brought a storyteller like quality to the experience which for me was perfect for this book i m going to give it a three star rating i liked it but unlike the num stars i gave the hobbit and lotr i didn t love it when i first read
2098,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,it has been a while since i have read anything by tolkien but as usual he never disappoints from the first page of the book he weaved his magic and i was once again transported to middle earth he has such a gift for writing and storytelling you feel like you are there living and breathing the story no wonder the man is a legend his imagination knows no bounds from the poetic location names to the wealth and personalities of the characters especially in this version as i listened to the audi
2099,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,the silmarillion is not an easy read but on the other hand i don’t want tolkien fans who might be interested to be unnecessarily scared away from it i definitely had a rough start the first time i read it but eventually it won me over i followed along with the silmarillion primer at tor com during this reread and i highly recommend it it’s intended for first time readers and does a great job of explaining things focusing on one chapter at a time that said avoid reading the comments at
2100,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,the silmarillion may be the most difficult book i ve ever read and likewise the most difficult review i ve ever written it s incredibly dense and filled with so much information and so many stories that a proper review would be quite long in essence it would be like reviewing the bible to which the silmarillion is often compared and that would certainly be no easy task nevertheless i have tried and this is the result i imagine any reader of j r r tolkien s lord of the rings or the hobb
2101,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,3,first off i would not have made it through the silmarillion if i hadn t been doing a chapter a day read along of the hobbit and the lord of the rings through a group on litsy a chapter each day was more doable and the fact that i was doing it with others helped when i likely would have decided it was too deep and too much detail for me so many people and places to sort out coupled with the unending battles and death of practically any character i could grow to care about that being said th
2102,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,i loved this book and probably is one of my favorite books of all time the in depth story telling of tolkien and the beautiful threads that he weaves through it blew me away the start of the book is a but slow i will agree however once it starts to pick up it is fantastic the story of beren and lúthien is worth the read alone and couple that with everything else utterly amazing definitely worth the money to buy it and i would contend that the stories of middle earth will become classic
2103,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,good stuff here by the tolkien s only reason for a num star rather than num was that the genealogical nonsense up front got to be a bit much for me however i feel like this was a well developed higher view of middle earth and the world around it giving life to epic struggles hinted at in the lord of the rings books/movie and delving much deeper into history before that many of these stories could be further developed and expanded upon in novel or movie form 
2104,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,after num months i finally finished this book it was a long way to finish one book but it was worth it and it wasn t even that long if i compare my effort to get my hand on it in the first place i first knew about the silmarillion after finished lotr in num yes it means that i m one of tolkien fans because of the movies by peter jackson at that time i never read any books in english and knowing tolkien writing in both lotr and the hobbit i wasn t confident enough to read it in english and
2105,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,i feel like a hero after having read this book it s absolutely genius that he has come up with such detailed world history of this world and all its characters however it felt like tolkien needed to write num books for each epoch because it was too many facts and stories for one short book and i felt overwhelmed and sometimes bored 
2106,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,i was always told the silmarillion was dreadfully boring and could only be read with great perseverance this couldn t be more wrong i really loved to read all the lore of middle earth from its creation to the departure of the elves from it although all tales are summarised mostly the epicness seeps from it a must read for anyone interested in me lore 
2108,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,you have to be concentrated on every single page but it s totally worth it 
2109,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,there aren t really words fantastic enough to describe the silmarillion tolkien is the god of fantasy and this book is his bible 
2110,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,such an amazing story stories that lift the word epic to a whole new level makes the brilliant lord of the rings seem like just one minor episode in middle earth s grand narrative interspersed reading this one with listening to the unabridged audiobook read by martin shaw which definitely added to my enjoyment of it this time around 
2111,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,legendary num
2113,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,the silmarillion is where it all began before the creation of the middle earth that we know and love in the lord of the rings this is where jrr tolkien gained all of his inspiration ideas for the construction of the numnd age and numrd ages of middle earth and it explains how throughout history it came into being it is the story of the first age of tolkien s world of ancient drama where it all begins and some characters that reader of lotr are familiar with like elrond galdriel appea
2115,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,4,there s no getting around the fact that the silmarillion is a difficult book the first time i tried it after reading the lord of the rings i was completely flummoxed that s because unlike tolkien s other epic fantasy works the silmarillion isn t really a novel in the usual sense of the word there s no character dialogue and events are not recounted in a blow by blow retelling so there s no sense of immediacy and no easy hook to immerse yourself in it i really got the silmarillion once
2117,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,i ve been avoiding this book for years convinced i wasn t up to the challenge of the dense mythology of tolkien s world and the unmanageable thicket of elven names and lineages but i was taken completely by surprise by the fact that the most difficult aspect of reading this book was also what made it so worthwhile and that is how deeply sad it is the efforts of elves and men to keep evil at bay are so moving not because they fight with such courage but because the outcome is so often tragic 
2118,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,wow tolkien sure knows how to put the story in history the silmarillion is a prequel of epic proportions going way way way back in time to tell the tale of the very formation of middle earth and its peoples middle earth s very history while the simarillion can t really be compared to the hobbit or the lotr books it certainly is awesome in its own right and i would definitely recommend lovers of lotr to pick up the simarillion though definitely read the simarillion after the latter wo
2119,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,this vast history of middle earth is an ambitious volume that attempts to compile the notes of j r r tolkien in a mythic and elegant form the language is poetic written in a style similar to the old icelandic edda the silmarillion contains none of the comforts of the modern novel no point of view characters and very few prose devices rather the narrative is sprawling ambitious and written in high language it is possibly for this reason that many readers of fantasy forgo this tome in
2121,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,once i wrote a review of the silmarillion in my head i ll probably always do that it is a perfect book there are not many perfect books it makes me understand the term divine inspiration it has the ring of truth to make such a perfect work which transcends art or myth making an author was needed who spent all his life paying attention to how people make stories and what makes a story important it needed a writer who never ceased listening and learning the silmarillion had to be done
2122,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,an absolutely amazing book the best and most fascinating treatment of predetermination and freewill in a work of fiction i know of tolkien incorporates many mythological stories and influences in his story and comes up with a rich narrative that begs close study corey olsen s silmarillion seminars published on his tolkien professor podcast http //tolkienprofessor com/lectures/ have been invaluable to me i would listen to a chapter of the silmarillion then listen to the corresponding po
2124,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,2,angrod son of finarfin was the first of the exiles to come to menegroth as messenger of his brother finrod and he spoke long with the king telling him of the deeds of the noldor in the north and of their numbers and of the ordering of their force but being true and wisehearted and thinking all griefs now forgiven he spoke no word concerning the kinslaying nor of the manner of the exile of the noldor and the oath of fëanor king thingol hearkened to the words of angrod and ere he went
2126,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,i did it i finally got all the way through i guess third time s a charm and i actually really really liked it it s definitely for the more determined and nerd like tolkien fan as it s much less of a narrative than the lord of the rings which is unsurprising seeing as it wasn t really meant for publication as such one of the things i loved is the way one event builds on the ones before it sometimes there would be a story or passage and i would think yes that s nice but why is th
2127,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,5,i m not even going to pretend to be objective about this i realize the silmarillion won t be for everyone it won t be for most people it is not a novel or a short story collection it s a book of myths and legends of middle earth written in a sort of king james biblical prose the tales range from the creation of the world and the rebellion of melkor/morgoth of whom sauron was merely his chief lieutenant through the rise of the peoples of middle earth elves dwarves and men and great wa
2128,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,i know of no author in all of the english language who is like peake or who could aspire to be like him his voice is as unique as that of milton bierce conrad blake donne or eliot and as fully realized i am a hard and critical man cynical and not easily moved but there are passages in the gormenghast series which so shocked me by the force of their beauty that i snap the book shut overwhelmed with wonderment and take a moment to catch my breath i would drop my head my eyes would se
2129,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,a thing of beauty like the words it contains carefully bound with sumptuous illustrations i m often wary of pictures in adult books but peake was a painter and illustrator as well as a writer so i make an exception in this case he sketched in the margins of most of his writings as he wrote artistic symbiosis two of my three favourite books plus a third i’ve learned to like in one volume with an excellent introduction by china mieville and sebastian peake s note about the illustrati

2133,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,rotting shadows and incongruous beams of light are what i remember most from this novel if you can call it that incarnation would likely be more accurate characters are merely spectres generated by the stones of gormenghast castle the fragile mind of the author had descended just far enough to see the music in the movements of the grotesque pieces we cannot bring ourselves to look upon months after reading this i m still not entirely sure what it is that i took away from gormenghast th

2136,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,as of late whenever it is cold and inhospitable outside preferably raining or snowing i become a wanderer of long corridors and twisted stairwells of crumbling roofs and jutting turrets of cobwebbed dungeons and cavernous cloisters i descend into the fathomless depths of the imagination with author mervyn peake one of the fathers of the modern fantasy genre peake is little known outside literary circles his masterpiece the gormenghast trilogy was published around the time of tolkien’s
2137,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,one of the great hermetic works of literature a complete and total world unto itself almost to the point of detaching from the earth and assuming its own orbit if it were to do this it would be a strangely barren world however a barren world of endlessly ramifying imagination an almost airless world a world both vast and microscopic these books this world induced a tremendous sense of mental claustrophobia in this reader yet all these years later i still long to return to it

2140,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,the gormenghast trilogy is as close to perfection as literature can be it is unique sublime whimsical moving weird surprising otherworldly and written in shimmering velvety voloptouos prose wonderful beyond belief no amount of imagery sumptuous voluminous sensuous or rapturous can even begin to describe the delights of peake s masterpiece a true triumph of language and imagination

2143,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,a beautiful example of the fantasy genre done right mervyn peake built a realistic world full of evil gentle quirky fasinating unforgettable characters the brightest of them all is steerpike the protagonist in titus groan and gormenghast a delisciously evil mastermind we love to hate view spoiler [also the tragic character of fuchsia will break your heart hide spoiler ] in my opinion the third novel of the trilogy titus alone wasn t as interesting as its two predecessors but over

2145,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,3,one of the more pernicious aspects of epic fantasy is medieval stasis even as we celebrate the freedoms made possible through democracy we revel in escapism to an inherently oppressive setting where hereditary titles are standard issue and the plot often involves helping a rightful heir regain the throne this is but one of the many tensions that arises in mervyn peake’s gormenghast or titus books the eponymous castle is a grand affair in its own right but it is the locus of a much grande
2146,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,there is much to say and peake used an awful lot of words himself the writing is sometimes of shakespearean quality at other times you will think of dickens and poe sometimes punches are delivered with overwhelming power other times a scene is build up so elaborately and slowly it makes you wonder if time has indeed stopped at well over num pages excluding all the extras you are starting a long journey i made a few pit stops on my way relaxing with some less demanding books and i advis
2147,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,not to be compared with lord of the rings but appreciated as its own distinctive universe owing more stylistic debts to carroll poe dickens and a touch of kafka mervyn peake s world of gormenghast is a dark and bizarre fairy tale without the fairies or more aptly a tale of grotesques once i gathered the rhythm of the prose i couldn t escape the sprawling labyrinth that is the castle centerpiece of the first two novels titus groan and gormenghast nor did i want to which is why i as so
2148,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,the gormenghast novels by mervyn peake the castle of gormenghast is an immense rambling structure made up of meandering corridors countless courtyards towers libraries attics and underground passages — there are as well vast regions the author leaves unexplored and it is more than likely the inhabitants have forgotten they even exist if this were not enough there is another tremendous landscape across the rooftops within this remarkable building the groan family and its servitors enac
2149,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,one reviewer once quipped that gormenghast reads like dickens on crack a statement which perhaps accurately describes the weird wonderful and whimsical world of gormenghast from the cantankerous flay to the machiavellian steerpike to the lachrymose lord gormenghast and the eccentric doctor prunesquallor the cast of characters who populate the novel only serve to accentuate the outlandish and grotesque drug addled atmosphere which pervades the novel not only this but the reader s sense
2150,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,mervyn peake’s the gormenghast trilogy titus groan gormenghast and titus alone published between num num was originally conceived as a four or five book series but the author died after the publication of only the first two books the third having been reconstructed after his death from his notebooks in this work peake created a locale and story almost hallucinogenic in atmosphere internally consistent but sufficiently phantasmagoric as to seem dreamlike fantastic twisted and bizar
2151,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,2,got oh maybe num pages into this and couldn t get excited about it so i gave up i have repeatedly been told of the mastery of this book perhaps i just wasn t in the right mood in general i do go for dark and intricate and elaborate but i just couldn t make myself care about this world or its people i couldn t get into the right suspension of disbelief mindset kept having intrusive thoughts like wait where do the inhabitants of this castle get food from or wait i ve seen trul
2152,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,forgive the cliche but there just are not enough stars for this trilogy this is a masterswork about a fantastic world in a village in a castle this is fantasy that owes absolutely nothing to tolkien not that i m putting him down lotr is fabulous if one thinks of middle earth as a macrocosm then goremenghast is a microcosm think of dickens intoxicated with the english language writing a gothic fantasy and you get some of the feeling i have read this book num times and i am sure i will
2153,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,i d call it shakespeare for the lord of the rings set did i just write that peake s imagination is otherwordly his descriptive talent is singular his language does remind me of shakespeare or a particularly eloquent philosophical writer or something the first two books are the best concerning a dying feudal society and the leadership thereof the monarchs have been forced through layers and layers of tradition that no one remembers the reasons for to exercise complicated daily rituals a
2154,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,i reviewed each book in this trilogy separately but this was the actual edition i read overall i easily give the trilogy num stars even though the last book did not have the same setting and characters as the first two and so i couldn t help but rate it slightly lower this edition includes numerous critiques and essays which have been interesting to read so far 
2155,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4, i am tired of your words said titus i use them as a kind of lattice work said muzzlehatch they hide me away from me let alone from you words can be tiresome as a swarm of insects they can prick and buzz words can be no more than a series of farts or on the other hand they can be adamantine obdurate inviolable stone upon stone rather like your so called gormenghast you notice that i use the same phrase again the phrase that makes you cross for although you have learned it
2156,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,and so finally for me at least the world of gormenghast the great gothic fantasy of dickensian characters vast engines of ritual and excitable melodrama and amazing names the first thing is the writing words upon words upon words like brick upon brick sentences wringing imagery out of language constructing the inconceivable brooding edifice the endless twisting warrens and halls and rooms the towers and battlements and crenelations painting huges canvases of coloured landscapes and

2158,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,i m honestly not sure what i can even say that would convey the brilliance that is this novel uh oh words are failing me hmm i guess i need to think about it it s without a doubt one of the more original novels i ve ever read it s atmospheric charming devastating heartbreaking heartlifting horrifying fascinating must i get out a thesaurus it s brilliant this particular edition covers the three books that make up the trilogy that peake himself wrote titus groans gormenghast a
2159,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,i own nearly every iteration of these novels including the most recent reissue which i adore but i picked up this edition again this morning and just fell into it from the introductory essays by quentin crisp and anthony burgess to the opening scenes i cannot even begin to tell you the number of times i ve read these stories they live inside me not just because of their intense baroque imagery but also because of their nearly flawless diction the words are precise and stunning the w
2160,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,if you re into stuff like this you can read the full review painting in text the gormenghast trilogy by marvin peake i consider it pointless to compare tolkien and peake you might as well argue whether raymond chandler is better than ivy compton burnett i would only point out since i believe no one has so far that in gormenghast unlike middle earth sex exists i also think peake fits into the gothic tradition in literature – it is surprising that a book containing no magic or mythologic
2161,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,the castle itself is an entity the plot spirals deeper and deeper into its psyche the characters are both complex and symbolic lady fuchsia is my patron saint less formidable yet sullen as her mother and as incalculable is titus sister fuchsia sensitive as was her father without his intellect fuchsia tosses her black flag of hair bites at her childish underlip scowls laughs broods is tender is intemperate suspicious and credulous all in a day her crimson dress inflame
2162,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,ok i admit i got a little over whelmed num pages in and still have to read the last novel in the trilogy titus alone i have never read anything like titus groan and gormenghast it is hard to describe so i wont just to say i have never read such an organic novel most novels you can see the scaffolding how everything is put together mervyn peak s characters are all in full colour and complete individuals peak just gives them a place to play i only noticed once in num pages character
2163,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,first off this review is for the gormenghast trilogy one book i would give this epic num stars if it wasnt for the last book in the trilogy titus alone it just doesnt fit in with the rest of the story and i actually skimmed through it because it felt disjointed to me however the first two books in the trilogy titus groan and gormenghast are well worth a read weird yes but if you like engrossing escape fiction set in an imaginary place and unknown time with no mythological creatures
2164,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,2,i found this book used for num it s a beautiful edition weighty with creamy pages it will undoubtedly cut an imposing figure on your bookcase the washington post book world review suggests that many readers consider it the true fantasy classic of our time i wonder who those many readers are as a caveat i ve yet to read gormenghast and titus alone so maybe it s best taken as an entire oeuvre but after reading titus groan i don t feel i have the stamina to make it through the next to
2165,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,3,i ve only read the first novel titus groan and i certainly understand why these books have such rabid fans but i doubt i ll ever be one of them the writing is admirable rarely has a world been so vivid in my mind and in such a distinctive style reading this i saw the story unfold like an animated movie created with jagged quill pen drawings this vivid style also applies to the characters who are as distinctive as dick tracy villains mervyn peake is a genius when it comes to naming his
2166,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,2,amazing how many num star reviews admit to not finishing the trilogy and that the last novel is essentially illegible grade inflation i suppose readers are apparently supposed to overlook the plodding plotlessness because the characters and descriptions are so uber incredible or something but the characters are mere stereotypes and cartoons the obese drunken chef pedantic chief servant the dreamy romantic num year old girl etc and the lack of plot has much to do with how lame these characte
2167,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,one of my favorite books i ve read it several times i have the three book in one edition so it reads like one big story steerpike is one of most endearingly horrible character in literature he s an anti hero who almost becomes heroic gormenghast itself is mythic in its creation this book is about everything added note on the last reread i don t think the last novel works as well as i used to with the first two novels just a thought on another reading i realize how much steerpike is jus
2168,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,how do you review a book that can t be compared to anything else one of my favorite books of all time titus groan and especially gormenghast are outstanding titus alone is a strange sequel that probably was influenced somewhat by peake s progressing disease still worth reading bizarre fantastical gothic symbolic surrealistic beautiful peake s language is superb some of the most gorgeous prose to read 
2169,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5, titus groan gormenghast titus alone
2170,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,surely the gormenghast trilogy is not for everyone the characters are exaggerated and unreal but this is part of their beauty they are so distilled and concentrated that each allows us a glimpse of a reality beyond our own the whole gormenghast estate is so baroque so beautiful heavy and twisted it s almost like being wrapped up in a great dusty velvet curtain it is a place that could never exist in this world but perhaps some of you like me recognise a similar place within their own
2171,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,an incredible work of mythic narrative and world building a second read after many years uncovered many new laywrs and insights my adventures in the ballentine adult fantasy series continues 
2172,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,it took me a long time to fully immerse myself in this work until about halfway through the second book mervyn peake s prose is so dense as at times to be suffocating necessitating a pause in which the reader can come up for air and reorient themselves he writes like the bastard love child of emily brontë and lewis carroll a heavy weight of gloom and atmosphere but with an eye for character and above all humour occasionally seeming like a small boy who can t quite believe he s getting a
2173,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,holy moly why didn t those of you who had read this emphasize to me how good it is peake s trilogy is occasionally compared to tolkien s but i think unjustly it s fantasy and multi book there s a fourth posthumous volume of the series which i have yet to read but in a moment the reason but the resemblance with lord of the rings ends i believe in those two rather general and obvious common grounds peake s work is after different quarry it s gothic dark deeply pessimistic about the
2174,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,for all of its longueurs and faults and clumsinesses the gormenghast trilogy is incomparable an extended act of verbal and visual imagination that goes beyond anything else with a cast of characters that are never mere grotesques and often heartbreakingly alive i have to give it five stars because it taught me how to read utterly immersive and always oddly real even at its wildest extremes what makes the trilogy really special and not just a gargantuan wallow in baroque excesses of lan
2175,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,absolutely loved these books somewhere around a num num for me it would have been a num except it wasn t finished and i think if it had we would have seen more of our beloved gormenghast here are my reviews for each book titus groan gormenghast titus alone titus awakes
2176,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,perhaps the most neglected of all fantasy masterpieces these books defy easy description but the language characters and setting are utterly unique and beautifully described not for all tastes but highly recommended 
2177,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,3,have the trilogy as one book so will review as we go along titus groan num stars starting with the birth of our titular character and ending at his earling every word of every sentence in between feels lovingly crafted and makes up a thing of exquisitely dark beauty set almost exclusively within the grounds of gormenghast the huge and brooding castle which shapes and consumes the lives of its many mostly extremely eccentric inhabitants bound as they are to adhere to centuries of obscur
2178,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,admittedly i have only so far finished titus groan the first novel in what was expected to be a num part series only num of which are contained within this edition but it was interesting enough that i intend to embark on the second novel soon note however that i was not particularly entertained and sections of the novel were really tough going at times the prose is highly descriptive and peake peppers his sentences with archaic adjectives often the author spends a couple of pages describ
2179,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,an amazing read from beginning to end i will re read these books for the rest of my life this is the edition my library had it features a great and scholarly foreword by anthony burgess author of a clockwork orange but it should really be an afterword as it gives away most of the plot points of titus groan 
2180,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,the cover of my copy of gormenghast makes several comparisons to tolkien s work though tolkien is one of my favorites i never thought that comparison was entirely fitting it is true that both gormenghast and lord of the rings are heavy prose full of beautifully crafted language i would argue though that lotr relies much more on plot gormenghast is almost nothing but character study at least in the first two novels and peake made his characters so vibrantly grotesque that doing a single c
2181,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,i was late coming to these books i found a lot of my colleagues had read them at school but i recall we had prester john and king solomen s mines however i consider this collection together with lord of the rings to be the crème de la crème of fantasy fiction evil and good battling throughout all of the books and what incredible characters mervyn peake has obviously used his past experience of war to create and draw situations that are unbelieveable and credulous at the same time cou
2182,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,that rare beast that is not only as good as its storied reputation but somehow even better i ve read a theory that places all modern fantasy as descending either from tolkien howard or peake and while that s obviously a gross generalization i can see how this work is every bit as influential as that of jrr and two gun bob and better written than either everyone s right about the third book unfortunately but there s still plenty of great airy bits in there along with all the chaos i t
2183,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,i haven t written a review for this combined edition but if you have a little time i would invite you to read my reviews for book num and num of this series which incidentally were my favorite ones and probably in my top num reads ever here are the links for the review of gormenghast book num and for the review of titus alone book num 
2184,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,ah gormenghast what a gem the plot is gripping macabre gothic weird and the characters are brilliantly conceived i read these first as a post grad student with my best friend we would come back from being out get into bed if she was staying over and each read our copy of one of the novels didn t get to titus alone for some reason and coo with pleasure at the dreadful steerpike swelter or the countess of groan an absolutely amazing read for anyone who loves fantasy 
2185,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,3,this gothic castle trilogy is rich and detailed you ll feel the cold in this highly charged castle as a bizarre array of characters perform a bizarre array of acts the richness after a while does make it challenging and it really is all scene and no summary so it does take a patient reader i admired parts of it and feel as though it s probably better to dip in and out of rather than read straight through you ll marvel over a few pages read at random 
2186,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,the outstanding quality of this trilogy is its uniqueness the pace is slow the atmosphere byzantine and gothic if peake was thinking of another writer or of another style i have not read of it nor have i encountered it as regards content the first two books constitute a continuous narrative if you like the first continue to the second the third volume is almost entirely different as if it had another author 
2187,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,one of my all time favorite books only serious readers should even attempt it it has some of the most fabulous long drawn out descriptions ever mr peake was an artist as well as a writer the book has some truly odd little drawings all through it 
2188,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,3,i thought it would never end 
2189,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,it shall ever remain one of the most deeply influential books i ve ever read mervyn peak was a tragically short lived genius 
2190,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,i had to look up words multiple times hot 
2191,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,wow what a monumental trilogy only the mind of someone like mervyn peake could conjure up such a fantastical gothic picturesque series of incredible texts the whole series has an alluring feel to it it sucks you in almost immediately to a fantastical world apart from ours full of winding corridors gothic masonry and grotesque strange characters this world is so wonderfully realised it is hard not to feel like you are in the castle like you have stepped through a painting and while th
2193,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,the gormenghast trilogy consist of the novels titus groan num gormenghast num and titus alone num these are not short stories but at times very goth and scary the gormenghast series ended tragically with the death of peake at the young age of num from parkinson s disease titus groan is the name of the first novel in the series and its namesake character although peake measured out a long list of fascinating characters in the trilogy while still a child titus succeeds to his rightf
2194,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,i just finished the gormenghast series and it broke my heart originally intended to me much longer it was cut short and to this day remains both acclaimed and forgotten by the death of it’s author mervyn peake i listened to these books on audio spellbound often better than spellbound overwhelmed by the descriptions of a castle unmeasurably large gormenghast arguable inspired by china’s forbidden palace the castle is so vast that no one living within could ever explore the entire of i
2195,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,amazing last read this over num years ago this is a restored edition similar to heinlein s stranger in a strange land in which quite a bit of material whole chapters have been put back plus over a hundred illustrations of the author s so a great fantasy classic there is nothing else like this nothing you can compare it with you could say if you combined charles dickens tolkien bradbury downton abbey leguin and edgar allen poe you might get a similar writing style there is horr
2196,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,picture downton abbey directed by terry gilliam long but very well written trilogy that details a royal family and series of eccentric characters with most of the action occurring in a castle and its surrounding grounds found this book in a neighborhood little free library box and so glad i decided to take it home with me first book in the trilogy is very good second was excellent and the third which supposedly was written posthumously became a bit of a slog at the end if you re looking
2197,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,took longer than expected to finish thanks to some distractions but it s finally done the rating is for the novels alone not going through the included critical assessments great stuff though i foresee myself reading them all again 
2198,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,i first tried to read the gormenghast trilogy soon after i d seen the tv series around ten years ago back in high school i failed i was frustrated by the language and the pacing and quit after the first num pages i sold my edition a decade later i reacquired it during a purchase binge that overtook me at a manchester bookstore and ultimately led to some issues with luggage weight limits when i was returning home it s a classic i figured i should at least own it soon thereafter i was fac
2199,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,i once heard that there were three grandfather tomes to modern fantasy lord of the rings the chronicles of narnia and gormenghast by mervyn peake as years went by i often heard the first two mentioned in the same fashion or being praised by readers of fantasy in a more general manner but the third remained a more hidden gem having now read it i can understand its lesser status but hope that this mistake will be corrected as i have now joined the ranks to whom this stands as a mileston
2200,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,2,finished titus groan it was interesting enough to keep me going but skipped the last two there didn t seem to be a story to follow or at least not one to keep me interested 
2201,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,i’ve wanted to read the gormenghast trilogy for many a year and now that i have completed it i know that if i was to suddenly drop down dead i would die happy it’s that much of an achievement i thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it especially the first two novels even more remarkable for me anyway is the fact that i actually read this within three weeks averaging one volume a week whilst reading other books this vintage edition is complete and unabridged with the original illustration
2202,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4, two out of three as meatloaf sings ain t bad he might well have been referring to the gormenghast series the first two books were absolutely amazing when i first encountered them i d never found anything like them i still haven t the third was one of the worst books i ever read there are however reasons for the extreme drop in quality the gormenghast series is quite wrongly called a trilogy in fact it isn t a trilogy is deliberately planned to be told in three parts w
2203,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,3,many reviews claim that gormenghast is unique in the fantasy genre and never followed up on successfully purposely neglecting the odd third part which is in most parts not connected to the other two the uniqueness is mostly a matter of scope it s not a sweeping epic but rather an intimate play in the claustrophobic atmosphere of the castle gormenghast the main line of action of the first two books is the rise to power and subsequent fall of the former kitchen servant steerpike by ways of intr
2204,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,[upon completion of titus groan] this series has gone beyond many of the expectations that i had set if only because it plays against all of them i knew that our main character titus groan would not yet be num at the end of the first novel but i had no idea how mervyn peake would work that through he does overuse many phrases repetition is a horrible crutch when writing long paragraphs but in the end it all feels necessary to reinforce the mood of stagnancy that fills the castle and makes
2205,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,2,oh you guys gormenghast was nearly the death of me i dragged myself through that book like a small ragged mouse wounded in battle with vile scorpions drags himself across the burning sands of the desert the sun beats mercilessly upon his small furry head he can t open his eyes against the glare and he leaves a tiny pitiful trail of blood in his pathetic wake as he searches in vain for a drop of water and for shelter from the circling vultures now that you have some idea of what readi
2206,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,why don t more people talk about mervyn peake his writing is simply fantastic and i feel lucky to have found him that being said titus alone is not my favorite but i m still happy to have found my way here titus groan and gormenghast should be on everyone s must read list 
2207,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,i loved this book but man was it cumbersome at times mervyn peake was an artist prior to becoming a writer and he has the artist s eye for detail in his fiction expect long protracted descriptions of settings and cartoonish characters that are borderline barking mad it s best suited for nighttime reading what isn t and a strong sense of patience and melancholy adventure the castle itself gormenghast is the lead character of the first two books it s described as an impossibly large ancie
2208,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,2,titus groan and gormenghast the first num books in the trilogy deal with the goings on in gormenghast a crumbling palace building the size of a small city the inhabitants of which live in accordance with prescribed rituals and precedent the reasons for which have been forgotten steerpike a boy from the palace kitchens determined to improve his lot begins to manipulate his way up the stratified society into this volatile situation titus groan the numth earl of groan is born well writte
2209,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,warning this is a sloooooooow book really slow slow like molasses slow so you can savor it in the back of your mouth and brain if you want a book whose technical mastery is secondary in your priorities to the plot this is the book for you if not for the love of god stay away fortunately i m in the former category and i can hardly describe just how well this book is written even if it takes the plot a whole novel to really get some steam going this is truly epic characterization and wo
2210,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,mervyn peake is guilty through and through of loving alliteration and adjectives preferably combined quoting m de norpois from in search of lost time it s that nonsense of stringing together fine sounding words and only afterwards troubling about what they mean but despite or because of that flaw peake is incredibly good at creating moody scenes vivid characters who you probably wouldn t want to meet but enjoy reading about gormenghast as a whole is a brilliant example of weird
2211,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,one of the greatest fantasy trilogies ever created the characters are as monumental as the sprawling castle itself what i found significant is how interesting it all was because there is so much fantasy that suffers when going into description there is an air of mystery and the ancient in place during all of these novels that doesn t really have a comparison to anything else i ve ever read the last novel was unfortunately written while the author was literally going insane it is one of th
2212,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,i still haven t read titus alone the third book which is supposed to be very different and which peake never got the chance to properly finish titus groan and gormenghast conjure up a unique labyrinthine fantasy world with few if any fantastical/magical elements we re presented with the sprawling half ruined castle gormenghast and its surroundings that seem to exist in total isolation it s inhabited by grotesque characters whose stratified ritual governed society is inspired by british ar
2213,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,2,i gave up on this book after num pages you d think you re hooked enough to finish the book but somehow this wasn t the case for me i struggled to get through the first num pages and the idea that there would be over num more to go left me with so much reluctance that i decided to give up and start something new when i first found this book and read the reviews i was immediately curious peake was compared to tolkien in many of the reviews and as a lotr lover i therefore almost felt the
2214,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,this is an incredible book because the trilogy really is one book in three sections i think actually the third book titus alone was never finished peake had parkinson s and died before he finished it but that s probably okay because spoilers once titus leaves gormenghast the heart kind of goes out of the whole project gormenghast its labyrinth of tradition and corridors is the absolute centre of the first two books it does take some getting used to the syntax is often technical
2215,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,like all the other reviews say peake s descriptive power is out of this world num percent sure that you ll never read anything similar it s really really weird but if you re a fan of the unexplainable of myth horror or fantasy all wrapped up in a pretty gothic package eat your heart out it s like the author climbed into my head and teased out every dream and fantasy if i could i d be handing out paperbacks by the bucket load to random people passing by dr prunesquallor and mr flay
2216,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,3,if charles dickens decided to write fantasy novels he would probably write something like gormenghast although frankly i think peake is a better writer than dickens they both write outrageously long novels that detail dark sooty and unpleasant people and places they both introduce new characters that it s hard to invest in after num pages or so with the old ones the characters have odd names that vaguely insinuate their personality peake is also more lyrical in his writing sometimes swa
2217,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,i am about two thirds of the way through the second in this eccentric but wonderful trilogy i had thought when i began reading it that my days of appreciating fantasy novels were long gone and i admit it was a bit of a slow start now i can t wait to see what happens to titus the young earl of groan who lives along with a cast of bizarre and wonderful characters in the amazing castle peake s very visual descriptions of the characters like the duchess and her herd of white cats are riveti
2218,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,1,when i first announced that i wanted to be a fantasy author at age num or so i was given a copy of gormenghast and the lord of the rings and between them they nearly sent me scurrying into science fiction i hated gormenghast with a passion usually reserved for kidney beans i found the language old and pretentious the characters just ridiculous beyond the point of caricature and i was somewhere in titus alone before i decided that there was no plot to speak of and if there was i had clearly m
2219,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,1,i hardly know how to rate these books the tone of the book is entirely negative even the positive ending each character seems to be the personification of the most negative of human traits although the first two novels imply a static medieval world the third novel reveals an alternative modern world beyond the castle the motivations of the characters are not plausible i suppose one could say this was done on purpose for artistic reasons the plot is trivial even comic when i finish
2220,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,2,like gormenghast castle these books sprawl filled with meandering passages forgotten wings ornate baroque prose studded with superfluous crenellations unused unnecessary and in my case mostly unread i made it to page num but to be fair at least num of those pages passed by my eyes unfocused and ignored i skimmed skated and slid through long long long so very long descriptions of things almost entirely unrelated to the plot or even any of the characters i wanted to like this a
2221,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,i re read the first two parts of this every couple of years or so the first time i read it was back in high school right after finishing lord of the rings someone recommended it and i started it thinking it was more of the same completely wrong despite the mass acceptance of lotr i really enjoy these books much more the mood the curious characters the life of rules or the rules that govern their life the castle the ending of gomanghast the prose itself resonates with me one of my key
2222,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,2,i read the first num of these books and really didn t like them they did remind me of dickens a lot and i m not a big fan of dickens either so that might explain it all the characters were grotesque caricatures and the general mood was claustrophobic banal and depressing i d expected to really love these books from what i d heard about them but i was disappointed maybe it was just my state of mind at the time i don t know i did really love the concept of the endless castle but the
2223,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,3,great descriptive novels you really really get to know the characters more than nearly any other series i have read very dark not quite fantasy novel about the ruin of the ancient gormenghast family and their dependence on ritual and routine to keep their sorry kingdom going peake does a great job of letting us inside the characters heads but as great as these novels are they are very difficult reads and i have failed at completing them twice now though i appreciate them better each tim
2224,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,mysterious strange incongruous cunning scary fantastical this book is unlike any other i have read so vivid in description that i found myself believing it in it s entirety even though i knew at each moment that the world i d entered into wasn t real gormenghast is spectacular in it s decline it s characters magnificent in their strangeness not for the faint hearted but not completely inaccessible this book needs space give yourself plenty of time to read reflect and continue and y
2225,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,3,i really dug these books as an adolescent when i had more of the root and branch sour and cynical worldview they purvey i found them hard slogging on a revisit and put down titus groan after ten or so chapters it bugged me more that the characters were all caricatures their physical and mental eccentricities engraved with great precision and inventiveness but choking any sympathy i might feel for them 
2226,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,3,i wasn t really successful in getting into this book until after i saw the bbc s serialised production num of gormenghast which really helped me to visualise and get my head around the most peculiar world of gormenghast this is a text of a huge and remarkable imagination as an aside the poem the frivolous cake on pages num num is a great performance piece 
2227,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,my num year old self adored these books reading them required frequent dipping into my dictionary but i loved the painterly language the weird knotty characters and the sustained crepuscular hello mood i read out the opening paragraph to my english class and they were all wtf but screw them i ve re read the series several times and maeve peake s unofficial sequel 
2228,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,this is the only book i have really struggled to read however when i finished it i found that i really enjoyed it even if it did take me num months to read fantastically gothic twists turns and utterly brilliant characters i would definitely read this again even if it is huge 
2229,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,2,this book is simply too difficult to read at most i could read num pages at a time before my eyes glazed over there is a lot of good stuff here but i m not sure if it s worth the effort to slog through to it 
2230,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,i enjoyed the first two books and hated titus alone save for the last paragraph the setting is the best part of the book the endless rotting castle with its oppressive traditions and pointless rituals the characters are quite good as well with steerpike and flay being very memorable 
2231,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,in a nutshell books num num stunning monumental etc book num mad as a badger on a bouncy castle appropriately 
2232,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,1,whose idea was this awful schlock bored me to tears in the first dozen pages i kept trying but it got no better 
2233,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,1,couldn t finish this one the writing was rich and clever but the pacing just way too slow 
2234,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,loved this but not so keen on titus alone first two books brilliant and glad i finally read this after it sitting on my bookshelf for num years 
2235,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,amazing book essential reading for all i m not too sure why there was a third book but whatever all i know is that my imagination hurts d 
2236,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,if you like the literary equivalent of a maze carved out of a briar patch with a very tiny knife this is the series for you 
2237,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,almost perfect fantasyland long before fantasy became the thing 
2238,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,gormenghast is a massive tome a book with twists and turns reminiscent of the castle of gormenghast itself with enough characters to satisfy a fan of tolstoy or dickens this book is unique in the fact that i had not heard of mervyn peake or the gormenghast series before although this book is compared to the works of tolkien this series is not one that jumps into the collective consciousness back when i had an idea of reading a whole ton of books i found the titles and the author in one of
2239,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,like many other s i vastly enjoyed the first two books like many other s i did not care for the third book i couldn t even finish it i ve been trying to finish it for a year but i just don t have it in me to keep picking it back up the first two books are well written enchanting suspenseful tragic and strange it s a little bit of culture shock in a book in sections there are parts that you have no idea why they are included ex in the first five pages of the first book but withou
2240,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,why people don’t add this to the humour shelf is beyond me it’s funnier than a lot of books irma prunesquallor finding love the doctor and his bonkers rants the professors all going on the same date the headmaster’s upside down death i laughed out loud many times also the advice some people give to read each part using a separate physical book – because it’s too heavy to hold as a ‘trilogy’ – is poppycock get the doorstop bumper edition and let the incredible thing make your arms ache 
2241,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,3,this trilogy is hard to review as one book so i have split it here book num peake uses the brooding grim world of gormenghast to introduce the caricatures of his ensemble cast brilliantly formed individuals who are believable more for their exaggerated behaviours than in spite of the book is at its strongest when peake uses his broad vocabulary to bring to life the brilliant natural features of the landscape unfairly labelled fantasy gormenghast is instead analogy and setting written as a
2242,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,i thoroughly enjoyed the chaos lunacy beautiful english the slow build up of each character the multiple holy fucks throughout the series but the only thing i have to be honest and hold up my hands and say oh well there s one little thing i have to come out and confess about this whole thing and that is as much as i ve tried and oh god have i tried it was like when i tried to watch the exorcist num or the omen num or superman num and num it was a chore but i eventually got around to doing it but m
2243,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,this ginormous volume of a book took the better part of three years to read and i have to say i absolutely loved it mervyn peake quickly became one of my favourites right up there with j r r tolkien haruki murakami and margaret atwood it took me forever to read given how large the book itself was as well as the fact that oftentimes everything seemed to move ever so slowly and yet here i am absolutely in love with it because of the story the characters the gothic world created and
2244,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,fascinating this book is a perfect example of why i love book challenges i would have never picked this book up to read if it wasn t for the category of a genre you ve never heard of had not been on my list it was recommended to me by a nice young man in the used book store there are actually num books in my copy but i ve only read the first book gormenghast so far but i will go back and finish the other num mervyn peake the author has a wonderful vivid bizarre imagination the book i
2245,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,3,unlike anything i ve ever read were peake trying to get this published presently i m not sure he d ever make it past the submissions heap it lacks the momentum the immediate hook all the current necesities and yet somehow through sheer descriptive power and individuality kept me curious i wanted to know what the point of the strangely horrible caricature characters was whether there was some actual plot or whether it was just a succession of strangeness and i ll point out here nothing hap
2246,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,what did you think of the gormenghast trilogy i think composing a eulogy for my twin brother would be simpler he is still alive although struggling for words this quote is near perfect [peake s books] are actual additions to life they give like certain rare dreams sensations we never had before and enlarge our conception of the range of possible experience c s lewis gormenghast is sublime the greatest books in the english language and the only books i have read which i could desc
2247,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,the first two novels are a gothic masterpiece and should stand alone as a complete story titus groan and gormenghast tell of a symbolic journey through the crumbling edifice of tradition and toward adulthood the third book titus alone is oddly apocryphal and disjointed some of that is surely due to peake s final illness at the time of writing but not all there s a sense of the unnecessary and aimless to the third book which is why the trilogy as a whole loses a star it would have been best
2248,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,3,couldn t bring myself to finish this forty pages in to volume num and i just wanted to skip so much of it that it became pointless the problem is the prose peake rambles forever on minor details that in more managed quantity would be rich texturing and happy diversion but it just reads as though he put down every last thought that occurred to him and nobody bothered to edit any of it out so despite there being a good book buried in there somewhere the effort of getting to it was more than
2249,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,it s weird to think of this book as both a classic and a cult classic it appeared the same time as the lotr but while that became big and would eventually create an entire franchise and genre mervyn peak s gormenghast remained in the shadows it some ways it suits it with its strange gothic crumbling castle of gormenghast filled with angry people and its weird landscapes of carvers and eventually flying cars it s a fantastic book and this edition includes peake s own illustrations of his dick
2250,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,i very rarely venture into the realms of fantasy fiction and this has sat on my bookshelf for three years whilst i summoned up the energy to tackle it but it was worth it peake s writing is stunning every sentence is beautifully created completely drawing the reader into the strange world of gormenghast and its odd cast of characters weird and wonderful this is a trilogy to read slowly and indulge in even if the final book does seem slightly off kilter with the other two 
2251,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,this is perhaps the most difficult book i ve ever read and i ve read derrida it took me the entire summer to finish but this series is a towering classic an absolutely essential work that bears no resemblance to anything else peake s characterization worldbuilding and prose style are beyond compare the plot is often nonexistent but when it s exciting it s very exciting reading it is worth the effort 
2252,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,i read this book after watching the bbc series my english is pretty good even if i m not a native speaker but still i had to look up at least one word every other page that doesn t mean the books were unreadable it s just that peakes vocabulary is amazing and the world of ghormenghast evocative weird bleak sinister it s like walking through a house of fun mirrors where everything is distorted i loved the novels and i would certainly reccomend them 
2253,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,i enjoyed this book in the way i enjoy a trip to the zoo look at all the amazing creatures it also has some well built plots if you are able to suspend your disbelief you ll probably enjoy it a lot still i wish that it were a little more closely connected to reality i don t mean more realistic but with more of a feeling of representing a deeper reality like the moomintroll books or the lightning jar a recent book in a similar vein that i think deserves a shout out 
2254,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,it took me ages to finish this this was given to me by my uncle who loved the series but i found it slow to start i finished the last book which was so different from the previous books that it gave me whiplash num num stars num num stars num num stars im just going to give it num stars hard to want to read but utterly unputdownable once you start 
2255,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,read a long time ago i thoroughly enjoyed this especially titus groan and gormenghast titus alone wasn t quite so impressive reluctantly i decided to get the dvd a most unusual decision for me as more often than not the visual media usually disappoints but this most definitely didn t although of course the book still remains the better option 
2256,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,castle gormenghast is a sprawling decaying gothic labyrinth its deliciously dickensian inhabitants are its strength scheming steerpike wild fucshia lord sepulchrave and titus the boy about to inherit it all 
2257,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,fantastic in every way but just as i cannot eat a large cheesecake every night i cannot read words this rich every night after three weeks and being well into the second book i must stop a case of literary clogged arteries it is just too much but i loved the parts i imbibed 
2258,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,2,somewhere in here is a good story but the writing style drowns the narrative at times the language is so obscure that the meaning is lost and that really makes this a chore to get through steerpike is one of the best villains ever created and his arc is such that he for me was the hero

2267,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,i stumbled into gormenghast for the first time by surprise about six months ago and have only recently found my way back out i found it frustrating infuriating full of false starts and weird tangents but intensely poetic detailed lyrical and hypnotic like tristram shandy by way of wiliam blake well maybe not quite that throw in also grotesque and fabulous human caricatures like the weirdest of dickens or lewis carroll every one of them there are dozens sporting fantastic names li

2269,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,one afternoon at a friend s house she sat me down to watch the bbc miniseries that netflix had sent her telling me i would love it sure enough i found myself pulled into the world of gormenghast and i decided that i had to read the books as well finding them for less than num as i m a poor college student proved a challenge and i ultimately ended up purchasing the entire trilogy in one incredibly fat book off amazon and i sat down to read the three novels that comprise the series mo
2270,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,these are deeply weird books that are difficult to describe or categorize in the introduction anthony burgess who calls it a modern classic comparable to other celebrated british works of the nums such as those by orwell or waugh says there is no really close relative to it in all our prose literature i actually bought the trilogy this is part of years ago because it was recommended on the seven league shelf of the cream of modern fantasy works but there s nothing supernatural in
2271,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,mervyn peake s gormenghast novels are often compared to j r r tolkien s lord of the rings both supposedly being excellent examples of mid twentieth century epic fantasy but this comparison does not do them justice they are comparable perhaps in length and scale of imagination required in creating their individual worlds and it is possible that readers can enjoy both but it is not due to their similarities gormenghast is better described as fantastic in the sense of being imaginative or
2272,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,the gormenghast novels should be read to one in childhood or delved into over a lifetime over tea in the form of an ancient and intimidating tome peake has created a bizarre and complicated painting to rival the masters in grotesqueness and caricature but at its heart the painting depicted is a fairy tale of maturity and individual growth as it is a painting there is very little action or movement in the story and what little there is is described in a languorous lurid manner steerpike

2274,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,wow i was recommended to read this after one of my uni tutors read some of my writing and said mervyn peake might be of some interest to me i was cautious at first having heard mixed reviews but wow am i glad i took the risk the books follow the tale of titus groan numth earl of gormenghast although admittedly he doesn t really get much of a part in the tale until midway through the second book set in a crumbling castle on a mountain top where the often weird and ridiculous characters
2275,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,i had attempted to read mervyn peake s gormenghast trilogy several years ago but i didn t get very far more recently i decided it might be time to give it another try it centers around an immense gothic castle on a cliff where ritual is paramount and everyone s lives are dominated by meaningless ceremony the rulers and staff are eccentrics with descriptive names that sound like parts of an allegory the groan family the fat and sadistic chef swelter the master of ritual sourdust the per
2276,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,3, spoliers having started this around num years ago and got half way through the first book before getting bored it had been hanging over my head as the one book i had to finish a couple of years ago i finished the first book and it took so much out of me i couldn t carry on to the second at the time what motivated me to return was reading a review that explained that at some point titus leaves the medieval castle setting and travels to a place where a modern city exists this sci fi element a
2277,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,these books are so different from other fantasy books i ve read the imagery is striking and often bizarre the plot moves slowly but is still compelling normally i don t have much of a memory for plot within six months of finishing most books i ll already be pretty fuzzy on the details which tends to make ongoing series difficult i got about two thirds of the way through the first book and for various reasons set it aside for over a year yet i was able to pick it up and go straight back
2278,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,wow what a boggling expansive tale the quintessence of romantic gothic grotesque what wordplay and have you seen the wiki pic of the author he looks so alive and modern better even i m num/num s thru it s a castle story of a vast dreary stone place with dozens of bleak yet over the top characters no real heroes exactly no magic no little people lots of grey and crumbling stone some heroism emerges at a point i won t say where i m not sure that it s the key to the tale but it
2279,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,the gormenghast trilogy is the brilliant invention of mervyn peake who created a unique imaginative bizarre and compelling world in the form of an enormous decaying castle called gormenghast it s titular head is the earl of gormenghast but the place is really ruled by the arcane and stringent rituals that define and dictate daily life for everyone from the earl to the lowliest kitchen boy the story begins with the birth of titus groan heir to the seventy sixth earl of gormenghast lord se
2280,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,all in all this was a lovely set of books with amazing turns of phrase that sometimes leaves one utterly captivated at the pure beauty and elegance of the prose set in a fantastical decaying society whose surrender to madness and nature is reflected in the minds and spirits of its peoples as well as within the very stonework of gormenghast itself this work is a reflection of well observed social mores attitudes and conventions that comment as strongly on society today as it did in the era of
2282,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,2,the gormenghast novels are a trap a beautiful trap that ensnares its characters and its readers unfortunately it s not a good ensnarement these stories focus on the elite members of the groan family who live in the mysterious castle of gormenghast which may very well be alive these characters who are without fail highly eccentric are stuck in a rigid life of ritual and tradition there are literally hundreds of ceremonies rituals and traditions that appear meaningless but strictly enf
2283,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,this is another book trilogy that i have long meant to read and finally i have read the first book titus groan this covers the events from the birth of titus to his becoming numth earl of gormenghast just after his first birthday the pacing of the book feels quite slow initially and does take some getting used to but the atmosphere is incredible and as the manipulative steerpike navigates his way upwards through the house of groan i founds myself utterly sucked into the story obvious
2284,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,2,i finally decided to stop torturing myself by trying to finish titus alone and it lifted such a weight off my shoulder it s difficult to rate a collection of three novels especially when you have to give up on the last of the three in disgust and boredom it says something when out of a large cast of people easily my favorite character and the most interesting character is the castle peake spends so much time making most of the people seem ridiculous that it was hard for me to really feel
2285,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,incredible more later except this concerning book three what i ve done some research since starting this review and understand better how the last of the trilogy came into existence that feeds my determination to view the series as being two books that end with titus riding off into the unknown i ll just proceed from there having said that i can take a deep breath and state for the record that these books are quite an experience these books are the ultimate example of the journey being
2286,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,it seems churlish to fault the gormenghast trilogy as flawless that it isn’t is only partially the author’s fault the first two books are extraordinary a triumph of atmosphere and sense of place peake captures the claustrophobia of gormenghast a place of inertia hidebound by tradition and archaic rules populated almost solely by grotesques every character every action is saturated in symbolism peake’s writing is often so dense in conveying what’s going on it approaches poetry – given how
2287,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,2,wow peake s trilogy sure tries to fit into many literary categories a pity the author can t handle any of them competently or consistently titus groan numst of the num novels has been widely admired as a groundbreaking fantasy that presents a completely original world without relying on any magical devices so far so good but the originality partly reflects the paucity of peake s characters and the their vacuousness peake over and over asserts the characters devotion to ritual but the examp

2290,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,i ve never read anything like this it is colossal and it moves at a glacial pace but you ve never seen such a strange glacier the outbreaks of treachery and violence even though they occur suddenly and chaotically feel like spiky upwellings of this inevitable massive narrative machine beneath the surface of things it is a book for people who like language peake is gifted at metaphor and the language of the series grows increasingly poetic over the span of an early lifetime from the

2293,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,this was a hell of a read the first two books titus groan and gormenghast are full of indelible images and some of the most grotesque characters i have ever come across in literature the simple evil ambitions of the youth steerpike seems commonplace among the vividly drawn characters of these novels the twins and the grandeur of their delusions their massive retardation the purple irma prunsquallor the most delusionally pathetic character swelter the cook gross and murderous flay fan
2294,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,age sixteen i came across a battered old copy of the gormenghast trilogy in the sixth form school library one bored lunchtime i couldn t get into it so i left it behind four years later and i actually enjoyed it first mervyn peake was an illustrator he drew beautifully grotesque or grotesquely beautiful pictures which are littered throughout his novels which matches the kind of prose going on he must have had an obsession with finding the divine amongst the dank because the story

2296,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,3,man i don t even know what to say i think if i hadn t seen the movie i would have been very lost the writing is beautiful but sometimes i just wished peake would get to the point i mentally compared it to num years of solitude because for me both were a struggle to read but had the most amazing images the way the queen s cats flow around her in a white cloud how it s described is so evocative i read it as a beautiful metaphor for something that s meant to be elegant but is really dirty
2297,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,returned to currently reading status because i just started the second book gormenghast i finished the first novel titus groan the style of this book is so different from anything i ve ever read that it s difficult to describe this book is written in a narrative style that is dense with visual description in a given chapter there will be maybe one small happening that advances the plot and all the rest will be atmospheric and visual description it s obvious that peake conceived of his
2298,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,okay so goodreads is counting this as num book but technically i m counting it as num titus groan the introduction to gormenghast this one i liked despite the lack of a plot through most of it because of its atmosphere and eccentric characters nothing really happens until the end but it s super gothic and spooky and makes the castle of gormenghast a tremendously enticing place to visit gormenghast this one is better i d probably give it five stars if i was rating this book alone it s wei
2299,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,this is an awkward book to review because it was actually three books in one so here are three separate reviews titus groan num stars i really don t know how to describe titus groan it is perhaps in a genre all to itself it isn t realistic but it isn t precisely fantasy either fantastic things happen but there is no magic it is an odd quirky book with much darkness it is written by an author that loves words but is an amazing wordsmith titus groan the character named in the title 
2300,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,for those who want something sui generis this is the one book you have to read peake was an illustrater and portrait artist from britain who served time in the army during world war ii his experiences during the war left such an indelible impression on his extremely sensitive nature that this masterpiece of odd semi gothic fantasy if you can call it that sprung from his fertile imagination gormenghast is a labyrinthine crumbling kingdom of strange castes and traditions where a kitchen

2302,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,2,i did not finish this book work of art thing i admired it greatly but could not finish it this novel if you can call it that is gothic mysterious unsettling and creaks of ancient ways and unspoken secrets i found the writing rich and heavy but it was horribly slow going rather like eating nothing but creme brulee for days on end a little bit is delicious but page after page becomes unsavory that said the novel created memorable characters with layered nuance and i a
2303,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,i did not finish the third book in the trilogy the change in setting and theme was too jarring for me to continue with titus alone this is definitely not a quick and easy read but it is extremely enjoyable all the same while slow the first two books are filled with eccentric characters as well as moments of tension between them scenes such as swelter s grotesque war against flay and steerpike s various manipulative relationships are unforgettable peake s language sparkles and flows through
2304,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,3,i ve reviewed the three component books separately these are my comments for the series as a whole basically this volume contains two very good finished books that are more or less a complete story between them it also contains an effectively unfinished third novel titus alone was edited together from peake s drafts while he was still alive but after his parkinson s had gotten bad enough that he could no longer contribute to the process i m less inclined to judge it as harshly as i di
2305,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,for sheer sustained imaginative power an unfailing attention to character detail dickens caricatures had none of this realism a brooding dark humour that goes deeper than any other work i can think of against a backdrop of unimaginably stifling rigidity and routine gormenghast has not been bettered by anyone in any genre full stop titus groan acts almost as an appetizer for the grandeur of the second in the trilogy the immensity of the crumbling castle it s labyrinthine corridors ro
2306,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,this is a num star series but you can t look at it from a perspective of any kind of genre too many reviewers try to classify these books as gothic science fiction or literature i must admit that when i first read these books back in the late nums and early nums as a college student i was not impressed i had to mature myself in order to develop a full appreciation for what peake did despite not liking the books back then the essence of gormanghast has always stuck in my mind recent
2307,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,quite frankly this book was amazing the ultra descriptive passages that it s peppered with and that make it a very long read are absolutely astounding at times there are many paragraphs that i reread just because they were so beautiful and the descriptions were so vivid and alive if i could write half so well as peake i would be very pleased indeed this book would certainly not be for everyone but it s certainly for me i would love to read the first two books of the trilogy again some
2308,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,this title is actually a trilogy completed by peake detailing the life of titus groan but perhaps more importantly the life of gormenghast and the rituals that lie behind its ancient walls the recurring theme found throughout the series is the knowing of ones self through the surroundings of ones childhood titus is in constant struggle to rebel from his past and create a new path a path set forth by his own making the conclusion of the series is quite revealing to peake s purpose and settle
2309,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,titus groan i think the ink was hallucinogenic if only you could see what i did excellent characters and great plot bakshi should have animated this did he ghormengast more real life feeling than previous equally hypnotic titus alone erm not so good this installment put s the groan in the series for sure i highly and sincerely recommend the first two titles for their craftsmanship peake was a painter and illustrator by trade and it seems here that he couldn t work his
2310,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,there is simply no competition this is without a doubt my favourite book of all time i save my num star ratings for those books which get under my skin and this one absolutely did peake doesn t just write a story he paints a picture with words and the result is truly beautiful one is transported to the castle of gormenghast the characters are well written each with their individual quirks and personalities however for me the biggest and best character of all is the castle itself with it
2311,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,in so many ways fantasy began with tolkien that does not mean however that there were not books of quality that came before written in a vivid almost over the top prose and inhabited by characters eccentric nearly to the point of absurdity the world of gormenghast that they dwell in is vast and ineffable i really liked the first two the slow build up to the dramatic conclusions my favorite parts were the duel between cook and servant and the peculiar courtship and relationship of the pr
2312,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,dense complicated fantasy although that may not be the best term for the gormenghast triology true peake was a contemporary of j r r tolkein and c s lewis but you won t find any elves or wizards hidden within the walls of gormenghast schemes within schemes ruthless anti heros a very convoluted family tree and a suitably byzantine conglomeration of architecture to go with it in keeping with tolkein and lewis style there s more verbage and wordiness than you d think necessary but th
2313,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,what to say about gormenghast to encourage people to read it these books have profoundly influenced many many other authors and if you read these books you’ll be nodding your head at intervals thinking “aha that’s where [fill in author’s name ] got that ” how to read gormenghast first of all don’t expect a rollicking adventure with mighty warriors powerful wizards and nasty dark lords with nasty minions nope this book is about atmosphere it moves slowly as stately and sprawling a
2314,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,2,peake s characters and sense of setting is strong particularly regarding the gothic feel of gormenghast and its ghostly inhabitants who are even more isolated in the contrasting arid surroundings of the house there is no stereotypically sublime landscapes or sense of nature as part of the house s dark corners and secrets instead is a feeling of increasing claustrophobia both within and without the crumbling groan dynasty as their family and world grow smaller and smaller unfortunately p
2315,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,these books were beautiful and mesmerizing i found myself picturing each setting when i was driving or drifting off to sleep in a way i haven t pictured in a long time his writing style combines poetry and prose in a simple but elegant and effective way the first novel is a simple story line but the settings make this novel seem to be epic in scale the second novel is what really captured me and turned me into a great lover of these books the third novel was very hard to read unfortunately
2317,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,ok i m going to clarify that i really liked the first two books of this trilogy and didn t bother with book three mervyn peake was a wonderful describer he could describe the same mountains from three angles and it would just make them that bit more num d if you could be bothered reading to the end of the description i admit i often skipped however the cast of characters is delightful i loved steerepike of course this may have been helped by my picturing jonathan rhys meyers from
2318,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,i read these books back in my teenage years and have reread them a couple of times since they are epic in every sense of the word the castle gormenghast and all it s inhabitants range from very grotesque and fascinating to silly the books are never boring for a moment fuchsia was a heroine of my socially awkward and intense unforgivingness i could hold a grudge like nobody s business [okay not as bad as morrissey but still] here was no intensely pretty girl but one who was both ugly and pret

2320,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,i found this trilogy because of the bbc adaptation it fascinated me so i borrowed the books from the library and devoured them the characters and the world are well described and are memorable for example the original description of steerpike his body gave the appearance of being malformed but it would be difficult to say exactly what gave it this gibbous quality limb by limb it appeared that he was sound enough but the sum of these several members accrued to an unexpectedly twisted tot
2321,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,if charles dickens decided to write fantasy novels he would probably write something like gormenghast although frankly i think peake is a better writer than dickens they both write outrageously long novels that detail dark sooty and unpleasant people and places they both introduce new characters that it s hard to invest in after num pages or so with the old ones the characters have odd names that vaguely insinuate their personality peake is also more lyrical in his writing sometimes swapp
2322,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,these books are very different from traditional fantasy indeed they differ greatly from anything else i have ever read they are so good i m actually surprised there haven t been more copycat novels the world of gormenghast is fully fleshed and the characters are interesting i love the gothic setting the only part of the trilogy that disappointed me slightly was the ending as it didn t provide as satisfactory or as resolved a conclusion as i would have liked the third book didn t feel as p
2323,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,an amazing trilogy of books the three books centre on gormenghast castle a place so ancient its beginnings are lost in history and with timeless traditions and rituals whose meaning is long since forgotten it is in an intricate and densely gothic tale peopled by grotesques and lunatic characters centring on the ambitious steerpike and his sinister ascent through the castle s social structures mervyn peake has fashioned as odd and weird a fiction as i ve come across but the whole thing is str
2324,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,this would have gotten five stars if it would have stopped after the wonderful first two books once titus leaves the only setting that apparently makes him an interesting sympathetic or relatable character and a doer of deeds he pretty much wanders around treating people poorly and getting into jams he can t solve without the help of others the writing was still fantastic but i quickly got tired of reading about a useless self centered jerk who s been let loose on the world at large i ha
2325,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,2,they say it is a classic i found it terrible to read i had to wrestle through the book sometimes it took more than four pages in the longer chapters to find out about whom the author was talking but i persevered and read this trilogy although it will be only once you can feel that the author was a poet and the used language is not the easiest to get the story that he tries to tell is a bizarre one and the leading figure is a sad figure a kind of an antihero all the other characters a
2326,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,went to england for the first time in num lived in a cambridge university owned old manor house with a bunch of other wierdo scholars someone recommended the gormenghast novels to get the feel of life in a complicated maze of buildings and histories like cambridge i read each of the three books going to and from usa for a visit and was totally lost in the story now i ve got goodreads and a way to write down thoughts but heck it s num a long time over forty years since i read the book
2327,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,i remember seeing well worn paperback editions of this series in the public library when i was younger i was hesitant to read it because although it seemed to be from the same tradition and era as tolkien everything i d heard about it said otherwise when i thought i was ready to approach it in high school i was steered away from it by a well meaning librarian i think now it was something of a disservice but i forgive her i loved the bbc television series that was aired on pbs here in the
2328,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,4,this is not a beach book stick with grisham if that is what your looking for instead this tome is a serious undertaking for those who love writing beyond compare and descriptions that would make most present day authors green with envy it is set in a timeless place gormanghast castle is not found on any map the overall atmosphere of the book is dark and full of imaginative characters the characters themselves are almost from dickens but much more what reader could resist such names as f
2329,The Gormenghast Novels,Mervyn Peake,5,wow there is no other word for this series peake’s lush writing transports the reader to the moldering castle of gormenghast stagnant in its ritual the characters’ lives unfold in little dramas that have sweeping consequences for the world in which they live the third book has a much different tone than the first two and moves along much quicker but is just as mesmerizing as the first two titus is not my favorite character in the series and so the third book in which he leaves behind the
2330,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,i can t believe i had never reread this series such a fascinating world such a good story 
2331,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,until recently this series had somehow flown under my radar it wasn’t until i saw the trailer for the upcoming the golden compass movie that i was introduced to lyra’s world the trailer made the movie look amazing so naturally as i always do i thought…”i must read this book ” his dark materials creates a beautiful vibrant world with characters as deep as if you had known them your whole life the books themselves deal with heavy subjects nuclear physics parallel worlds quantum partic
2332,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,day late and a dollar short with this one my hope was to have read and reviewed his dark materials trilogy before the film adaptation of the first third the golden compass came out last friday and i would have too if it weren t for that sheer enormity of suckiness that was the third book in the series the amber spyglass sigh but then life doesn t actually work out perfectly for us as often as we d like sometimes there are earthquakes that level cities in turkey sometimes spinach is
2333,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,in just under a month la belle sauvage the book of dust num will be released so i thought i’d do a summative review of my experience with this trilogy here’s what i thought of each book i read them over a period of four years and my reviews are what i thought at the time they’ve not been edited since book num the golden compass num this novel is an absolute work of pure genius and is in my top ten reads of all time before i go into the depths of character and plot let me start by saying
2334,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,could you imagine a story that weaves history quantum physics theology cosmology trepanning shamanism love and the seriousness of adolescence into a coherent narrative i could not yet phillip pullman has done just that and a world more this wonderful trilogy will lead you along a most unlikely path through some of the biggest questions of life in philosophy religion history science and not least literature that it does so as a masterful child accessible and wholly engaging stor
2335,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,the first sentence that came to my mind after finishing this book was anyone who would give this novel less than five stars has to be either a philistine a charlatan or a cynic to add to that a cynic grown so dull with the slop of the world that they have been rendered unable to see the raw charm of these characters lyra and will and the amazing sad kind of beauty that comes with making the irreversible passage from childhood to adulthood pullman is able to weave together in the thread of
2336,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,so this is a bind up of all three books in this series and it s a reread for me i first read these when i was very young maybe num/num and i remember absolutely loving them this still remains true to this day and they are excellent books the second time through too also being num years older now than when i first read it helped me to notice a lot more of the subtle references to religion souls sex body image and so on none of these were things i was even considering when i was young but
2337,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,i don t guess you could call this the gold standard of classic fantasy literature that probably goes to harry potter but his dark materials soars in that same stratosphere it is so brilliantly conceived so intricately constructed and so well written that it leaves one in awe of pulliam s achievement this trilogy is composed of three separately published volumes northern lights the golden compass in north america num the subtle knife num and the amber spyglass num a sequel 
2338,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,great fantasy amazing story i think of all three books i loved the first one northern lights the most because it introduced me to this amazing world and it felt the most wintry to me with its polar bears snow and magic that being said the two other books the subtle knife and the amber spyglass were really good as well and especially the second book kept my interest peaked this is one of those series that is written for children on the surface but that is highly relevant and rea
2339,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4, spoilers below i read the first two books when they came out my middle school years but got tired of waiting for the third however when this whole controversy over the golden compass film adaptation was started by the christian right i decided it was time to read the series again i simply didn t remember philip pullman s message about god and the church disturbing me as a regularly church going num year old sure it made me think about what a corrupt church could do but it all seemed hyp
2340,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,this review only applies to book num the golden compass growing up with an addiction to dungeons dragons and reading through my town library s entire science fiction and fantasy section before i was sixteen has left me with a life long proclivity for the fantastic some of my favorite novels manage to combine the highly literary or experimental with the fantastical i m willing to take a chance on books considered straight fantasy or science fiction but i haven t been making the best choi
2341,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,so i was interested in reading the golden compass series by phillip pullman the golden compass the subtle knife the amber spyglass because some parents have asked us to remove it from the shelf at the school library after hearing the allegations about the books that they are intended to persuade children to become atheists i was feeling like people had not given them a chance i had already begun to read the golden compass before i had heard about any of the controversy after all and
2342,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,northern lights / the golden compass numnovnum num stars breathtaking and smart and utterly brilliant reading several of pullman s interviews has made me decide to re/read the chronicles of narnia at some point in num the misconception that his dark materials is a direct rebuttal of narnia has interested me for years and then to finally read this and hear from pullman himself that it is not said rebuttal makes it that much more interesting i love the idea of the church being the ruthless/villai
2343,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,i am actually assuming that i will be left behind so my concern is more for others i hate seeing families and friends split apart when it does occur i would like to be someplace like a church where there will be lots of people raptured that way right afterwards i ll be able to pick up all the wallets and purses that are also left behind you don t need money in heaven right and with all the honest folk gone i also feel confident that post rapture will be ripe for money making opportu
2344,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,defenitely a winner normally this sort of fantasy books is not my cup of tea but i adored reading this book the themes it handles are very grown up i don t understand how a child could understand all what is in the book it never becomes trivial or laughable everyone thinks very logically the plans are well taught over and everyone handles according to this plans i don t know what to say more about the book just read it 
2345,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,one of those books you don t want to finish wow i could recommend this to literally anyone and if they have the gumption and persistence they would get a helluvalot out of it what do i have to say to convince you just read it think about it enjoy it 
2346,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,in three words epic heartbreaking imaginative but i stopped believing there was a power of good and a power of evil that were outside us and i came to believe that good and evil are names for what people do not for what they are all we can say is that this is a good deed because it helps someone or that s a evil one because it hurts them people are too complicated to have simple labels challenge myeverymanslibrary note this everyman s library edition contains all three books of t
2347,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,never has a book/series had such an impact on me as his dark materials specifically the amber spyglass it still stands as the only book that has ever made me cry i was a wreck after finishing it to the point where i literally could not sleep because i couldn’t believe it was over not only was the ending beautifully heartbreaking but i had to accept the fact that these characters journeys had come to an end the series was over and it was time for me to move on in my life i just couldn t
2348,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,add me to what i m sure is a very short list of people who didn t get the whole anti god sentiment that this series is supposedly laden with i read this series for the first time several years ago while working in a book store and madly searching for something to tide me over until the next harry potter came out i became a dedicated pullman fan within a few pages of the golden compass i like young adult fantasy that doesn t pander and pullman wouldn t dream of doing that to his readers he
2349,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,1,this is not a series i would have exposed my children to if you choose to and i m sure many will that is up to you there is a deal of indoctrination here or if you consider the narnia series indoctrination then maybe you won t use that term in this case it s all i suppose in the eye of the beholder so up to the parent or if we re talking adults then the reader view spoiler [i gave a spoiler warning in case you don t want to read farther this series is basically a set of books where wh
2350,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,this was a truly amazing story i m actually giving it a num num instead of a num it was getting a strong num until the ending it wasn t a horrible ending but it could have been better i cried if that tells you something /
2351,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,if harry potter series were considered heretic by some groups of people i don t know what will they say when they read philip pullman s his dark materials as the books do reflect anti christianism with god portrayed as vindictive and authoritarian figure growing dare i say it senile and need to be ousted oh my god his dark materials is a trilogy beginning with the shocking the golden compass and followed by the subtle knife and ends with the amber spyglass and if we disregard the ant
2352,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,1,remember how when the film version of the golden compass came out evangelicals told their followers not to see it because the book is about a battle against god and that god is defeated in the end they were right and it s really sort of childish in the bad way and i m about as far to the left of the right wing religious nut cases as you can get i m all for a critique of how religion has hobbled civilization i firmly believe that the church pick your religion not just the christian ch
2353,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,i ve just finished the golden compass i can t believe i waited so long to read this book it was simple yet lovely with interesting characters setting plot it was so engrossing that i managed to read the last third of it at the courthouse between jury duty sessions i m sure that a large part of my sheer pleasure at reading this comes from the setting itself having long been fascinated by the far north but i think there s quite enough there for those less enamored of snow ice and polar
2354,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,1,very rarely do i start a book and not finish it i ve read some really awful books in my time and have managed to finish most however i gave up on this book on page num i think num pages is more than enough to get an idea of whether or not a book is worth finishing this one isn t worth finishing i really don t care about the controversy surrounding the author his philosophy and how it s presented in the book all i care about is that it s ponderous preachy and annoying i ve read too many
2356,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,i started reading this trilogy almost two years ago with my girlfriend and despite taking some very long stretches off we finally finished it today her review in brief the end drags a bit these books were very important to me as a child second only to maybe harry potter in terms of shaping my worldview to be honest i didn t understand the books or the impact they had on me until we started re reading them last year it s a re read that got much richer with time delighting and surpris
2357,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,3,i like my wild adventurous fantasy tales as much as the next fella but i have some issues with this series first it clearly wants to be the anti narnia and that s fine but i wish it wasn t so blatant about it many of the characters exist solely as two dimensional metaphors and many of the plot developments and magical or fantastical elements of the world seem to exist solely to make the point that no we re not in narnia anymore the lion is not jesus and actually the church is trying to
2359,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,1,firstly i must say that i read this books back in num so i may don t remember some things i will start saying that i don t understand what is the whole fuss about this saga i don t like it at all in fact i have come to a point where i hate these books with the exception of the first they are bad and i can demonstrate that without mentioning pullman s beliefs although it somewhat includes them since i hate the way pullman presented religious people or other things but i will deal with i
2360,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5, marking this edition in place of the amber spyglass so i can have my own edition in read as well this series i can t wrap my head around it yet there is so much to look at figure out and marvel over in this series it s hard to come up with a review of any kind i think i don t fully understand it yet at this point missing very valuable information on thing pullman references to and uses in the series what i can say is that this is one of the most stunning complex and magical series tha
2361,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,1,first let me make one thing clear before i review this book i work in a library i am totally against the banning of books censorship as a colleagues button says does not protect innocence it only promotes ignorance but i also do think that we should be careful with the books out there there are some books that are not meant for kids of certain ages simply because they are not yet ready to handle the content this is true about the golden compass series it may have animals on the cover
2362,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,holy shit 
2363,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,i didn t know about philip pullman and his dark materials before the trailers for the golden compass aired and i m a bit sad about that i would have loved to have read this when i was a teenager anyways on to the review the golden compas the storyline in the golden compas is so well crafted compelling and interdependent that it s hard to tell much of it without revealing too much but i ll try lyra the main protagonist is a little girl living at jordan college oxford she s a tomboy w
2364,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,1,i suppose i should rate these one at a time because i don t think they were all horrible books but the last book was so terrible that it really drags down the whole series for me the first book was pretty good once i got used to the fact that it took place in a parallel steam punk world where things were almost the same but spelled differently i was able to enjoy the creative and fast paced adventure the second book i read in a single sitting on a plane this one got a little confusing th
2365,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,3,norther lights num stars the subtle knife num stars the amber spyglass num stars eh this was dare i say kind of disappointing pullman s trilogy is famous for being a tad dark for a middle grade/ya trilogy and a tad naughty for ruffling some religious feathers these are the things i enjoyed about the trilogy i found the darkness of the story quite refreshing and the whole remove a false god plot concept interesting that said i m not in love with the execution of the concept i thought north
2366,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,this trilogy started out with so much promise what went wrong i ll tell you what went wrong well no i won t but the first book was really fun to read i m still in the third it s one of those that i dread reading but i feel a stupid obligation to finish a book once i ve started golden compass is great fun characters intriguing plot some mystery and suspense the subtle knife is about half as good it introduces a somewhat enjoyable new character with a really cool knife which is neat
2367,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,northern lights i really reeeally enjoyed the first book of the his dark materials trilogy the world building writing style and characters are awesome the end was so thrilling and intense num num/num the subtle knife the second book was almost as good as the first one i really liked how the story and the characters have developed num/num the amber spyglass the beginning was awesome but sadly all those strange religious and divine elements annoyed me towards the end num/num
2368,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,finding this book cheap at walmart should have been a dead give away that i would end up not liking this series thank god i finished this series though see what i did there i actually liked the first book the second book was okay but the last book i wanted it to end right after the first few chapters the tone and structure of these books bothered me the most all the books don t really flow well together if you read them as one book the first book is kind of the stranded novel the secon
2370,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,this is actually a trilogy make up of the golden compass the subtle knife and the amber spyglass rigidly religious people should probably avoid these books because i m not exaggerating when i say it s blasphemous and if you are only looking for standard pulp fantasy this probably isn t for you either because it contains logical faults and occasionally contains some strange narrative lapses however as a work of fiction that seeks to enlighten and not just entertain this is a wildly succes
2371,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,northern lights the golden compass quite fantastical initial thoughts num excellent descriptive writing num lyra is a character that has room for development she s curious and courageous but she s not impervious to the dangers around her great character growth throughout num the plot is slow and steady but all the fantastical elements make for an interesting and adventurous read num great setup to the next book the ending is fast paced and a few twists are thrown in num amazing fantasy elemen

2374,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,this book is the compilation of all three novels from the pullman series there are spoilers in this review you ve been warned the golden compass was an interesting read pullman succeeds in creating a very imaginative world where the main character lyra belacqua discovers bizarre and spell bounding places but where pullman fails is in the building of characters and their relationships to one another i found the characters disconnected and their interactions with one another flat in many i
2375,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,i got this edition containing all num books in the trilogy because of the author s lantern notes at the end of each of the three books as of the first book didn t find the notes worth reading the second they were slightly more interesting but not essential i did appreciate those that came after the third book i do not understand how i missed knowing about these books until late in num but i’m really glad that i found them the golden compass num stars i don’t consider fantasy to be “my” genre
2376,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,many have called me insolent and heretic but i m not afraid no i m proud to declare that yes i prefer his dark materials to the lord of the rings his dark materials is probably my favourite fantasy book series harry potter might be addictive and memorable lord of the rings might be epic but hdm is meaningful it is beautiful in a way neither of the other two big fantasy series are each successive book escalates matures in scope themes depth and emotional power lyra s parallel unive
2377,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,1,okay the fact that there was conterversy about this book was the main reason i read it after all i thought remember the all the fuss over harry potter why let other people make up my mind for me well i am glad i read it if only to tell others not to waste their time the series starts off well enough with the golden compass it intruduces some fun ideas and new takes in the sometimes stale fantasy genre it was interesting and free from any obnoxious anti god sentiment the next book the s
2378,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,3,the golden compass num stars the subtle knife num stars the amber spyglass num star the trilogy started with a lot of promise i enjoyed all the characters and ideas presented in the first book the second book was a little strange but many of the new characters were interesting and i dug the inter world travel the third book was dreadful so many new characters thrown at you so many new subplots going on and a huge disappointment of an ending despite my generous num stars for the trilogy as
2379,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,3,i would possibly have given the golden compass num stars the other two would be somewhere around num i really enjoyed the story so many of the characters are wonderful and the world s that pullman created are very original and creative i loved how dust worked in so differently to each one the ending well i understand it but that doesn t mean i have to like it 
2381,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,i can t believe it but rereading the series second time in two months or so made me love this series more than i have ever loved any series his dark materials is incredible and i recommend every one to pick up the books i have no words really to put my feelings in words i think i will go bed now after finishing the last book and cry myself to sleep not being dramatic at all 
2382,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,i read this trilogy just to see what all the hub bub was about i never knew these books existed until that horrible movie came out which i admittedly didn t really watch except in parts and pieces you don t have to finish a plateful of poop to know you re eating poop then i learned this was an acclaimed story for young readers i also heard it would turn your kid into a god hating atheist well that s something i ve got to see my curiosity was piqued the first book surprised me i
2383,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,when i first read the golden compass the other books had not yet been published i was excited about the trilogy but then real life intruded and i didn t read the other books until now the golden compass is the best of the bunch and if not for the ending which demands a sequel and a discussion of castrati more on that later i d recommend it as a stand alone young adult novel it s well plotted exciting and well written but it s also very clearly part of a trilogy and unfortunately th
2384,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,1,the golden compass gets five stars for an original setting vibrant and interesting characters and deffinitely a unique problem to solve it was an engaging quick read and i fell for lyra and the idea of souls/daemons immediately then i hit a brick wall called the subtle knife without anything to ease you into it lyra leaves the world you know all together it could not have been more harsh and for every chapter i forced myself to read i stopped and read an entirely different novel before agai
2385,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,1,i wish there was a way to make the stars blink between one and five because that s pretty much how the books go if you look at them from a simple this book is just a book as most are the concept is interesting complex and a lovely tale about strange happenings if you look at it how pullman would like you to it kind of makes the whole thing wither and die in a cruel sort of way which as most of us readers can gather sucks yeah sucks pretty much describes it it s as though once you r
2386,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,quite seriously one of the best most well written awe inspiring series i have read it seamlessly weaves together such diverse concepts as quantum theory religion relativity and spirituality as the framework for a story that is really all about childhood and friendship as well as the gut wrenching decisions we all have to make in this life be with your true love or save the universe as to the controversy surrounding it yes the backdrop of this story is about a bunch of people who are s
2387,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,3,oy finally after close to three months work finished the whole thing and i m pretty sure phillip pullman is kind of a whackjob mind you i m coming at this as someone who agrees with a lot of what he seems to have to say atheism antitheism the whole schmear but it seems he s too hung up on defeating the influence of religion and lets it get in the way of his point i won t even go into the sort of quasi pedophiliac vibe the last third of the amber spyglass had as a person who s not a f
2388,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,i have to admit that i really liked these books even with the controversy surrounding them well rounded people must do as i try to and remember that these are only books if you don t think the movie coming out is a great thing don t watch it i probably won t be able to watch the movie when it comes out so be it but the books were pretty cool save for the ghosts and stuff like that and i don t get the killing god thing where in these books did they kill god edit num/num/num watched th
2389,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,1,it gives me pleasure to give these books one star as if in some way i am getting back at them for being so awful even now nine years after reading them i cringe when i think of the bleak depressing horrible view this story has of the afterlife i came away from this trilogy wishing i had never read it wishing i could expel these descriptions and images from my mind ugh it s sad to think that children could read these books and even for a moment wonder whether the author s misguided th
2390,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,1,hugely overrated the first book is tolerable but the series degenerates as pullman unveils his bizarre agenda truly awful with whole chapters like the one with the wheel people or mulefa which should have been red penciled by the publisher how this ever became a bestseller is beyond me 
2391,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,they should ve kept making the movies they would ve been spectacular but then these books aren t for everyone someone who doesn t have an open mind wouldn t be able to handle them they were fascinating and intrigueing and i loved them 
2393,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,i ve only read the first volume and it dragged in an age when any fantasy novel has to compete with harry potter narnia and lord of the rings pullman gives a pale comparison alas good idea weak execution 
2395,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,this is how you write a book i consider the three as one giant thousand page novel the unique prose of pullman s writing style is put to excellent use and to think that this is a young adult novel is frankly astounding given the subject material this is up there with harry potter excellence and to be honest pullman is a better writer than rowling so dare i say it s even better not that the two should be compared because they exist on extremely separate planes this story revolves around a
2396,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,at last i no longer need to stuff this num page monster into my bag in the mornings is this why people have kindles it was interesting going into such a famous trilogy without knowing much about it beyond the first book which i read perhaps num years ago but after svalbard i knew nothing so the religiosity angels the catholic church plot points were all unexpected and although i was disappointed that the story was heading for an eve allegory it did pull it off okay in the end i sti
2397,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,a friend of mine once said that a characterization of science fiction writers is that they have amazing some of the most innovative ideas and at best mediocre writing skills it would be too much to say that s the case with this story but there is of course a reason my friend s remark popped up in my head first the obvious this trilogy is not a science fiction story but a unique parallel world fantasy however the bulk of the central ideas are quite scientific we re talking the man
2398,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,review for the golden compass cover gushing worthiness i really like the cover of the omnibus edition i can’t say if it fully captures the spirit of the subtle knife and the amber spyglass but it does capture the beauty of the golden compass perfectly the colour combinations are beautiful as well as the of the daemons review i first heard about the golden compass when i was in grade num some of my friends who were in the gifted program at my school read the book in grade num and loved it th
2399,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,num/num/num finished northern lights why rename it for god s sake the golden compass would ve fit the pattern of the book s names much better but who am i to argue with the author if i have to sit through that opening scene with the tokay one more time i will fall asleep in fact i forgot about most of this book except for the tokay scene because of how laborious it is the first time i read this book i gave up because of the tokay scene it was thanks to the audiobook version that i
2401,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,i greeted this trilogy like an old friend but had forgotten so many details especially from the last two books this book opened up my imagination for the first time when i was a kid and now at a second read through it obviously had more depth than i ever realized wholesome creative expansive heart wrenching 
2402,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,this will never not be my favorite series for children but what surprises me is how much more i get out of the amber spyglass as an adult than i did as a pre teen i am also extremely excited to learn more about lyra in the next few years who was always my least favorite part of this world but as someone with a kiddo very much like a lyra so far yeah i get it now and she s going to grow up into someone amazing 
2403,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,it sounds a little clichéd but i didn t realise how much this book shaped my life until i reread it as an adult my first reading of his dark materials wasn t even complete i got to around chapter num in the amber spyglass and got bored or distracted don t judge me too harshly i was num or num and there were so many other things to read despite dropping the final book a few concepts stuck with me at least consciously for many years afterwards the idea of a constant companion that could soothe
2405,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,i won t lie i started reading the his dark materials trilogy with doubts major doubts i haven t read fantasy in quite some time since getting into adult novels i used to love fantasy but after a while this entire prophecy thing and the chosen one and blablabla started to annoy me i wanted enthralling stories i wanted tension and philosophical notes i wanted the great writing kundera foer brönte murakami they were served to me and i devoured them all with great taste leaving fantasy
2406,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,pullman was clearly deeply influenced by paradise lost as both the title his dark materials and the themes for the books are taken from milton s works i have heard that these books are a source of controversy for christian groups and i suppose i can see why considering the status of death and the afterlife and the existence and relevance of deamons in pullman s books however while the characters struggle against an oppressive church it is not the creator against which they battle d
2407,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,i am usually happy to read about subjects that i don t necessarily agree with i m objective enough normally to accept things as works of fiction and not get offended by them in fact i think it is essentially important that people read a wide range of material and not just stick to safe topics that they agree with and relate to how else would people grow be educated or think through their arguments and opinions after all however i am going to make one exception in phillip pullman s case
2409,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,one big book with num very unique parts all of them equally unforgettable but the second and the third parts put this story in another whole level the golden compass num stars amazing book a fantasy book for children and adults intelectualy challenging very creative with a heroine that captivates the reader with her qualities and flaws the subtle knife num billion stars one of the best books i ve read in my life with many unforgettable things will is one of them the boy is incredible eve
2410,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,i think i can say without exaggeration that this book has changed my life i doubt i will ever know or understand all the literary metaphors and references but i think pullman himself would say that this doesn t matter it s a darned good story it s incredibly rich complex and epic it explores deeper questions about life s meaning without ever feeling heavy handed or preachy it s simpatico with opinions and feelings that i already have and have had for a long time but still challenged
2411,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,okay i have no reason for why i stopped this book i was so close to the end i don t remember why i actually stopped reading this the book was so good and i loved the movie i wish they had continued the movie i am/was actually considering re reading this book to see how far i get and to actually finish the book in the movie i liked the idea that each person had a animal given to them well more like when children grow up to be an adult their spirit animal that sticks with them change
2412,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,i started reading these books after being told that harry potter was intellectually thin compared to pullman s trilogy my as of now informed opinion i don t think that s true as far as philosophy goes pullman is beating a dead horse and making a show of it too but this is not the interesting question really it wasn t mind blowing philosophy that made me fall for harry potter but some great characters and a sufficiently intriguing though often contrived plot his dark materials didn t
2413,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,the books started out promising enough but i soon lost interest and had to force myself to keep reading by the third book lyra had changed so much and the plot was so convoluted that i really didn t care about the story at all i also found the books to be quite dark and full of adult themes considering i found them in the children s section at the library i would move them to the teen area myself / spoilers below / maybe i was so bored i didn t pay enough attention but in the first book
2414,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,i read these books because i was told not to and that always works i love nothing more than banned book week http //www bannedbooksweek org/ and reading the newest most hated books there are sometimes they are just really bad the author was trying so hard to goad the audience with sex and violence that it’s not art it’s just stupid despite the fighting warrior polar bears that is not the case here these are the most brilliant young adult novels i’ve never read never once does it speak
2415,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,one day i d like to write something worth justice of this trilogy oh my god ha what a read what read what an experience i swear to god ha seriously words at the moment cannot describe the feelings that came from reading these books i haven t shed more tears ever in my life while reading any other novel than i did with the last one in this otherworldly trilogy to know what real love is pure unembellished umblemished whole resilient love with a unwavering and unshakable resolve
2416,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,1,it was january of num when i was reading these books and it s not nearly july of num so it s reaching a ways back to remember all the reasons i didn t like the books and indeed never finished the third book of the trilogy but it goes a little something like this num i didn t like the writing random pov switches in scene a lot of telling vs showing shoddy/inconsistent characterization and poor structure num i didn t like the story from the overall portrayal/treatment of women to the cla
2417,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,what a journey i ve had this trilogy on my shelf unread for quite a few years but was prompted to start it after reading pullman s account of a brief spontaneous transcendental experience as he walked along london s charing cross road many years ago it gave him he said an insight into the interconnectedness and duality of everything including humans and said it had informed everything he has written ever since so i picked his dark materials off my self and then couldn t put it down th
2418,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,basically the universe is layer upon layer of parallel universes lyra can read the golden compass which is a highly effective means of answering life s most difficult questions she goes on adventures will has found the subtle knife which slices apart the universes and allows you travel between them they go on adventures together dr mary something has the amber spyglass which allows you to see dust which is dark matter which is everywhere attracts evil spectors and flows between the
2419,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,i just wasn t the same again once i had read this trilogy it changed my world view and opened me up to extraordinary possibilities especially as all of the fantastical elements are based on plausible science i stumbled over the first couple of chapters unsure of the voice of the novel but then i was hooked and stormed through all three books emotionally it took me through the whole gamut and left me with a haunting sense of simultaneous hope and melancholy not many books can tackle the
2420,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,this book has everything i love multiple universes magic daemons quantum mechanics and particle physics philosophy nonhuman creatures love you name it it s hard to explain just how wonderful this book is just like i assume it s hard to imagine how it could contain all these elements at all but it does and it binds them together masterfully and it is so so beautiful 
2421,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,this is the most moving trilogy of novels i have read magical beautiful and life affirming his dark materials should be prescribed on the nhs 
2422,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,the chronicles of narnia for athiests while at times pullman can list woefully towards melodromatic prose as a whole these books are some of the most fantastic fantasy books for young adults ever 
2423,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,there s nothing else i can say about these books except that simply they are the best things i ve ever read 
2424,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,i really enjoyed these books the author some huge stabs at religon/god not for young readers 
2425,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,review to come soon 
2426,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,3,the first book is great the second one ok and the third one dont bother 
2427,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,review originally published here http //girlwithherheadinabook co uk/num his dark materials was originally published as three separate books of which i first read the northern lights as an eleven year old then stumbled over the subtle knife the following year it was not until i was fourteen that i read the amber spyglass although pullman apparently always envisaged the trilogy as one unit almost from the very first page of the very first book the story instantly became one of my very favou
2428,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,original review posted here i had these books as a child and adored them though i’ll admit it took a while to get into them i distinctly remember reading the first page of northern lights and putting the book down deciding it was boring luckily i got past that and it was one of my favourite series for a long time my copies of the books are pretty battered and last year nathan bought me a beautiful edition of all three stories and i thought the rereadathon was the perfect time to read it nort
2430,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,the golden compass originally posted at https //iliveforreading blogspot com/ it s been forever since i d read the golden compass and reading it for the second time just made me love it even more when i was invited to join the blog tour i jumped at the opportunity because this was the perfect excuse to dive into a childhood favourite i ve never actually read the whole his dark materials series–i ve only read the golden compass and the subtle knife–and hopefully this gives me a chance to fin
2432,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,3,ok the bff is late so i have some time to get this done this book was overall not bad it was just not what i wanted it to be i’ve watched the movie like hundreds times and i loved the world i loved the daemons and i still find the idea very fascinating but at the end i didn’t feel satisfied with anything let’s take a look at the books separately so the golden compass i find this book to be the most interesting of the three it’s when you get to know the world and the characters and all was g
2433,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,hmmm loved it mostly it was well written and enjoyable to read mr pullman clearly understand religious philosophies and the doctrine of the catholic church to have so neatly woven it into different shapes from different versions of the stories realities the biblical references explaining daemons in lyra’s world is cleverly inventive add to that the whole viewpoint of any religious zealots and it’s quite frightening and easy to see how the human race can get itself into the mess we are
2434,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,my first read of num was a reread his dark materials is an incredible piece of work the structure characterisation and sheer depth of the thing always staggers me i ve read the trilogy three or four times in total since release and each time i come away with nothing but respect and admiration for pullman at its heart is a love story and i can claim romance research with each reread but really it s just tremendous fun and a great story the heroine learns and grows and is a strong female l
2435,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,3,i just read the his dark materials a k a the golden compass trilogy there will be spoilers here if you are an easily offended christian heck if you are a somewhat difficult to offend christian you probably don t want to read these i didn t see the movie and i knew nearly nothing about the series going into it beyond the idea of daemons from the cool meme on the movie site and armored polar bears even before reading the acknowledgments at the back of the trilogy i could tell that his
2436,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,when i was a teenager i used to reread my favorite books all over again not now because of fear to miss the really good new ones but after finishing the book of dust i couldn’t help it and started rereading his dark materials when i had been reading this trilogy num years ago i couldn’t get it was pullman’s writing skilled or it was just fascinating story to follow i guess it’s all about translation thing because now i can say for sure he is a brilliant writer indeed i spent num hours
2437,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,aah the child in me absolutely loved these books i really wish i d found them when i was younger they would definitely top potter world for me but reading them as an adult was still extremely enjoyable and meaningful they re definitely not kiddie books but rather ya sci fi the kind of books that provide deep emotional and spiritual sustenance 
2438,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,3,plot summary young lyra finds herself in the midst of a controversy that sparks a war between all existent universes a war in which the common understanding of sin is challenged and in which the rebels pit themselves against god himself to end death and bring about a new sense of balance to existence initial thoughts the story is really entertaining it really is but it’s pretty much impossible to immerse yourself fully in the story because throughout the series pullman seems to have quite an
2439,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,a master work in modern fantasy the amber spyglass is perhaps less good than the others but this is massively made up for by the sheer need to see the story through that was laid out in the northern lights and the subtle knife 
2440,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,first book done decided to mark as read as it gave me the heebie jeebies to have as currently reading will probably continue later on 
2441,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,fabulous books 
2442,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,it s num am i m absolutely heartbroken what more can i say 
2443,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,and and and i am done here is my blog on the book https //newfracturedlight wordpress c 
2444,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,unforgivable that i d left it this long to read this trilogy full review to come 
2445,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,o man if only this book were five times as long i can t believe i finished it already i loved it so much 
2446,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,this is my second time reading the trilogy and i enjoyed it as much as first time around over num years ago love the charcters development and the different worlds set up 
2447,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,what a story what a book intense addicting beautiful the beginning got me hooked immediately and the ending made a great impression on me 
2449,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,3,the first num books in this trilogy are brilliant num/num stars however the final book in the trilogy let it down as it dragged a lot 
2450,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,why have i only just discovered this magical fantasy world of wonder on par with the marvellous world of hp and lotrs where have you been hiding or rather where have i been hiding under a rock obviously
2451,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,the idea behind the novels is that there is not just one world but multiple uncountable multiples of worlds in num year old lyra s world the setting for the golden compass many things are very similar but the major difference is that the spirits of all people are separate from their bodies in animal form they are called daemons and are constant close ever loving ever loyal companions this is a very intrinsic part of the story and also one of the more interesting fantasy tropes of rec
2454,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,the golden compass num stars it s been a long time since i read a fantasy work that felt so original to me in terms of world building that s not to say that every aspect considered separately is new the technology level described here is basically steampunk even if it s missing the usual trappings but the combination of everything produced an ambience an aesthetic that felt fresh and interesting i also loved the deconstructionist theme question everything don t trust adults simply because
2455,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,paradise won his dark materials is a significant literary achievement it is some way from perfection but when it succeeds it does so massively when it fails it is more often than not the result of forgiveable over ambitiousness it has rightly come to be seen as a young person s classic and a work which can stand alongside the two other great oxford fantasies set in middle earth and narnia the first book the northern lights tells the story of lyra who has been brought up in an oxford colleg
2456,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,up front his dark materials is a saga that asks a lot of you and it s one that needs to be read one right after the other it s a series that deserves to be infused with your own emotions as well as your undivided attention despite the fact that there are many fantastical elements to this saga the many themes presented therein are ones that can easily be translated into our own worlds ready for us to decipher and unlock as we discover them even though these books were written for the young
2457,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,3,i gave this trilogy num stars because whilst the first two books are excellent the numrd book is terrible it is a morass of plot holes so large ocean liners could get lost in it it seemed that pullman completely ignored writing a decent story just so he could get to his message num in ci gazze we are told that spectres attack any adult it happens to the witches hunting lyra yet when mrs coulter turns up they leave her alone and not just alone they follow her orders we are not told why this hap
2458,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,that s right punks i bought the original british unchanged by stupid american publishers for no apparent reason trilogy and it continues to be an uphill battle since the lovely american postal system lost my first copy and amazon uk was gracious enough to send me another one free of charge i expect a very american rabid dog who has broken free of its rabidly patriotic owner to come grab the book out of my hand as soon as i try to read it such is this country s resistance to me reading th
2459,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,1,the only thing i knew about his dark materials when i began reading the series was that there was a movie coming out soon and i wanted to read the books first let me tell you that was not enough information please read a bit of background on these books before reading them or before your dependents read them so that you can answer their questions i was unprepared going into these books for some of the directions pullman chose to take the story and was therefore often left feeling uncomfo
2460,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,where to start this was an undertaking for sure i had tried to start the golden compass on probably num different occasions and just could not get further than a few chapters in this time i was determined to finish the whole trilogy so i could read pullman s upcoming book the book of dust and damn what a ride now i had a lot of background going into this because of the history behind it as an almost response to lewis chronicles of narnia pullman an outspoken atheist thought that lewi
2461,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,3,my god was i let down by these books when i read northern lights i was enchanted the concept of demons a great setting and a world unlike any fantasy world i d ever visited not to mention spunky lyra and her cool allies like the gypsians and iorek and the witches and what villains both asriel and coulter are detestable and yet understandable and finely drawn so i was in a world unlike any post lord of the rings fantasy full of promise and a great heroine but the series went from
2462,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,wow this book was so much worse than i thought it would be and i really tried to like it what struck me most was how utterly boring and unrelatable the protagonist „lyra“ was and how quick she was to declare her friendship and love at one point of the story the author stresses so much on how lyra „loved and trusted“ the big polar bear that i was seriously starting to wonder if she had a crush on the bear it all seemed very unnatural and forced since the bear was not a very compelling c
2463,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,i had been under the impression that this book was targeting young adults maybe i was misled by the movie which definitely marketed to kids but the content of this book was sufficiently adult and some pretty terrible things happened to kids things that i think i would have found really disturbing as a kid or even young adult and which i found relatively disturbing now however the fact that i thought this was a young adult book made me compare it to books i read as a pre teen on the w
2464,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,3,pfft what was that so disappointing the books started on a rising note and kept rising and rising into a crescendo and then when it was at its peak it seemed to have suddenly lost its wings swooping in hither and dither before falling with a big thud it feels like the writer just grew wary of the story or just fell out of love with it the loose threads weren t just left untended they were frayed into multiple other threads before a tiny one of them was picked up and it was decided
2465,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,i read this series or novel in num parts for the first time when i was num six years later it is just as atom splittingly astounding i don t know how anyone under the age of num can read this series and not become incapacitated with wonder i m just barely holding on the warning cs lewis rebuffs in his essay on fairy stories that children who read fantasy stories may come to resent the real world for not being magical could possibly be true in the case of reading his dark materials if you
2467,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,there s not a whole lot of new stuff i can really say about this book it s still one of my absolute all time favorites and in fact i probably love it even more now after my most recent reread the stuff with the world of the dead is beautiful and such a good message to send that people need to focus on having experiences in the here and now rather than worrying about after it s a lovely fantasized version of the atheist view of life and death the concept of dust is also wonderful and the
2469,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,i cannot say enough good things about this trilogy i decided to read the golden compass because i thought it was a kids’ book and i needed something light i still haven’t quite figured out if this series was written for adults or kids or both but it doesn’t matter because i think anyone would love the main characters a num year old girl and boy and the story is enthralling no matter how old you are it is more captivating and imaginative than the chronicles of narnia yet unlike the lord
2470,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,i was curious about this book since it was warned against by a lot of christians and the last book they warned against harry potter actually turned out not only to not lead children directly to the devil but also to be a pretty good story his dark materials which is really one story though originally released as a trilogy starting with the golden compass it is written as a children s book but i would not recommend it for children until they are mature enough to grapple with heavy topics
2471,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,if i hadn t already read these when the flurry of panicked emails went around when the golden compass hit the big screen i would have rushed out and done it just out of spite as it was i already knew the books were fabulous i have a vague memory of reading them on a picnic table up on cedar mountain in the summer i read them again this summer and the pleasure was only slightly lessened by the fact that i already knew what was going to happen when i compare the talent of pullman to most othe
2472,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,this year marked my fourth reread of the his dark materials trilogy in readiness for la belle sauvage which i excitedly queued up for in waterstones last autumn i d not been in a queue for a specific book since harry potter and the deathly hallows and i was equally anticipant i wanted to gather my thoughts before breaking new ground in the multiverse phillip pullman created the trilogy has been a favourite of mine since my first frenzied read over half my life ago my edition is a num p
2473,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,ok i ve heard a lot about this series and one of my friends dragged me to the golden compass movie which i enjoyed so i was intrigued enough to get ahold of the books i liked the golden compass i thought it followed the movie or the movie followed the book very well the places where they changed things around mostly switching the order of events seemed reasonable the story was entertaining it flowed well etc the other two weren t nearly as good if the first one was a num star boo
2474,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,it took me quite a while to read this not only is it pretty long but i read it aloud most nights to my daughter and we were both captivated plenty has already been said about the novel s anti religious message i d just add that the novel s message is basically that we should be good to each other seek the truth and rebel against cruel and tyrannical hierarchies i can see why religious authorities are upset by it the series is very inventive not content to create one world pullman creat
2475,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,i have read the first book in the trilogy and i don t understand the hype it s the story of a little girl who is always in trouble it reminded me of the comments about the lotr movies it is the story of a girl that goes from one place to another and for a practical girl with no imagination lyra is a damn good liar and story teller i think i ll read the other books but only because i m obsessed with collections and i already have them in my bookshelf i finished the second book i think i
2476,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,there were some ideas in this series i liked i loved the notion of the daemons and the talking bears were kinda cool i liked the interconnected worlds and i thought the trip to the underworld was a pretty interesting and unique take and the alethiometer was a pretty cool device tho i think that rationale for why lyra could and then couldn t read it was something of a cop out especially since the same rationale didn t hold true for others but there were so many other things about the seri
2477,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,lyra is a spirited freethinking young girl in a fantastical world where big surprise freethinking isn t exactly a good thing it took me a while to get into this book in fact it wasn t until i found out what was being done to the young children that were disappearing that i hit that can t put the book down point overall i liked the book i m glad i didn t read it when it first came out though because there are way too many cliffhangers i ve read a lot of the reviews that say the book is an
2478,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,3,the first book the golden compass is captivating one of those page turners indeed not only the setting modern era but no church reformation ever occured is enthralling but also the characters my fave is iorek byrnison a brave noble armored bear i think what makes this book a bit different with other fantasy flicks is its reference to physics as well as religion i read that pullman probably uses milton s paradise lost as his main inspiration the second book unfortunately is not as
2479,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,i don t think of hdm as a children s story i am calling it ya because that s closer to where i think you should be when reading this trilogy i think the ability to think critically and understand more complex themes is important here it is an engaging adventure story but it also speaks heavily to themes of theology and religion good vs evil ignorance vs wisdom corruption vs grace etc there s a lot of talk about hdm being anti christian and as a christian reader i can see where certain
2480,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,3,i really liked the first one but as the series went on it got harder for me to like mostly because it makes me sad that he is so angry at god that he depicts him as a usurping power grabbing being in the same category as the rest of us evolved conscious beings and through the centuries and millenia god became older and more decrepit finally being carried out on a stretcher by an enemy and dying that picture is so sad to me and one disturbing literary device is the constant back and for
2481,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,“his dark materials” by phillip pullman meet lyra belacqua she is adventurous mischievous proud and a great friend join her as she journeys through unknown worlds completely different from her own while meeting new friends as well as enemies countering lies with secrets and discovering the truth in “his dark materials” by phillip pullman lyra belacqua’s life was good at jordan college she got to explore all the time had her daemon which is your spirit but can be seen by the naked eye
2482,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,3,the golden compass five stars this first book in the series is an absolute page turner pullman shapes a truly unique story centered around a precocious child and her best friend a daemon who seems to be a physical manifestation of a piece of her own soul lyra is a young girl in a world of stuffy male scholars who takes turns trying to educate her her uncle asriel has left her in this situation but occasionally drops in to check her progress and converse with the scholars on one of his ret
2483,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,only finished the golden compass and still deciding whether i m going to power through the other two books though the story is interesting and the theme is provoking this really represents what i don t like about fantasy as much effort that has been poured into creating a new world the characters within the world are flat rigid archetypes its like their is a tolkien/c s lewis character store where writers can get cardboard cut outs of fantasy characters rename them and wedge them into ne
2484,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,his dark materials is definitively a series that needs to be read together the golden compass is definitely a first book while it does have a beginning and end of it s own contained adventure it also has a lot of world building set up that you need to keep reading to get more information on the subtle knife felt like a filler book the subtle knife the item in the book is an important piece of the overall puzzle and i understood why it had it s own book but i wish more of the overall plo
2485,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,this book took me to another world and then another world and then another one the imagination of the author is so impressive and the characters are complex interesting and very entertaining this may technically be a children s book but it s truly timeless and i recommend it to people of all ages lyra is my heroine i m still working out my reflections of this book on a religious and spiritual level i had read that the author was an atheist and was afraid he might bash god it is more
2486,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,i admit it i bought this trilogy because i was excited by the movie preview and i am generally a fan of sci fi/fantasy adventures but by the end i found myself wondering why i had so strongly recommended it to my friends well here s why num pullman is good at crafting a story the suspense of the first book is almost tangible and it is hard to put it down after starting num there is so much potential in the way it appears he will deal with quantum theory that it piqued the philosopher in me
2487,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,while this book is intended for young adults i found the writing to be well enough and the story telling masterful enough to see the entire trilogy through in a short span of time the young adult parts of the story can be irking protagonists who are actually adults in everything but their stated age adults who are children in everything but their age overly emotional dialogs and a large percentage of the events happen at the edge of the figurative precipice to keep the reader at their edge o
2488,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,ok i wish they had broken this trilogy up into three separate books on this site so i could rate them accordingly the first book was really good i really enjoyed it and i am glad i read it after i saw the movie that way i got to enjoy both the second book started off with a bang and held on to me for a while but by the end it had sunk to a new low i m not even excited about continuing the story all the atheism aside i feel like pullman created a beautiful world with very endearing chara
2489,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,1,i started reading this book and went and saw the movie because pullman wanted to write a book that was better than middle earth or narnia esp narnia because he hates those stories so i went and bought the paperback num in num trilogy here s my analysis not interesting enough to keep reading after i lost interest after the third chapter or so of the second book in the series whatever the reviews in the front say or whatever the author himself says that it s in the same league as tolkien o
2490,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,3,i think this trilogy might have received a higher rating from me if i were younger i ve loved fantasy and science fiction all my life and as a teen i would have appreciated the fucking cray cray of this storyline but it was so out there lyra and will go on an outrageous journey meet outlandish creatures/characters speak of quantum physics and other shit and deal with the land of the dead by the end i was over it i read all three back to back and by completion i wanted to strangle the
2491,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,3,just finished this last night was curious after seeing the awful movie about the author s take on atheism and a trilogy of books where someone sets out to kill god the first book the golden compass was promising enough that i decided to keep on going nice use of language overall plot and pacing not bad while the books seem to be building to a climax the battle against god is an anti climax god or the authority is an aging pretender to the title who was not the real creator of the al
2492,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,i truly enjoyed these books racing through them to capture the story and maybe to absorb the larger themes and metaphors in particular i liked how the story and its complexity continued to build throughout the books admittedly i was thinking that the books were building towards a climactic battle similar to tolkien s battle of the pelennor fields which we all know isn t the end of things quite simply put that didn t happen at all and was barely a blip in the storyline and so was t
2493,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,1,the ultra conservative right wingers are correct on this one i am not very conservative with what i read i enjoy a wide variety of books and for example am not the least bit bothered by the witchcraft in harry potter i do pre read my children s books and these were some that my oldest was interested in so i got reading i cannot recommend them at all for one thing the sheer tedium of these books has made it so i can t even finish the third book i love to read but as soon as i pick up
2494,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,i read these before there was the controversy about the athiest views of phillip pullman i feel that any piece of literature can be worked over from lots of different views and come to just as many assorted conclusions i didn t know that pullman was an athiest and therefore did not work that into my perception of the story as i read of course i could get a completely different take on it reading it a second time around with his claims about what he wanted the books to do there were parts o
2495,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,incredible it was described to me by a co worker laurence campling as something to read when you re ready to grow up from harry potter he was underselling it his dark materials is an incredible exercise in physics fantasy philosophy and above all storytelling the alternate worlds are breathtaking in their specificity as if mr pullman has been there the thoughts and motivations of the characters are deep and real the situations and decisions faced are never easy and never simple there
2496,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,1,although the first book in the trilogy was engaging i am now and have been for months stuck in the last book of the trilogy after reading others reviews i am ready to stop blaming myself for my inability to pick the book back up and finish it the last book in the series is rather awful there are many really imaginative devices and characters in these books and i have definitely been drawn to lyra through the first two books i m disappointed that lyra turned from a fiercely independent
2497,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,i decided to read this book because it appeared to be of the same genre as harry potter which i do enjoy i am a fantasy gamer always looking for a new idea this book has some good ones if mr pullman had left out his dislike of christianity and hatred of the catholic church from this book it would have been a good series as it is his random shots at church policies dishonesty and vagaries ruined much of the story for me i finished this series because i hate to leave a series unfinished and
2498,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,the first two novels are incredible and very well written the story is very original and his descriptions of super natural events make it so real i would ve given them five stars except the last book seemed too jumbled preachy and abstract for my taste i don t care what he says about it being a fantasy world with fantasy villians his disdain for god and those that believe in him comes accross very vividly in his trilogy of course pullman is intitled to freedom of press as well as opinions 
2499,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,having recently read paradise lost upon which this is loosely based i wondered why it has been taken as anti religion paradise lost has never been accused of that so i suspect that his dark materials has been wrongly aspersed ultimately the message seemed to be that it really doesn t matter who s in charge they re all just as bad as each other treating it as purely something to read without going an awful lot into its message and i m of the view that it s best not to take too many messa
2500,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,towards the latter portion of the trilogy pullman spends too much time yelling god is evil at the reader and forgets to expand and revist the unique worlds he created in the beginning of the trilogy with a name like his dark materials i think i expected something with more fantasy magic and power a compass knife and spyglass don t really seem like dark materials to me even if they do run on dust or sin or whatever dust is supposed to be i am not even sure if those items are s
2501,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,oh god yeah that ll be so funny in the context of the book i m really confused i really can t diside if reading his dark materials num years ago when i was lyra and will s age would be better one thing for sure this book not books d kicks so much ass the three parts are completely different from eachother but they flow so well together the plot is totally bonkers but the amazing characters make it so real and natural also this is the first book i have read with such strong religious th
2502,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,these books are very dear to me the first time i read them i finished the last one lying on the beach in phuket the day before the boxing day tsunami destroyed the entire beach i always think of that day and the next day and lyra and all the souls i won t say anymore the second time i read them i was disappointed in myself for letting myself read them again because the end is so distressing i get so invested in the story i love and hate the ending and i always wondered if he d continue
2503,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,first let me say that i think phillip pullman is a very gifted writer who has created a beautiful fantasy world that i enjoyed visiting but man this guy is angry at god and the church it just seethes anger just oozing off the pages then at the end he kills god outright which i thought was weird and obviously some sort of strange agenda i mean why not just create a fantasy world without god why bring it up at all i am totally anti censorship and my parents let me read anything and ev
2504,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,3,reviewing all of these at once is probably easier the first book great i was hungry for more the second book pretty good i was still interested and he did some unexpected things in the numnd book it had parts though that were just too much the third book no i didn t like it the religion or anti religion hurt the story it doesn t bother me that it s anti catholic it bothered me that he let it hurt the story that s just my opinion i bet others will disagree and more power to you for
2505,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,what a great series to read lyra makes a great a girl hero and i will have to have my daughter read it a total page turner i am currently reading the last half of the last book in the series and am still wondering what problems the church might have had with this as i only noticed this series because of warnings from the religious right of course it questions the bible s view of god and creation and the role of the church the last book seems to hurry through tying up strands of the
2506,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,the golden compass is easily my favorite of the trilogy i sat in my car in the parking lot reading the last chapter because i couldn t wait until i got home to finish it lyra is a great character and she really shines in this book the subtle knife is next in my order of preference we get to meet will and we jump between worlds but he isn t quite as compelling a character as lyra a word of caution this book ends in a horrible cliffhanger so have the last book handy the amber spyglass was
2507,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,first book num stars second book num or num stars third book num stars pullman pulls out the bucket o weird and just dumps it all over book num it works but it s borderline through books one and two it s all yaaaaay happy fun young adult fantasy novel dark themes fighting bears no love triangles no love triangles no fucking love triangles then you get to book three and it s kind of oh well this is kind of sci fi now isn t it was not prepared for this weird that and i m not crazy about
2508,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,the first book the golden compass is pretty much one of my favorite books of all time so there s that but the latter two books in the series never really live up to the first in my opinion which is upsetting they re still thrilling reads and the world s pullman has created are fantastical and gorgeously written but his super obvious anti religious/anti church/anti god agenda especially in the amber spyglass is a little too blatant for me to continue to enjoy the books as an adult i
2509,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,pullmans his dark materials trilogy is undoubtedly one of the greatest children s stories ever told and like all great works of literature it also speaks to an audience of all ages on the surface this is a tale of adventure and danger from a child s perspective but scratch the surface and suddenly you are submerged in one of the great philosophical works of our time that pullman can so expertly wrap this in an enjoyable and original children s work that rivals harry potter for sheer c
2510,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,i never read this book when i was younger i was just too old to know about it until now i read all three at once on my kindle the first thing i read on it i think it might be a bit better to put some books in between each one because these aren t really kids books they have a lot to think about and are very heavy the first book was my favorite there was a movie some years ago about the first book which is how i even found out about this book the book s better and the movie was great 
2511,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,a long and complex story that i m not sure i understood completely i listened to this trilogy over the last nine months or so and greatly enjoyed the performances given the depth of the characters the worlds they explore the forces at play and the overall themes throughout the book makes this quite a compelling read that having been said as with many who attempt large writings of analogy to make a particular point the complexity of the foundations is often overshadowed by the simplicity
2512,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,i really really enjoyed this trilogy i ve been reading a great deal of children s literature and so far this is my favorite i only had one problem and that was a missing element in the ending basically a key character/plot point was discussed throughout the three books but never seemed to come to fruition if it did it was so subtle that i overlooked it however that aside it is still worth the read this book takes you on a gripping epic adventure while asking you to consider the truth
2513,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,my friend stan raved about this trilogy it was wonderful and i should read it i started it with good intentions and the first book was solid good story believable characters but in the second novel the author s agenda started to get in the way and by the third novel i was so annoyed at the author s preaching that the romantic tragedy lost it s effect i wanted to be sad for the characters but i was too angry with the author this is definitely a case where the author s personal views
2514,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,1,i thought this trilogy was disturbing in both intent and content i read it because i wanted to defy the right wing boycott and i had to force myself to finish the numrd installment i e push through boredom lethargy it s hard to discern why these are marketed to children/tweens because they re really just poorly written pages of words whose hateful subtlety is directed at other like minded adults and would be lost on kids anyway mostly i ve never read a book and felt that much despai
2515,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,loved loved loved it i was transported to another world with daemons and witches and iorek byrnison i imagined myself as a child to be lyra silvertongue it is just a wonderful magical and vivid adventure i couldn t put it down and when i was finished i immediately picked up the second book in the series and when i finished that one while at work i called my girlfriend to get the third from our neighbor who was reading them just ahead of me i did find the ending to be a bit disappo
2516,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,1,i hate this series with a passion it wasn t fun it didn t go anywhere there was absolutely no closure whatsoever in the end not only are the children robbed of the element that made them special in order for an author to make some stupid self aggrandizing childish senselessly vindictive point but the young couple is forced apart for the same exact idiotic reason for these reasons and many others i will never read this author/series ever again i despise authors who forget one of the pr
2517,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,1,i stayed far away from the controversy surrounding pullman before i read these books i wanted to judge the books on their merit alone and not be influenced by pop culture and opinion pieces having said that… i’ll save everyone the long winded diatribe i’d like to write here and just say that the time i spent reading this book ranks among the top num in my “biggest wastes of time” list i will never get that time back i hated this entire series i choked it down because i can’t bear to leave a
2518,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,having heard so many good things i really wanted to like this series and for most of book num i did the premise is interesting the world building and detail are original and lyra is a likable heroine by the end of book num however the plot is starting to fall apart in books num and num pullman s message has run away with him and overwhelmed plot and character entirely i don t have a problem with his anti organized religion stance itself or with wanting to send that message to teens via a
2519,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,i won t cheat and write three different reviews for each of these books instead i shall treat them as one the story of lyra and her world is incredibly rich with each character in each of the books treated individually giving them an amazing depth that is so often neglected in other children s books the themes too are not just about the classic good versus evil which is a staple of the genre in this new age of children s literature but instead require the reader to look beyond the two dimens
2520,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,maybe some day i d be able to get my thoughts together sit down and write a proper review for his dark materials but having just finished the trilogy one word comes to mind to describe it monumental it s an epic piece of literature that every child needs to read before growing up i m only sorry i didn t really know about it when i was at the right age i would have been thoroughly addicted it s a fine amalgam of fantasy spirituality science and coming of age romance that would undoubted
2521,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,1,don t waste your time horrible books young reader level suggestion no young readers would totally get this series fo books so so dark and the adult characters a pure evil if you enjoy adults killing children knck yourself out i read them because the movie looked good and i wanted to read them before it came out i read all three because i wanted to know how it all worked out but didn t enjoy reading them at all don t let the movie fool you the books are nothing like the movie as usu
2522,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,this trilogy was nothing short of amazing for me anyway but i have to be honest normally when religious fanatics decry something with language like trying to preach an atheistic message i would say that the critics are wildly overreacting in this case though it s more than atheism without giving too much away the god of abraham yahweh yhwh jehovah just call me god does exist and is malevolent if you re a christian chances are you re not going to want to support this franchi
2523,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,i still can t believe i read these as a kid the amount of quantum everything in them blew my adult mind so i m not even sure how my kid mind handled them what a wonderful way to introduce those concepts though setting them into an active story makes them so much more tangible and understandable quantum entanglement particle physics string theory parallel universes not to mention a brilliant plot and incredibly imaginative and vivid writing i could not recommend these books enough 
2524,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,4,an incredible series that goes straight to the heart of what makes us human there s no pussyfooting around here these books are an elegant look at desire morality and the soul topics which are usually skirted around in contemporary novels i found the ending of the series to be a touch disappointing but considering the overall quality of the books my expectations were perhaps too high endings are hard to pull off as much as i love harry potter it s a shame these didn t get the worldwid
2525,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,a brilliant trilogy which i got so into especially during the subtle knife and couldn t put down during the third book i grew so attached to the characters and so immersed in the story line that i just couldn t stop reading it has been a while since i have read them and i look forward to coming back to this amazing trilogy in the future i recommend these books to anyone who is interested because they really are something you don t want to miss less scoresby will always be my favourite cha
2526,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,1,his dark materials is a trilogy consisting of three titles the golden compass the subtle knife the amber spyglass no books are ever written in a vacuum ultimately they reflect the moral or philosophical ideas of the author sometimes blatantly stated and other times subtly implanted in his dark materials god is an impostor of the worst type a created being claiming to be the creator he has deceived the entire multiuniverse which has now been torn apart by dangerous people using d
2527,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,yeah i don t remember god dying in these books i read them all it got a bunch of fuss in the press over it from what i understood it was lucifer that died i thought yeah the ending was sort of confusing and the angel xaphania is a bitch seriously that having been said i love the hell out of these books the movie is probably subpar but the books are exquisite and deep and metaphorical and wondrous it makes me squeal that they have received the attention that they have 
2528,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,if asked to review the golden compass my opinion would be much different than it is toward the trilogy the first book was interesting rich and compelling but after that it goes downhill the subtle knife is still pretty good but the amber spyglass became awkward and overbearing it felt like being force fed some grand perception of an imaginary universe even though it left plot holes gaping wide and the whole idea of a compelling story in the dust i wasn t satisfied at the end 
2529,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,i know everyone just loved this trilogy and they couldn t get enough so much that it just had to be made into a movie i am sorry but i really did not see what all the fuss was about and frankly i found the little girl lyra to be quite annoying especially in the golden compass i found it to be extremely slow reading and to be very honest with you i forced myself to keep reading but i just could not do it toward the end and so gave up with probably only num pages or so left to read 
2530,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,2,sorry guys but this trilogy just doesn t do it for me i was well aware of the anti god message the author was attempting to push out before i even began the reading it was the the writing itself that i found disappointing there was simply too much flitting around from one world to another trying to sum up a great understanding of what it all meant to the main character the first two books ended horribly leaving the reader with no resolution to probems they came across in the reading and fr
2531,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,1,there s a reason i couldn t even get through northern lights in two months i m sorry but this just wasn t interesting or well written it was full of exposition the chosen one protagonists are always the dullest because there s never any suspense or intrigue around their narrative you know everything is going to work out fine for them they re only as interesting as the events and characters happening around them see jon snow/daenerys again i think this is my fault for choosing ya whe
2532,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,1,pullman s writing could be described as flavorful and entertaining in the golden compass it was a steep and downward slope from there the idea of our souls displaced outside of us and being given a visual identity is creative the idea of a knife that cuts through planes is not new but still fascinating the rest was junk this series is the product of a man who was deeply hurt by religion and wants to destroy it the author s sulking made the books intolerable but i finished them anyway d
2533,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,1,philip pullman i m deeply unimpressed i read your trilogy i got attached to lyra and will just to see you fuck up their lives in a final plot that was as unnecessary as it was incomplete dafuq happened to the prophecy dafuq happened with these num lovable characters who we have no closure for had u spent half the time on character development that you did on criticizing christianity we wouldn t be making this rant shame on you for making me love num characters and then abandoning them like n
2534,His Dark Materials,Philip Pullman,5,i thoroughly enjoyed reading the golden compass and cannot wait to read the rest of the trilogy that said given the buildup i was a wee bit dissappointed ok months later i m reading the subtle knife and find it captivating i can t put it down well obviously i can or i d be done by now but it s great i finished the subtle knife i liked it better even than the golden compass i can t wait to read the next one 
2535,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,num num/num stars i have this belief that num of the time standalone high fantasy just won’t satisfy me i still stand by it but tigana luckily is not one of those cases memories and names something that breathes life into the people and possessions we lost both of these can be summed up as the fabric of identity despite all the war deaths sex hardships betrayal magic deception subterfuge the main essence of tigana is reclaiming your freedom home memories and the implication of holding
2536,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,while reading this book over the past month i thought a lot about the differences between youth and adulthood between young beliefs and mature ones and i think that maybe our youth is the only time that we can hold simple firm convictions maybe it’s the only time that it’s possible to believe completely that love will conquer all or that there are good guys and bad guys or that if we try hard enough we can achieve anything we dream about in our youth we can say things like “ i would ne
2537,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,1,i hated this book but i m an oddity in fact virtually every other human being seems to love it unconditionally so if you stumble upon it give it a try chances are you ll find it awesome so what didn t i like about it well pretty much everything this book in short tells about the vengeful crusade of a group of refugees from the once great city of tigana destroyed years before by the mage brandin cool uh nope for starters nobody cares about the destruction of tigana in fact the pro

2540,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,the greatest strength of tigana guy gavriel kay s masterpiece is the ambiguity of his characters ethics fantasy as a genre suffers from the widespread simplicity of its expressions of good and evil kay consistently transcends this genre weakness and tigana marks his first and greatest break with the good vs evil tradition tigana is full of characters who struggle with their decisions and the impact those decisions have on others alessan the hero of the piece enslaves a wizar
2541,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5, num num a buddy read with the fantasy buddy reads group because we wanted a stand alone for a change how do i even start on writing a review for this book i think just as most everyone else has done i have to begin with the style of writing it is a throwback to a time long past it carries a lyrical magic which simmers in every sentence and without being in itself overly flowery it conveyed a sense of gothic melodrama which made me feel as if a bard of old was telling the story of

2544,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,what more can be said other than everyone should read this book at least once get a feel for the beauty of language and images in motion you won t be disappointed guy gavriel kay is a great prose writer it doesn t even matter if fantasy isn t your thing because this book does not read like fantasy it reads like the sort of well written historical fiction that weaves in myths to tell the tales of a lost time a personal favorite combination i must admit also i m coming off of a dramatic
2545,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,it s been long time since i read standalone fantasy book so far i mostly avoided kay for no particular reason and i came into possession of this book almost by accident what a happy accident it was as this turned out to be wonderful and pretty unique book i already encountered combination of heroic fantasy characters in grimdark setting from another canadian author steven erikson but kay does it with his own unique flavor world building in this book is just wonderful without too detailed desc
2546,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5, tigana is the first book i have read by guy gavriel kay i have heard of tigana book from brandon sanderson he recommends lists of books to his fans to read tigana is one of lists he has recommended i love this book so much alhamdulillah i am surprise that guy gavriel kay s books aren t well recognized and i really love his writing style too alhamdulillah there is a few authors who i love their writing style bram stoker j r r tolkien james clavell guy gavriel kay robert jordan brandon sand
2547,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,the peninsula of the palm is a place divided but not against itself its nine provinces are occupied territory under the power of foreign wizards brandin of ygrath holds the east while alberico of barbadior holds the west each state has been allowed to maintain its identity except for one cursed to oblivion but a few people remember they are determined to get their home back and to free the entire palm in the process before i can say anything else i have to gush about the writing
2548,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,i m giving this book a num rating despite not being sure until the very last chapter about if it would be a num s or num num s or num s i was pretty sure by the time i finished up the book that it was a solid num s but i then read the author s afterword and he states all of his influences and what he wanted to achieve with the book and i decided that this had to be a num book because i totally understood where he was coming from and it really resonated true with me this book certainly feels a lot more hist
2549,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,a masterpiece teeming with richness complexity beauty sorrow courage love heartbreak poetry brutality and transcendence one of the finest books i’ve ever read 
2550,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,before reading tigana it was inconceivable for me to picture a stand alone fantasy book without any intention or hope of a series i often wondered how it would be possible to create a whole new world in just one book and give it a satisfactory ending when i read this book i finally understood tigana is not a book it is a journey a journey through the lives of men and their emotions a journey of wonder a journey of pain and a journey of understanding rarely do you come across a book as
2551,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,num num this book is epic believe all the hype stars tigana is a book that will put you through all the emotions that exist i am seriously exhausted in a good way reading this book was a great experience some of the best characters that i have read in a long time the story build up is awesome to epic proportions by the time the book reached its climax i was all clammy palmed stuttering heart hanging from the edge of my seat no fingernails not bitten to stubbs at all but something fell a no
2552,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,2,i really liked the ideas behind this story—the power of names in the face of colonialism in the face of enforced forgetfulness—but there was just too much in the writing that worked against my enjoyment of it kay s style has improved from what it was in the fionavar series but it s still clunky and laboured and desperately in need of some commas while the world building is pedestrian and two dimensional many of the better drawn characters are unengaging and most of the cast are such clic
2553,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,i really can t decide whether to rate this a num or num star but i ll go with num there is more that i like about this book than dislike overall i love the story it is quite the epic and it seems a waste of great worldbuilding to contain it to one volume on the other hand it is good to see such a marvelous work that stands on its own without a dozen sequels prequels and hard to find novellas in fantasy that is a rare treat still this is a world i d like to visit again someday the story i
2554,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,reading tigana was like sipping liquid chocolate exquisite i found myself many times deeply and profoundly moved kay was able to communicate the profound sense of loss felt by a dispossessed people and without the aid of music or even lyrics bring the music within the book alive to touch the imagination i felt the mournful tones of the pipes and the heart wrenching voice of devin as he sings kay makes us imagine what it would be like if the memory of your home is removed not only from your
2555,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,good book terrific finish this is my second book by the author and has me wondering if i should reread the lions of al rassan often in life somebody s best trait is also their worst when they take it to the extreme kay is this way with his verbose depictions of his worlds often their brilliant and then i want to eventually strangle him for not moving on at some point you have to trust the reader gets it the story in this was compelling and the world robust but what really made it was that
2556,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,it says that i read this back in january num it would be more accurate to say that i ve read this book since january num i ve read this book no less than ten times i own the numth anniversary edition as well now because i expect my first one to fall apart very soon it s lost at least one cover being passed around among all my friends throughout high school one day i will write a real review of this just can t put my thoughts together yet 
2557,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,i first heard about guy gavriel kay shortly after joining goodreads and have just finally managed to get around to reading my first book it won t be the last tigana was a wonderful reading experience complex nuanced characters captured my heart and i hoped against hope that everyone could somehow be saved in the end it was beautiful and tragic full of loss hope and redemption i wanted to spend more time in the aftermath and follow them all home it finished too soon 
2558,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,this is the first book by kay i ve ever read and one of only three books on my shelves signed by the author one of only two signed specifically to me and the only one i actually got myself its size is daunting if you re not a regular fantasy reader but it s a stand alone novel and would be disappointing if it were any shorter tigana is about a great many things but the central plot and theme of the novel is the subjugation of the people of the peninsular of the palm modelled after italy
2559,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,this story is at its essence about how the past influences the present the protagonists are driven to reclaim their homeland not just from a conquering army but from a magical spell that prevents others from remembering or even hearing their homeland s name tigana within a generation any knowledge of their land its history and culture will be forever lost instead of a fast paced sword and sorcery story tigana is rather reflective there are several pov characters that spend a good deal

2562,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,if goodreads had half stars i would have dropped this to only num num/num but more on that below tigana is among the handful of fantasy novels that can make me wonder whether tolkien is as good as i remember him or as good as his reputation it has been many years since i read lord of the rings and i almost never re read books so i might never find out perhaps tolkien is like shakespeare — it is easy to convince oneself that it is just hype that he really can’t be all that astonishingly good b

2570,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,the premise of tigana is one of the most interesting backbones for a fantasy story i’ve seen in a while the palm is being invaded by two competing foreign magicians one of them is brandin better known as ‘the tyrant’ the province of tigana holds out for a long time winning a big battle to keep their independence and killing brandin s favourite son in the process burning with rage brandin takes charge of the war himself and ends it in a dramatic way the province is under his control the
2571,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,executive summary an enjoyable stand alone fantasy book that is a little uneven in places but really brings shades of gray to the characters and the story audio book simon vance seems like the perfect reader for this book i first encountered him as part of the great ensemble readers for dune i don t recall any particular voices of note however he does do scottish accents for folks from the highlands overall i think he does an excellent job that is a good fit for the tone of the story f

2574,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,shoot i m writing this review way too late tigana deserved all the five stars i gave it and then some the writing was fantastic and intricate i immediately fell for the characters and the world building was detailed but presented well if you know how much i hate info dumps and how often it happens in fantasy then you ll appreciate when a book does it well my most favourite part about this book was how it toyed with my perceptions of characters we read one point of view and think this

2581,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,originally posted at fantasy literature nobody remembers tigana — a land bright with beauty culture and wealth — nobody but those who lived there before the land was cursed by the conqueror brandin of ygrath after the prince of tigana killed brandin s son in battle when the now oppressed tiganese try to tell outsiders about tigana the name just slips out of the listener s mind only those born in the land are able to keep its beautiful name in memory but the prince of tigana s son still live

2586,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,2,this book was trying to be beautiful and make me love it with its writing while dragging and having characters that make wish for magic to be used on me so i can forget them and what they did 
2587,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,tigana is a land forgotten by most through magical means the naming of which unlocks the memories of those who belonged to it i feel at the end of this book as though something has been unlocked in me a coming home to something i didn t know i loved yes i liked it this much it is an experience i want to share with others who have journeyed here before me and that i wish to gift to someone who has not yet gone one of the best fantasy book i have ever read and quite possibly of any genre be
2588,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,3,fantasy isn t a genre i m normally drawn to but decided to choose this for a reading challenge it s been in my to be read mountain of books for ages and i haven t read anything by the author before tigana was a long and convoluted read this was the story of a quest of a land that had been forgotten by many due to the machinations of an evil sorcerer it s a story of memory lost and gained a story of good triumphing over evil against insurmountable odds strangely enough it was the tyrant/s
2589,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,god i loved this book i couldn t decide between four stars and five but i went with five since it made me cry three times one of the things that most impressed me with this story was how smooth and polished the whole thing was although it gathered momentum as it went it never really ebbed and flowed in the telling it just went along smooth and graceful from beginning to end i listened to the audio book which i couldn t recommend more the narrator s voice was smooth and somewhat orator
2590,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,the afterword on the audiobook was such a wonderful addition to this novel the author tries to recall what caused him to write this story about a country losing its identity the thoughtful examples added a great deal to the story 
2591,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,there was no way i was not going to love this book experience has shown that i love guy gavriel kay and the characters he comes up with they are without exception passionate people and i love reading about passionate people especially when they have a cause and boy do the characters in this book have a cause can you say epic cause tigana is the name of one of the countries of the palm a peninsula loosely based on renaissance italy divided and distrustful of one another and unlikely
2592,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,i’m going num num on this high fantasy with that numth star flickering but i don’t think it made it if this book was num pages shorter and wasn’t as in depth in some of the lands it would have been a flat out num for me the story of tigana is a world where a very strong sorcerer had removed the memories of a country from everyone’s mind except from the people who lived there only the people that lived there can even understand when someone says the word tigana the sole remaining prince of tigana sets
2593,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,this review was written in the late nineties for my eyes only and it was buried in amongst my things until recently when i uncovered the journal in which it was written i have transcribed it verbatim from all those years ago although square brackets may indicate some additional information for the sake of readability or some sort of commentary from now this is one of my lost reviews i loved being surprised like this every once in a while someone out of the ordinary suggests a book to me
2594,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,i ll be honest i didn t think i was going to like this book much when i first started reading it the descriptions of devin and his singing group left me uninspired i felt like i was looking at yet another fantasy world of magic and towers and bards and despots without much new then the hunting lodge and it all turned the themes of identity and country and suppression played on many things i ve studied or thought about and i loved the depth in which kay treated them within his otherwise famil
2595,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,tigana is one of my favorite books in the world exquisitely written magnificently peopled set in a land and the ghost of a land i only wish i could get to powerful doesn t seem to quite describe it there is a battle near the end which left me literally breathless the first time i read it my heart was pounding i couldn t catch my breath i couldn t read fast enough nothing remotely like it has happened with any other book i ve read and i ve read a lot of books i can t think of anoth
2596,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,full review to come but guy gavriel kay is definitely a new favourite author 
2597,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,dh is the one i have to thank for first introducing me to guy gavriel kay s body of work he was a fan of the fionavar tapestry and felt sure i would like them and like them i did so much so that i immediately went and read kay s slightly later work tigana originally published in num tigana is an epic romantic fantasy and was nominated for both the world fantasy award and the mythopoeic fantasy award the story takes place in the peninsula of the palm a world based on medieval italy like
2598,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,“tigana let my memory of you be like a blade in my soul ” this is the story of a beleaguered land struggling to be free it is the tale of a people so cursed by the black sorcery of their invader that even the name of their once beautiful homeland cannot be spoken or remembered after years of hopeless struggle a handful of men and women plot to overthrow their conquerors and bring back to the world the brilliance of a long lost name tigana the palm had nine provinces of which tigana now lo
2599,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,2,tigana has been mentioned as one of the greatest fantasy books of all time a staple in the genre and an absolute must read for fantasy fans it is described as lyrical poetic heartfelt and beautiful how could i not give it a try we are thrown into the middle of things at the beginning of the book and have to work out what is going on for ourselves you have to really pay attention and remember little details to be able to understand later conversations yet even then the dialogue is crypti
2600,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,i m finding it really hard to say how i felt about this book i did enjoy it and found it engaging throughout but now a couple hours later i don t feel anything about it i didn t take anything of value away from my reading it has left no impression upon me it is yet another story of the survivors of an occupation by a foreign tyrant biding their time before they can overthrow their ruler and reclaim their land nothing new in that part how it differs is their land was not only overrun but
2601,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,1,i like books by guy gavriel kay so i was looking forward to reading this one and i tried to like it i really did but i m not sure i ever had much of a chance since my biggest problem with the book was essentially the entire premise of the story tigana is a place that has been conquered but they fought back and killed the tyrants son conquering tyrant comes to seek vengeance but doesn t stop at just slaughtering everyone and leveling the place nope he casts a spell to make everyone forget
2602,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,fantasy or more aptly coined as escapist fiction is one i relish for the simple reason that they pull me out of the clutches of the pragmatic and bland everyday world and plunge me headlong into a colorful world this was exactly what i had in mind when i picked tigana up to read the book proved me wrong fantasy here is but a mirror that reflects in many a way the itlay of the renaissance the india under the british raj and so many other facets of world history the simple but brutally hones
2603,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,a another good historical fantasy novel from kay it was the type of book that had you really thinking about how much memory places in our actions the book raised many thought provoking questions for me can you really rewind to the past to try to bring back a cultural that is now buried is belief enough to ultimately claim victory can you make a tyrant more humane in the reader s eyes can you love someone who has done terrible things at times the threads of the story could seem disconnected
2604,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,3,num num stars i do like the book else i d probably either skim over it or not finish it altogether but not enough to really like it i understand the premise of this book which has an important message to tell the afterword by the author explains it quite well too this is a well written book in general and there are parts which really pull on my emotions and make me reflect on it afterwards for awhile the love story here is one of the most fatally tragic ones i ve read but somehow i can t re
2605,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,absolutely beautiful this is a book i will definitely be reading again 
2606,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,at the more traditional and dull end of the fantasy genre we have writers writing redundant hero journeys full of elves and dwarves and other cutesy races then at the other end we have gritty realism with very few fantastic elements and an inversion of the hero journey storyline either the heroes are croaking at a rapid rate think martin or the heroes are well not heroes at all when you get down to it and are incapable of growth think abercrombie tigana captures what is best from
2607,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,review to come next week 
2608,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,ugh this book was gorgeous i actually really liked it from the look of the summary on the back of the book itself i thought this was going to be a slow moving and dry read boy was i ever wrong the characters the characters devin had me gushing in an altogether fangirlish way every other page well for the sections that were in his pov catriana had me cheering this is how you write female characters steven moffat take notes i don t think i ve ever seen characters like alessan and
2609,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,i found tigana annoying me so much this time around kay s overly ornate way of writing the way he makes even the simplest of events sound so deeply important by the formal way he s writing but it all came together for me again when i sat down and just read i fell in awkward torn love with alessan with brandin with catriana with dianora with baerd i loved the way people came together willingly and unwillingly against the other halves of their hearts i love how people became whole a
2610,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,3,i have never understood fantasy and people s fascination towards it at the beginning of this year resolved to tackle the genres i avoid and obviously fantasy stood prominent this is my numrd fantasy book the eye of the world and game of thrones being the other num was happy to know that it is a standalone the story is set in an alternative world a place with num moons which has been sundered apart by battling warlords there are num provinces partitioned by num lords brand in of ygarth and alberi
2611,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,3,i didn t love this book as much as everyone else seemed to it s a fantasy novel set in an oppressed land a region much like italy is ruled by two sorcerers and we follow a group of rebels who want to free the land from their tyranny the rebels are from the tigana region but one of the sorcerers eliminated all memory of it from everyone who was born outside that region a large part of their motivation was restoring the memory of their once great land to the rest of the country i found it h
2612,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,okay i see why people call this ggk s best work it s certainly wonderful and epic in scope personally i m drawn more to his books that are more deeply rooted in a particular time period however this is renaissance italy but a loose version thereof all the same it s wonderful as so worth reading if you re intimidated by the length of the read simon vance does the audio and he is so wonderful 
2613,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,oh tigana you have my heart the heart that is both broken and joyous after the end i don t know if i can do justice to the beauty you offered me within the pages but i will try and write a review soon 
2614,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,i loved this book i loved it because it was wholesome and puerile which is a bad way to begin because i m sure that plenty of readers will take wholesome and puerile as insults and i don t meant them that way at all this book seemed to me to have the spirit of a lively chivalrous teenage boy which i found utterly charming set in a fantasy world loosely based on renaissance italy the story concerns the peninsula of the palm which is currently being oppressed by two opposing tyrants ou
2615,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,i had trouble rating this as generously as others have as a fantasy story or a thick complex allegory or as the literary novel that mr kay describes in the afterword to my edition it was all just good there were a number of things that got in my way num it s an epic story and a character study but it is told in such a way that it just builds up steam as an epic fantasy when it shifts gears into character study then back and again so for my calcifying brain it was a constant case of
2616,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,originally posted here my husband is a self confessed high fantasy purist and i would have to give him credit for my sustained interest in and appreciation for the genre true i haven t read a lot of high fantasy books compared to him or some of my other bookish friends but i d like to think that the few i have read are some of the best works there are i also turn to the genre every once in a while whenever inspiration strikes so when the book club courtesy of moderators aaron and jl pic
2617,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,i recently bought a used copy of this book in memory of how much i remember reading this the first time made me bawl my eyes out i don t really remember specifics of the story but the overall strokes it was sweeping and beautiful and hit quite close to home due to the injustice done to those in tigana and how i paralleled it to general local sabahan/north borneo sentiment regarding the dark times in our history num/num there is something here to write about but maybe not in this review an
2618,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,num num rounding it off to num thanks to the last part which scored extra brownie points here tigana was a good read i liked the complex plot writing was beautiful and the end was absolutely mind blowing characters were good but i felt dianora s character was portrayed the best however having said that i did find it dragging in the middle the story line went slack and there were suddenly these whole new set of characters being introduced and bit too frequently dianora s part was the best in
2619,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,another book from ggk that i really enjoyed i m not sure what is about his writing style or plotting but i was instantly hooked much like when reading his sarantine mosaic books i think a political intrigue plot like the one in tigana could easily fall into a trap where everything goes too perfectly or that high risk events happen despite being planned years in advance but the pace and the twists in this book kept the pieces moving while never letting you see the whole board i thought the

2621,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,what would you do if your very roots were obliterated from the pages of history how would you feel if your every memory is yours alone something that cannot be shared even if you wanted to what would it mean to you if you were from a place that no one remembers how would you live if your entire life were to depend on not being annihilated by those who want you gone forever questions like these and the answers to some of them are what you find in this magnum opus by kay tigana is a story o
2622,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,1,if i had to describe this book with only two words i would use contrived and misogynist if i had to describe the male characters in one word i would say self entitled the female characters cardboard as hard as i tried to like this book every page was a struggle and i m not even sure i can fully articulate everything i despised about it but i will try in this review beware that there are some spoilers the book fails to supply a base for all of its exaggerated emotional outbursts 
2623,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,a sprawling and intense epic read that is delightfully well contained this could easily have been stretched out exhaustingly over several books but thankfully it wasn’t the author goes hard with the prose at times but it feels appropriate for a story with such heavy emotional themes sometimes there were almost too many names and too much history being thrown at me which made it a struggle for my eternally distracted self but after pushing through i found a striking story about erasure r

2626,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,this is the fourth book i’ve read by guy gavriel kay and he continues to blow me away this guy can write i truly truly mean that tigana was first published back in num i was only two and has been considered by many to be one of the best stand alone fantasy novels ever written while i thought that there were some overly dramatic elements and some minor plot issues it’s almost impossible to fault it due to the amazing prose found within the story centers on the eight provinces that make u
2627,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,excellent as a fellow canadian i was of course not surprised at the quality of this book we all pretty much write like this… i enjoyed kay s fionavar tapestry but tigana is a tour de force and in a single novel mind you not a decology in my view kay matured as a writer and it shows when you compare this to his earlier work i can relate to another goodreads review of tigana in which the reviewer questions how good tolkien really was after reading tigana he who comes first is often regard
2628,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,i really did enjoy reading this really while it is based on fantasy the main theme throughout the book is about love and loyalty to individuals to family to country to the living and the dead i kept asking myself who were the victims where did my loyalties lie there where a few people worthy of both on both sides of the divide it was one of those books that left you with a satisfied feeling at the end the end surprised me so i give nothing away by saying that one thing i did like
2629,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,if you want more stories like the lord of the rings with a scruffy even tempered lost prince fighting to regain his homeland from sorcerers then tigana is for you in this case one sorcerer has even eradicated the name of his homeland and only with his death will it be remembered however said sorcerer is not portrayed as evil and to me this is where the story grew interesting he was simply angry over the death of his son in battle and in grief he enacted his revenge against tigana the
2630,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,it was good really good but the authors ponderous occasionally convoluted style prevents him getting a five ten percent shorter this would have been an even better book rich involved plot with complex characters more than needed perhaps evokes more robert jordan than j r r tolkien even though he assembled a band of odd personages reminiscent of the fellowship of the ring midway kay seemed to lose lost track of his own plot for the fun of developing ancillary characters all the backgr
2631,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,2,i got halfway into this and then just didn t want to read it any more i m not sure what went wrong well i mean i guess part of what went wrong was that the characters seemed to be sort of blundering into things i had just finished the scene where the dude gets seduced by whatsername and then there s this whole scene where baerd goes for a walk and runs into a secret cult of magic warriors who have been coincidentally waiting for years for him to come along and lead them to glory so he d
2632,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,3,i heard a lot of good things about guy gavriel kay so when i picked this up i was anxious to read it at first i hated the book the characters seemed all over the place with their moods going from exuberance to depression to anger in seconds they also seemed to do the same in love one minute loving one person then another at first i was sure devin and catriana were going to get over their hate for each other and they almost did until devin met another girl and suddenly catriana was in love
2633,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,i really enjoyed this book tigana is set in a medieval or renaissance world in a planet orbited by two moons and with some of the most unforgettable characters the characters are all so meticulously developed they aren t all good or bad they are all just so human this is not a typical fantasy book it does have some magic but it is the people and their conflicts that drive the story dianora is my favourite character in this book her inner conflicts and her story arc really made the book
2634,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,there has long been a backlash on the internet for people s tendency to overuse the term epic well despite that the only adjective appropriate to describe tigana is epic it is epic fantasy of the highest order the writing is poetic the characters are deep the plot is complex and the stakes are high without being mired in most of the evil plan tropes that most heroic fantasy suffers from it is one of the greatest fantasy stories ever told and i couldn t recommend it more highly 
2635,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,this book was absolutely amazing it s a nice change of pace to read a self contained fantasy novel this story revolves around a fictional land divided between two conquering sorcerer rulers and one group of people trying to bring their home land s name back into the world the characters are gripping and the writing is so rich and detailed i loved every minute of it and it makes me sad that i ll never experience reading tigana for the first time again a 
2636,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,this was the first novel i read by guy gavriel kay it s also the most emotional novel i ve ever read kay s characters are so well drawn they seem real and you really care about them it s a wonderful powerful heartbreaking story the last num pages are incredible even if fantasy isn t your bag it is masterful storytelling and you would do yourself a great disservice by not reading it

2659,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,i loved loved loved this book so much so i had to look up one and two star reviews of tigana to see what people could possibly have against it do other people do that or is it simply a wierd habit of mine the main reason some disliked it was it appears lack of action at the beginning making it difficult to get into well true it isn t a book for an action junkie its much deeper than that kay does give the background story to each person and to each new event slowly bringing together the

2664,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,why oh why have i put off reading guy gavriel kay for so long i am kicking myself but at least now i have found my way story tigana is a true delicacy the prose is beautiful elegant and enchanting i ve not read a standalone novel with such depth of worldbuilding and meaning there is action fighting music subterfuge magic twists suffering pain and love this book moved me in a way that really took me by surprise something about the oppressed fighting for freedom always gets me go
2665,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,1,it was written well enough the commas were in the right places the paragraphs looked right from a distance and the weight of the volume was adequate to let you know you were holding a real live book i almost never review a book i couldn t finish but here i am going at for the sake of other fantasy readers there s nothing here that couldn t have been produced by a fantasy book writing machine it s the same general land the same kind of magic the same level of technology the same the sa
2666,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,i’ll keep this short and sweet tigana was a beautiful sad and exhilarating story the writing was very descriptive with a good sense of place and the character development was amazing i loved following the story from different viewpoints and having the chance to understand all sides in the painful war that occurred prior and rebellion which eventually followed i would have given tigana top marks if it wasn’t for the over describing of lands and politics which slowed things down for me more t

2675,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,right after finishing this book the only words i could come up with to describe it were wow holy f cking wow indeed those words were my constant refrain throughout the whole story i ll try to be more coherent here but i know that no review could really do justice to how brilliant this novel is a new favorite on the front cover of the numth anniversary edition of this book there is a review by another author that says one of the best fantasy novels i have read i won t hesitate to echo
2676,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,2,while it’s not a bad book this novel is for me a study of what prevents a fantasy novel from attaining the heights of mastery it looks like kay had learned during this process while working on this book and delivered the lions of al rassan six years later which i loved that result was a focused compelling work without extraneous and distracting events or characters as for this i skimmed the last num/num nevertheless writing a review helps me think through what worked and what didn’t in n

2678,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,3,my ideal kind of fantasy is just historical fantasy set on earth but low magic secondary world settings strongly based on history are almost as good and two of the most highly regarded authors and fantasy happen to write just that sort of world but unfortunately for me from my one book experience with each guy gavriel kay suffers from some of the same problems as kj parker tigana is another thrones like a historicist fantasy about political intrigue and strategy in deciding the fate of an
2679,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,wow what a trip that was i will seek other books by this author as it was my current edition of tigana was a tenth anniversary edition with an interesting afterword by the author the original publication was in num what a great resource goodreads is to discover books one would never otherwise not know about fantasy with historical overtones is tigana 
2681,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,after reading the numth book written by kay this year i decided to rewrite my reviews they could of course never do justice to his books but at least i try harder tigana is one powerful story that i am sure will appeal to more than fantasy fans it is a story that is set in another realm with magic and powers and different orders but it is all still about human sometimes by borrowing those strange elements from the other world it brings us closer to understand ourselves to realize how v
2682,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,i don t read a lot of high fantasy novels because i m more of a contemporary romance kind of person and because of that it takes me a while to really get into a world especially one that required maps and had different names of people with powers and such i noticed that a lot of high fantasy novels often had a lot of characters too with odd names to boot so sometimes i feel like i need to get into a different kind of mindset before i take on a high fantasy novel hah i feel like i sou

2685,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,1,it s not that tigana defied my expectations or misled me i clearly understood what the author wanted me to believe it just failed to convince me to buy anything it was selling namely i wound up disliking the protagonists and cheering for the tyrant this is purposefully done by the author but he wildly overshot his mark he lost me the moment one of our heroes enslaves another character in the name of his cause it left an extremely nasty taste in my mouth and i never got past it he the

2687,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,3,audiobook version this was an unfortunate choice for an audiobook the characters were intricate and there were several i really cared about the settings were well done but on audio it did not work for me for a couple of reasons it was difficult to follow with family interruptions and the names were so odd that i had trouble keeping people clear other reviewers mentioned the complexity of characters the reason i bought this but i was underwhelmed it is true the good weren t flawle
2688,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,2,this book actually compels me to write my first review on goodreads it was just so annoying to read that i can t leave it uncommented first the prose the wording often is over the top pompous using the cheapest analogies throughout the author is trying desperately to convey dense moods but utterly fails by overburdening the reader with heaps of schmaltzy adjectives here is the first sentence of chapter num in the autumn season of the wine word went forth from among the cypresses and oliv
2689,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,2,man it took forever to finish this one a standalone fantasy novel can be really good under the right conditions this one is considered legendary by many but to me it just got bogged down in uninteresting filler material tigana is the tale of a land locked within a brutal feudalistic society it is the tale of a people whose home has been erased as two evil totalitarian despots vie against one another in a power struggle these two tyrants are essentially kings ruling with virtually absolut
2690,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,tigana is a novel of many ideas it s a novel about identitiy about culture and about having one s culture and identity taken away stolen from them before they even knew it existed what would you do well if you re anything like the chracters in this novel you will fight back you will do your best to remind the world of your country your culture and your name where to even begin here well tigana is a piece of fantasy written by guy gavriel kay inspiried by midieval italy we are intr
2691,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,3,i might warm up on the second reading to this one i did with the other novel by kay that i have read song for arbonne or not maybe my opinion won t change maybe it will for now i remember is as a good story that failed to draw me in perhaps i just couldn t resonate with the characters one question what is with the incest and fantasy books does every sister have to sleep with her brother this reminds me of the songs of ice and fire watched it not read it i might read it off course
2692,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,3,tigana is a good fantasy novel that s hindered by occasional pov fatigue—shifting erratically even frantically at times much of tigana is worthwhile and most of it is enjoyable i d comfortably recommend this book to any fan of epic fantasy especially as it s its own complete entity no ten part series here just a solitary work however i did feel that some sections of the story were throw away for example a lengthy section around the middle of the book sees one of our many primary cha
2693,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,3,i like tigana i would have love this book if only dianora is braver or her brother had a happy ending or catriana did not end up with the most unlikely partner so many ifs that even if the fantasy was grand i could not give it a num knowing that these chinks in tigana s armor do not bother me at all because they do a lot the pace was slow at the start until i m halfway done see the patience i have of seeing tigana through and yet when the war began it coalesced then consumed my thin
2694,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,i don t even know what to say about this book it was so incredibly written i can t even begin to describe all the things i loved about it i remember reading something about three elements of a great book plot characters and prose if a book has at least num of the num it s a good book if it has all three it s a great book this one definitely focuses on characters and prose but has a good plot as well there are a lot of fantastic themes at play here memory complicated and ambiguous eth
2696,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,wow—tigana is the most underrated fantasy novel ever the power of emotions is what really carries this story the characters are painstakingly formed with every characteristic traceable to a specific moment in time and the emotional rawness of each character enables the reader to get really close to the characters and truly understand their thoughts and motivations they are also all wonderfully complex and flawed for the first time i found myself rooting for the villain to win ten pages la
2697,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,i read this book years ago and loved it i d always meant to read more ggk but shockingly never got around to it until very recently after tackling a song for arbonne good and the lions of al rassan amazing i decided to re read tigana and see if it held up to my memories to keep it brief yes the book did hold up and then some ggk is such a beautiful writer but i think it s the characters in tigana that put it head and shoulders above most fantasy you can t call these personalities
2698,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,what do you begin to say about the experience of reading a book that so deeply resonated with and changed you tigana is an absolute masterpiece and i have never read something that so filled me up with its beauty and colored my perceptions of life guy gavriel kay is a master of language his prose is purely lyrical but the loveliness of this work goes far deeper than that there is a magic to this story to the portrayal of characters to the world he creates that i have never before encou
2699,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,2,i listened to this book as part of a book club there were many people that almost gave up or gave up on this book the book starts very slowly so just be aware that it takes a few hours to get going and even after that there are many flat bits the author was the man that helped tolkien s son put together silmarillion so you get the idea on his style many compare him to grr martin which is pretty accurate but at least martin is enriching a world for a huge series the author spends a lot of
2700,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,3,after reading guy gavriel kay s excellent under heaven this book felt like a bit of a step backwards in my admiration for the author while under heaven seemed to effortlessly walk the tightrope between action and love and philosophizing about the paths that men and women take in their search for meaning in their lives this story seemed more forced and definitely more violent i almost put it down several times but was sucked in enough to have to read to the ending and i have to mention a s
2701,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,3,g g kay s is a bit of a piecemeal fantasy and i consider it a piecemeal success at the beginning too wordy and expository and later on rushed and fragmentary this is pretty clearly the stand alone work of a novelist who likely should have been working in a series and heaven knows there are plenty of the opposite in this world the intelligence of this novel is in the way its politics sneak up on you what seems at first a straightforward bit of robin hood esque derring do and revolution i
2702,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,this was my first ggk novel and overall i thought it was quite good it s basically the story of a nation divided by war ruled over by two sorcerers one of the sorcerers who despite being the bad guy was one of my favorite characters cast a spell many years ago that basically wipes out the memory of a particular province tigana for all but those who lived there and predictably a small band of survivors is now plotting and fighting to restore the memory of tigana and reclaim the plac
2703,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,the only thing that last after we are gone is our name memory of us in the world and it was robbed from the people of tigana their existence and past was only known to people born in tigana for everyone else tigana never existed and the ones who survived the terrible fate are left to reclaim what was theirs their name and the freedom to say it aloud to others but the book is not about that it’s about the people who had to face the truth make difficult choices and live with the conseq
2704,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,i liked this book every bit as well as i remembered it s as layered as an onion complex full of satisfying and memorable characters deployed in a world that s rich and believable the magic is well thought out there are plot twists in plenty as there should be when there s a dispossessed prince in a band of itinerant musicians there are brave and noble women with complicated lives beyond the well told story though what this book seems to me to be is an exploration of loyalty and honor an
2705,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,this book is the rarest of gems it s lauded as a classic and for once the reviews are spot on a sorcerer king declared war upon tigana and his son was slain in battle enraged and grieving for his son the king erased tigana from the world no one who wasn t born in tigana knew that the land ever existed they couldn t even understand the name if spoken aloud those native to tigana renamed lower corte became homeless in the truest sense of the word nineteen years later an odd assorment
2706,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,not much i can add to the wonderful reviews already written about tigana excellent world building and characters a story of love and loss tragedy and hope and a whole lot of blurred lines which is what made the characters so realistic kay has a way of writing compelling characters and complex plotting yet being easy to read comfortable there s a natural artistry to his work i m always complaining how there s not many standalone novels in sf/f well i got my wish an absorbing tale all on
2707,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,3,great characters good interesting storyline the power play and the political intrigue are well done the twists were not too predictable just one at the end was so out of the blue that i found it annoying and out of place intelligent fantasy for grown ups with the heroes and the bad guys not just in black and white but with a lot of grey shades in between some parts of the book had a lot of suspense and i could not put the book down unfortunately other parts bored me a lot and were rea
2708,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,3,this book didn t affect me as profoundly as it has many of those who read it i liked it well enough but i didn t fall into it or feel myself ripped to bits which to be frank is what i was expecting from a writer like kay but that s just me there s no doubt that kay s writing is intensely emotive and he can set a grand scene in tigana he paints the human condition broadly comprising life love and memory in broad sweeping strokes as well as with delicate tints using ivory brushes this
2709,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,3,i’ve been trying to read this book for like a month now… but every time i get to b n i realize that i left the post it on another jacket… or that i left the freaking note in the table in the kitchen in the bathroom… look i got problems remembering where i leave stuff so i decided to tattoo it to my left arm and just show it to mr greg or the paper when i get there and get over with it… but when i got there i had to deliver some scones to a briton… and since she the briton used to work
2710,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,i have no words that would do kay justice the man is a master of words mood manipulator a character building genius i have probably cried more tears for his books than all the other books i ever read combined if there is ever a safe way to erase a part of your memory i might go to get my kay memories erased so i can enjoy him again for the first time read his books thank me later croatian translations are superb btw normally i d always recommend reading in original language if that s an o

2712,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,this is probably the most beautiful book i have ever read

2717,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,so good standalone fantasy is hard to do right but ggk found a way here beautiful prose and worldbuilding a wide cast of characters with nuanced development and diverse backgrounds and motives i love the slow inevitable buildup of the plot towards the culmination of everything the characters were working towards like robin hobb ggk takes his time building up character relationships and story tension before unleashing major events and that creates a suspension and inevitability that i so
2718,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,num something fair warning this is a horrid review i m having a terrible time organizing my thoughts about tigana worse than usual so i apologize in advance this is even less of a review than usual and more of stream of consciousness when i first discovered ggk four or five years ago i read the lions of al rassan and absolutely loved it and it launched ggk onto my list of favorite authors where he has remained ever since i then gave tigana a shot i think i tried to read it in a couple
2719,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,“there are no wrong turnings only paths we had not known we were meant to walk ” this book has been on my radar for a while but i came across it recently and noticed a friend had read it so i decided to take the plunge and i am glad that i did characters num plot num num world building num num the strength of the book is in the characters the had depth and complexity there were very few one dimensional characters in this story even the protagonists were understandable in such a way that i believe
2720,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,it is indeed as kay says in the afterword these are ambitious elements for what was also meant to be a romantic adventure they intimidated me as they began to emerge even recording them now i find myself shaking my head but beneath them all lies the idea of using the fantasy genre in just this way letting the universality of fantasy—of once upon a time—allow escapist fiction to be more than just that to also bring us home i tried to imagine myself with a stiletto not a bludgeon slipping
2722,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,i read tigana by guy gavriel kay because it was the only fantasy novel on the book list for my english class that being said i am anything but disappointed with this book i liked a lot of things about this novel including but not limited to the messages the characters and the feelings it provoked within me the messages in this book are not always obvious they are things you need to think over and pull apart until you can figure out the true meaning one big message in the novel was the

2728,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,3,i was really interested in both the concept of the book and kay s world building but the writing style made it hard for me to connect to the story kay s writing including the dialogue feels very formal so i felt like i never heard the voice of any of the characters devin who is ostensibly the main character felt more like a blank slate than a real person he s the rookie through whom the reader is introduced to the world but he himself never feels like a fleshed out character kay s poe
2729,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,stuff i read tigana by guy gavriel kay review i read this book first when i was in high school and i think that out of all the books i read during that very formative period of my life tigana had the largest impact on me perhaps not even directly because there is so much more in this book this time than i remember getting out of it at the time but i was young then newer to reading and now i am more an old hand and this was the book i chose to be my numth review it has aged well it sur
2730,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,tigana is an epic fantasy story told within a single book it’s full of political maneuvering and schemes blind devotion to causes touching friendships and a bit of magic there was enough world building in this one book to sustain a longer series and i would have happily read more books featuring this world and these characters the characters were where tigana really shone for me several of them were very likeable and i thought the friendships between them were especially well written t
2731,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,5,i first read this book about a year ago but wasn t sure i could do it justice in a review simply put this is an amazing book tigana is the name of a lost country conquered in the prologue by a sorcerer determined to wipe out its culture and even its name and identity the story mostly follows a group of freedom fighters including the exiled prince who are determined to win their land back also crucial is a tiganese woman who infiltrates the sorcerer s harem planning to kill him but wind
2733,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,3,setting kay puts a lot of thought and detail into the world building and i feel he was successful in creating a sense of place and it making the setting transportive there wasn t anything particularly creative about what he did with the world though the magic system wasn t defined at all and everything was taken from your average medieval esque society plot the premise itself is interesting but so little happens over the course of the book small preparations for the big event here and th
2734,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,in a lot of ways the arc of this novel is the most traditional of any fantasy i ve read a rag tag group of adventurers go an adventure to take back their homeland from a tyrant alternating with a counterpoint narrative of unwilling member of the tyrant s harem and her complex feelings for him coming from the early nums the novel shows a lot of indication of the things that have fascinated readers of the genre since it shows the heroes doing very bad things and ultimately does a lot to com
2735,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,num stars tigiana is a pretty lovely book especially in its ideas it’s a story about language and memory and how people deal with the past and about how people do kind of awful things for pretty understandable reasons it’s also in typical guy gavriel kay fashion about a world that’s changing from what it had been before and how people learn to live with that there are a lot of things about this story that are wonderful but i think what really makes it work is the storyline surrounding dia
2736,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,2, this is one of those stories in which the very extremes of human emotion can tear the reader apart said the review on amazon com my own impression was something more along the lines of meh i d give this book maybe a num or a num on the richter scale you know the sort of earthquake that rattles the windows a bit and people who felt it have something to talk about for the next day or two i m from california originally the premise for the book is really a pretty cool curse while king brandin
2737,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,2,too long and drawn out just took ages to get anywhere in the end num of the way through i gave up i didn t really enjoy the characters either too thin 
2738,Tigana,Guy Gavriel Kay,4,i believe the best way to describe what was for me the essence of tigana is to quote a passage from the afterward of the book by the author guy gavriel kay “ there s a play called translations by brian friel it is basically an extended passionate debate between a village priest in ireland and the leader of an english survey team that has been traversing the countryside mapping it carefully and more importantly changing the names of places from gaelic to english both men are aware
2739,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2,originally reviewed at bookwraiths i read this novel when it was initially published in the mid nums it was a favorite of mine at the time and i have always recalled it fondly however after completing a re read it has become painfully obvious that the enjoyment i received from this book must have been one of those teenage fads because it has disappeared right along with my desire to keep solving a rubik’s cube the tour guide in jhereg is vlad taltos the world he guides us through is
2740,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,ehr mah gerd vlad taltos oh what’s that is that a badass name for a badass main character why yes yes it is look at that name look at it it fits him perfectly clear concise ominous you know your mc is a badass when he’s in the middle of an internal monologue and subtly lets slip that he’s been view spoiler [ killed and resurrected hide spoiler ] before and then just keeps on talking like it’s no big deal i was all “la la la this story is neato ” but then wait wut ” i had to
2741,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,immediate reaction this was a blast a little fantasy noir fun for anyone who likes bad men behaving with honour vlad taltos is an anti hero extraordinaire and all the minor characters and relationships he s surrounded with are equally cool later this is only the second book i ve read by steven brust and the first i ve read that he wrote alone i read his collaboration with emma bull freedom and necessity a couple of months ago and loved their book so much i knew i had to hunt down their
2742,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,the recent release of iorich sent me down the path of re reading the taltos series while iorich was enjoyable and engrossing memories sent me back to the inaugural vlad sophisticated writing interesting characters and one seriously convoluted plot it s interesting because this is the fourth book in the timeline of the series and vlad s history but actually the first published echoes of lucas i d recommend reading jhereg first as it s told in a largely linear fashion with only a few fl
2743,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,satisfyingly good the kind of good that makes you anxious to get to the next book the kind of good that makes you glad there are over ten books in the series the kind of good that makes me not care about book orders maybe it s a good thing these books are written out of order is a thing i never thought i d say but i have a good feeling about steven brust and i trust he ll deliver it s been awhile since high fantasy has been this good for me and it s been even longer since i liked a pov
2744,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,while there was nothing absolutely mind blowing about the plot or the fantasy the one thing that really stood out in this book was the fantastic writing it was absolutely some of the easiest reading i ve had for an obviously detailed and fleshed out world full of lots of magic interesting races very long lived people and dragons it flew by so quickly and easily i was rather surprised at how much info dump never came across as info dump i learned so much about the world naturally that i
2745,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,num num stars the vlad taltos series is one thst i strongly recommend to anyone who likes good fantasy i would classify it as noir fantasy with a good sense of humor great world building great characters and well written tight plots that do not drag and are never boring as good as all that is it is the main character of vlad taltos assassin witch and rogue and his jhereg familiar that make the series so special highly recommended 
2746,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,reread febnum review added i originally gave this num stars although i ve read it numerous times really enjoyed it i just never thought it had any redeeming features beyond sheer enjoyment now that i ve read most of the rest of the series i see on a re read that the craftsmanship of this story demands another star this is not the first book in the chronology of the series but it is the first published why should you read it first because the author couldn t have picked a better wa
2747,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,re read num/num/num as audiobook the year i was thirteen i read and re read obsessively the same perhaps thirty books keep in mind i had almost nothing but free time and i read three to four books a day that is a lot of times to re read anything i ve since learned that this is not an uncommon phenomenon among children and young teens and it does not indicate any problems with their overall reading habit for me it was a matter of falling into comfortable grooves revisiting powerful experi
2748,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,i refuse to look at what i said about this book the last time i read it for fear of influencing what i have to say this time around but i will certainly do so once i have posted my thoughts my thoughts total bafflement that my second time through jhereg was like the first time through the only two things i remembered about the story were vlad taltos our first person narrating criminal mastermind/assassin and his lockheed like dragon loiosh other than that i didn t remember a thing it was
2749,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,num stars this was a really good beginning to the first book in the vlad taltos series this was my first time reading a steven brust novel even though he has been in my queue for as long as i can remember this is a novel that was first published nearly num years ago it is written in a fashion that keeps it fresh and relative to todays fantasy scene the combination of magic sorcery and witchcraft is very unique the book gives some creative back story that explains the difference between the two s
2750,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,this was a delightful beginning to a series that i am sure to be addicted to very soon in fact i ve already jumped into the second volume but on this jhereg is a first person narrative of an assassin and a particular job he undertook a huge amount of money offered showed that if something seemed too good to be true it probably was mischief and mayhem ensue what i thought of as a combination of a crime caper and an epic fantasy turned out to be a quickly paced and often humorous adventure 
2751,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,this is the third in my list of books that inspired me to start writing fantasy and in many ways is the most influential the hero of the series vlad taltos is an assassin which is you know not an especially nice thing to be the thing is deep down vlad really wants to be a nice guy he just needs to kill a few shitbags first now it s true that the list of people vlad needs to kill includes pretty much the entire dragaeran empire but he s willing to leave a few off the list if they chang
2752,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,this is a very well written book with nice action and magic a sort of cheeky modern story in a fantasy world it s just not my particular cup of tea

2756,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,an old school type fantasy that i enjoyed but it didn t convince me that i need to read any more of the series 
2757,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,guess this is what you d call an oldie but a goodie i can t believe i hadn t heard of steven brust until a few weeks ago but he was recommended to me by a gaming friend of mine and then another good friend jumped into the twitter conversation to second the recommendation so that s two shoutouts from a couple of people whose opinions i highly value and that s when i knew i had to get my hands on this book posthaste jhereg is the beginning of a whole bunch of books set in brust s dragaera w
2758,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,i ve had this and i believe num of the novels that follow it on my shelves waiting to be read for years i think i picked them up after i read phoenix guard but whatever prompted me to buy them they like dracula when he s staked but still a whole skeleton in his coffin they were there condemned to endless waiting happily this one was selected as the subject of a group read here on goodreads and i had a reason excuse to move it ahead of the huge pile of library books that are always
2759,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,when i got this book it sat on my shelf for quite a while i knew nothing about the book and just by the title and description it sounded kinda lame i finally picked it up because it s a short one and i had just finished a massive book and needed something a little lighter so with that preamble i can t tell you how surprised i was at how good this one is it s fun as hell to read and the characters are really great everything about this book is splendid it almost reads like a detective
2760,Jhereg,Steven Brust,1,i often make jokes in these reviews that i enjoy nothing books books where nothing happens slow paced books introspective books books with a slow build reading jhereg i have come to learn that things to happen in those books interesting things things that move the story forward jhereg is a book where nothing happens and is incredibly dull about the whole thing damn near every scene in this book features the main character slowly and bored soundingly narrating it was an audio version
2761,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,jhereg is the tale of vlad taltos an assassin who is a foreigner to his area but has moved himself up in the organization of the jhereg along with his companions and his familiar loiosh a poisonous flying creature that he communicates with telepathically vlad is a sorcerer as well capable of using his discouraged foreign magics to his power he is approached by a daemon who informs him of a board member of the controlling caste that took off with their entire fortune and offers him an a
2762,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,steven brust s first entry in his vlad taltos is an entertaining fantasy tale of assassination i was first made aware of this series when i read what makes this book so great by jo walton i didn t actually read the chapters on this series but her introduction to them was enough to pique my interest brust almost introduces too much into the world in this first book there s a long history that is teased in this novel but seems to have far reaching effects there are num great houses of the empi
2763,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,picked this one up on a whim turned out totally into it from start to finish witch that is a mafia don check adorable and snarky little dragon familiar check very intricate world building that you don t even notice because it s done so well check old school fantasy fluff check would have been totally satisfied if this one a standalone very happy that it isn t 
2764,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,ages ago i read jo walton’s reviews of the vlad taltos books and resolved to read them immediately i did pick up this first book but after that failed to carry on even though the first book is good and jo’s reviews fascinating there’s a lot going on in this world and i really want to read more of the books to get a better grasp on it in the meantime vlad taltos himself is snarky moderately capable and definitely capable of getting himself into trouble a winning combination – even with
2765,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,brust does such a good job making these slim novels engaging and multifaceted fun capers interesting character development and relationships foreshadowing meditations on free will and morality jhereg while not the best in the series is a very good book there s a reason why this is the fourth or fifth time i ve read it 
2766,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,jhereg is a fantasy with a sort of reverse murder mystery twist where the protagonist s dilemma is not whodunnit but how do i do it vlad taltos is a skilled assassin but his latest target is a little tricky to tackle and a little hard to find but luckily vlad has a small cadre of friends of varied talents to call upon including his assassin wife and his psychically bonded pet jhereg a sort of miniature dragon vlad is also living proof that not all assassin characters have to be dar
2767,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,this was a fun read a mystery/caper fantasy story about an assassin who accepts a challenging job that turns out to be even more dangerous and consequential than he expects i enjoyed the lighthearted tone of the narrative and i liked vlad s first person account he s a little incongruous as an assassin who goes weak at the knees at the thought of being targeted himself even though death is not often permanent in this universe i liked the magical system pretty well and there is a lot of magic
2768,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,this book took me a while to get around to but was well worth the ride it covers a rather grim society of dragerans more like particularly evil seven foot elves and humans beneath notice neither of which seem to view death as much more than an inconvenience one of the key elements of the story is that death is not permanent provided you can pay to be revived their society is based around twelve noble houses one of which is house jhereg the jhereg do work for the right price everyth
2769,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,i was pretty sure i was going to like this since some people whose taste i trust have mentioned it to me before the whole series features in jo walton s series of posts on tor com/in her collection of those posts in book form and was one of the ones from the list i made while reading it that i have underlined several times as a priority still i wasn t sure enough so i only ordered the first omnibus which contains the first three books ten chapters in i ordered the rest unfortunately 
2770,Jhereg,Steven Brust,1,a coworker gave this title a glowing review and lent it to me shortly after this a friend saw it on my desk and commented about it s brilliance you ll really like it he was glowing with excitement i can t wait till you re done so we can talk about it together unfortunately this book frustrated me with it s gross attempt to be cooler than the reader the narrator is one of the more obvious gary sues that i ve ever seen but the story was interesting enough during the preface to keep me r
2771,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,this book was a pleasant surprise friends had read and loved it which is why i picked it up but i d read the incrementalists first and though i loved the concept i didn t like the execution this book i loved i m a sucker for tales of assassins so it had me there assassins with personality bonus points a mystery to be solved i m hooked add in humour and complexity of both character and plot and i couldn t put this down a note on the narration it was odd bernard setaro clark has a
2772,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2,ever play d d with the kid who wants to be the half elf wizard/assassin/ranger because he loves everything and can t decide that s what this unfocused fantasy landscape reminds me of the author and i don t share the same sensibilities as to what makes for a good fantasy world i m not sure when it started but view spoiler [ dragon eggs and psychic familiars have become cliche to me hide spoiler ] had i read this as a young person i might have liked it 
2775,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,a very fun book easy to read and did not feel at all dated for having been written over num years ago feels very much like a mix of the riyria chronicles and the dresden files set in a mafia like setting bought most of the series before i d even finished it looking forward to reading more 
2776,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,this is such a hard book to talk about cory and kathie will know exactly what i mean but usually when you talk about books you discuss the setting especially in fantasy the characters the plot with all of the vlad taltos books though you open your mouth to say something and you find that you have to stop two reasons num the world building in these books is so intricate and detailed that it s insane it s also done so very subtly that you never feel like you re in the midst of an info du
2777,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,easy read but nothing gripping here 
2778,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,so you know how it is when a friend recommends you a book and you get it and then they’re all like “well do you love it do you love it ” and maybe you ve not started reading yet so a thin haze of panic settles over you what if you hate it what do you say then so when i received this book as a birthday gift from a very good friend of mine i was excited at first and then i was all like “oh shoot what if i absolutely hate this book ” i need not have worried because i freakin’ loved thi
2779,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,num num my final vote for this one honestly i almost gave up half way through i was lost like a babe in the woods wasn t sure i was reading the first one in the series cause maybe there was at least a prequel nooo checked num times hmph yes book one all those houses names history and allusions on past events felt like recaps for someone who read the previous books in a series thankfully the main characters were cool and fun enough to bring me till the end of the book there was
2780,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,an assassin is offerred a job that sounds to good to refuse but soon finds himself in an impossible situation can vladimir find a way out that doesn t besmirch his friend s honour or lead to an all out war between three factions of the empire unfortunately he doesn t have much time a matter of days before all hell breaks loose a light easy read in an interesting world a simple narrative structure that that sets up the framework of the impossible situation and then we see how it might be
2781,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2,i have heard a lot of hype about this novel it is allegedly quick with both sword and wit and the protagonist is supposed to be archly sophisticated and wryly humorous as well as selflessly heroic i found myself disappointed there were maybe two whole lines that made me laugh out loud and on the whole the humor was forced and flat unless you like repeatedly reading shut up loiosh the setting was vague and although society seems intriguingly complicated so much of its structure i
2782,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,no spoiler this is a series i came across years ago and never picked up to read since i have been reading several first series books of late i thought it was time this book is a first person narrative with vlad taltos an assassin criminal type guiding us through a world of organizations or houses jhereg is the name of the house he belongs to the story essentially takes us through a assassination commission he receives from a very powerful ruler in his house and the efforts that vlad must
2783,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,reminded me of scott lynch s gentleman bastards books which of course this pre dates but i read those first but maybe the better point of comparison is lois mcmaster bujold s miles vorkosigan books so yeah lovable rogue in a fantasy setting and though there s sorcery and witchcraft and dragons or more accurately jheregs who are like mini dragons or something this is fundamentally a caper novel which is a thing that i love our hero is really good at his job assassin but he f
2784,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,assassin nonsense in a fantasy land where death is generally not final and humans are the minority yeah i know everyone loves these books but did you love the first one because i thought this was inoffensive but also uninteresting and there was this overbaked convolution to the whole thing that made me think i ought to be reading it out of the super sekrit writing notebooks of a high school kid who plays a lot of d d not like there’s anything wrong with d d just you know random r
2785,Jhereg,Steven Brust,1,this book has first book itis bad pacing bad dialogue bad outtakes a shift from third person to third person omniscient with abandon it had sort of an interesting idea about this high level mobster/baron messing with more high level people and pulling off a heist to kill a guy who couldn t be killed it has a nice fight in the end but it spends almost num pages trying to figure out what it wants to be when it grows up the book is mostly behold my world is it not worldly but in the end 
2786,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,a nice fun quick fantasy tale with lots of action and magic throughout the story i like the world building and the characters introduced in this tale and hope to read more of this author num stars for a fun read 
2787,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,my cousin introduced me to this book like when i was num i m way way more than twelve now i remember reading the first chapter or maybe two when i spent a night at his house i never did get any further than that recently i was reminded of the book and so picked it up i m only kind of glad i did i kind of like vlad but he seems shallow to me just acting instead of feeling i only kind of like his buddy uh what s his name for the same reason he has one defining characteristic he c
2789,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,i wasn t sure what to expect on this time through it s been num num years since i read this for the first time and there have been plenty of old favorites that haven t held up to a reread i m happy to report that i had a lot of fun with this book there is a lot of information and world building that has to be given to the reader but the author does a nice job of folding that into enough action that it doesn t bog down the story the characters and humor are as good as i remember and the writi
2790,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,lots of reviews of this on the site already the first of the popular vlad taltos series by steven brust for mw it falls into the same category as the garrett books of glen cook – a modern feeling take on fantasy with the subject being a hitman rather than a pi a pleasant easy read with a nice puzzle base set in a well envisaged world not rushing to read more but i probably will as time presents itself 
2792,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,the first of the vlad taltos novels jhereg by steven brust has been on my “to read” list for the better part of a decade and a half back in august audible com released jhereg and just about all the other vlad taltos novels via their increasingly impressive audible frontiers label jhereg introduces the readers to the assassin vlad taltos living in amongst a race of tall long lived sorcerers called dragaerans vlad has risen to a station of respect and power if of a limited variety despi
2793,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,highly entertaining and also unlike nums book just enough details to get the story moving interesting world building too i like how different creatures are given unique names the writing is intelligent and very engaging the dialogues are also good the narrator is also nice highly recommend audiobook to anyone planning to continue the series through next year 
2795,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,a mystery/police procedural disguised as a fantasy novel nicely plotted and extremely readable fun and fast paced brust never slows down to cram in some fantastical element magic and dragons and the like are carefully woven in such that we get a glimpse of the larger world as the circumstances of the crime are unraveled lots of books in this series and lots more by steven brust this was his debut i ll likely read more 
2796,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,a good book to dip into for a few hours it s engaging and fun centered around an interesting main character 
2799,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,i thoroughly enjoyed this book the writing was smooth as butter and vlad was well worth the price of admission he s not the toughest or strongest or best fighter but he can out think his opponents and that makes him supremely interesting not to mention he s pretty damn likeable
2800,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,definitely not what i was expecting especially from high fantasy but in the best way excellent comedic timing interactions between characters and world building also such a clever plot and i loved the way the mechanics of the world were revealed very slowly but not so slow that i found myself confused past the point of understanding what going on i cannot wait to start the next book 
2801,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,this is the first written vlad taltos book and the fourth in the current internal chronological order after reading the previous ones i have to admit that this is the one to start the series with it’s full of background information which isn’t told either extensively or at all about vlad his job and family the world the great weapons and everything the book is short quick to read fast paced and full of plot twists and witty banter vlad owns his own small sector of the city of adrilankh
2802,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,steven brust s jhereg is the first in a long series of books focuses on the adventures of vlad taltos a witty amiable and ruthless assassin belonging to the house of jhereg he is accompanied by his familiar loiosh and his shamed dragon assistant kragar among a host of other characters in this truly epic cast the central plot of this book is that vlad must find a way to kill a man who has stolen from the house of jhereg without betraying his employer s oath that the man will not be har
2804,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,i ve always been a fan of the anti hero type character and i do believe that vlad taltos may just be a new favorite born a lowly human in a world ruled by long lived elves dragaerans vlad becomes a sort of low level crimelord for his family the jhereg who are just one of seventeen great houses he is an exemplary hired killer a minor sorcerer and a witch it is through his witchcraft that he gains his wisecracking telepathic familiar loiosh a small winged dragonlike lizard called a jhere
2805,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,cynical assassin is a pretty well worn fantasy trope at this point and the dragaerans are pretty much reskinned elves but gritty yet burst manages to breathe some new life into old stereotypes for a clever witty romp a lot of the appeal is voice vlad is every bit the too clever and arrogant for his own good antihero we ve gotten used to in urban fantasy but that doesn t mean the trope doesn t continue to be fun and vlad is an unusually funny version even when things get a little dark th
2806,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2,i decided to read this book because i love assassins and dragons and this has both i liked the world for the most part but the writing style was what really killed it for me first the world was interesting and different there was a lot of everything which was kind of annoying assassins and emperors and dragons and reincarnation and great weapons and soul eating weapons and witchcraft and sorcery and and and it s okay when there are a few specialties to make the world interesting b
2807,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,my reading was starting to slow down and i realized that the stuff i was reading was too downer and artsy i needed a good rollickin adventure for a change terran has recommended the vlad taltos series repeatedly as fun fantasy adventure from his youth we own that series and it is not in boxes waiting for us to finish building bookcases so i decided to give it a try the first book while it reads like a rookie effort in some ways really is brilliant vlad is a great narrator with a great
2808,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,oh my gosh this book was so refreshing why you ask num vlad is already married no romance crap blocking out the action and intrigue num vlad is happily married omg he doesn t flirt with everything with boobs and a face he clearly loves his wife num lots of strong female characters doing things to help move the plot/action forward they are necessary to resolve the conflict they do this without flirting with or being flirted with by vlad num no super long backstory descriptions we re given re
2809,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,millions of things have been said about this book i won t try to write a useful review this is mostly for my own memory i reread this book recently and while i remembered vaguely the overall plot and that i thoroughly enjoyed it i was again blown away by a few moments moments that i should not have forgotten perhaps it s because i loved teckla so much more that this one kind of faded to just a pleasant but indistinct memory but there s so damn much that s good about this vlad s cha
2810,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,this book begins the series about the adventures of vlad the assassin the series is wildly uneven with a few really weak entries but the best novels in the group are some of the most original fantasy out there the best of the series are fast funny irreverent and wildly creative the books take place on another world where humans co exist with draegarans a race of tall aggressive and extremely long lived humanoids basically elves but not like you ve ever seen them before the world
2811,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2,meh i really hope this series gets better but this first book in the series really didn t do it for me i found the characters one dimensional at best and the plot not all that gripping then there was the writing style lady teldra was tall beautiful and graceful as a dzur her eyes were as soft as an iorich s wing well that doesn t really tell me how graceful she was or how soft her eyes were given that i don t have the foggiest clue what a dzur or an iorich is all in all the ne
2812,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,one of my favorite fantasy series and writers of all time he jumps back forth in the heroes timeline between books just to keep you wanting a little longer to find out what happens next oh fine but it works it s fun to drop in on a fully developed character in this book and tag along on his assassin witch with a wise cracking tiny dragon familiar who is the actual main character imo adventure now if i only knew the correct way to say his name loy oash lo e osh l o e o sh forget it 
2813,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,second time reading this novel a quick read due to the first person narration of vlad taltos a light hearted book that grabbed by taking a number of fantasy tropes enchanted swords animal familiars sorcery etc and using them in a detective/mystery type of story i could remember key things from years ago such as how taltos meets loiosh the early scene at the restaurant but not how they finally nail the bad guy at the end good stuff and i am moving onto the second novel 
2814,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,folks there are reasons i own every book brust has written in the spirit of fritz leiber s fafhrd and the gray mouser a solid swords n sorcery backdrop but essentially the tale of good guy as screwed up and conflicted as the rest of us trying to get by in a rough and weird town lot of andre dumas raymond chandler / dashiell hammett sprinkled around maybe a hint of rex stout 
2815,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,a fun read i now understand all the hype i ve been hearing about steven brust and i almost forgive him the error in judgment that is the phoenix guards 
2816,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,i had hard time reading and finishing this book it was refering to many people and places and specifics of the world that i wasn t familiar with also jhereg is a place but jhereg is a race and an animal i am just generally confused by this maybe i should have read some other book from this world first 
2817,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,this was the first time i d read any books by steven brust and i quite enjoyed it i feel as if i ve gotten just a taste of a complex world and yet i learned what was needed for this plot i certainly want to know more however the setting up of a complex job while avoiding huge pitfalls was enjoyable and i liked the wry humorous tone 
2818,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,just as good this time as the last time i read it so long ago although this was the first of the series to be written it definitely paid off to have read in chronological order first this time around sure there are a few inconsistencies between this and the later books but it was still better than bouncing around in time 
2819,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,read in the early to mid nums re read this year good solid noir science fantasy pulp set in a world so far in the future it s more like the far distant past satirized in this penny arcade comic http //www penny arcade com/comic/num 
2820,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,is it just me or are all the wizards/sorcerers/man witches getting upset stomachs all the time it that a thing maybe it s a plot device so that they can fail without being incompetent or almost fail so that the story is more exciting 
2821,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2,i picked this up because of the high star rating on goodreads but in this case the masses are mistaken jhereg is a badly written book with linear low stakes plotting and paper characters whose sense of humor perpetually falls flat 
2822,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,really enjoyed this one a quick fun entertaining short fantasy/detective story with great action and humor it didn t scream this is a book written in the nums like some books from that time period do i guess there isn t much to say except i liked it and will read more of this series 
2823,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,meh flat characters an entirely forgettable story pretty much non existent worldbuilding the book was fun and i appreciated the lighthearted tone so it s not a total bust but i will not be continuing this series 
2824,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,sardonic energetic characterful 
2825,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,pretty good overall nice pacing and stuff 
2826,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,wow what a fun little book wish i d read this a long time ago i ve a feeling i m going to devour this series this is exactly my kind of fantasy perfect reading 
2827,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,a pleasure to read 
2828,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,awesome book among the greatest stories i ve ever had the pleasure of reading 
2829,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,little lacking by today s standards but still very good for its time amazing http //www staffersbookreview com/num 
2830,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2,i kept waiting for this book to get interesting or compelling and it never ever did 
2831,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,a fascinating fantasy noir/adventure romp through a world of assassins wizards and mob bosses 
2833,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,fantastic book i can t believe it isn t more popular 
2834,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2,the story was fine it just was not my cup of tea 
2835,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,the writing style of this book is extremely dialogue heavy and efficient with description the fun of reading jhereg is not due to flowery descriptions the fun of reading jhereg is in the character interaction and the world building when vlad the main character enters a room you know what he thinks about that room and a bit of what makes the room special or what plot elements are in it it is the other characters in this book that get the most attention not the scenery almost everything th
2836,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2,book is in the first person perspective of the young man vlad taltos a human in this fantasy land with dragons and various clans of humanoid races sort of like the tolkien elves yeah so far not of to a good start as i m not the biggest fan of first person perspective in books as it limits the story telling and the premis of the book is the exact same of all other standard fantasy novels i e a young white dark haired male humanoid\human with extreme skills or powers seen it a thousand times
2837,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,vlad taltos is a human on a world dominated by dragaerans human in appearance dragaerans are different from humans in a few ways most notably dragaerans are much taller and live for centuries rather than decades while there s a fair amount of prejudice towards members of different dragaeran houses most are united in their disdain for humans and yet vlad has managed to thrive there s a good deal of criminal activity in the jhereg and when you need someone taken out he s one of the bes
2838,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,i m a bit of an idiot for some reason the weird name in the titled weirdly spelled plus the series name plus some one sentence descriptions i must have picked up at some point in time i had always believed this series to be science fiction about a planet of psychic vampires i was sure of it the same way that despite not having read say crumpets with a spot of death a margie doobs mystery i would be sure that it would be a cozy mystery with characters who eat dessert and own cats 
2839,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2,i really wanted to like this i d heard a lot of good things recently and it sounded right up my alley i was very intrigued by the fantasy noir setting i just don t think it worked for me but it showed a lot of promise straight away i was hooked by the prologue i liked the feel of the world and the ceremony needed for vlad to get the egg which would eventually be loiosh faithful familiar but the austere promise of that scene was let down immensely by practically everything else for one l
2840,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,i wish i could rate this a num as it is the start of my favorite series and it holds a special place in my memory as i read it when i was really young however after reading this a lot of times i can see some of the flaws this novel has as many first novels in a long running series are at times the exposition is a bit out of nowhere and unprompted there are other times the humor is just crass and flashbacks can seem crammed in but for all of this the story is clever and was really ahead of its
2841,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,i wanted to rate this higher since it really was an enjoyable read however it lacked a few things that would have made it five star overall it was an entertaining quick read that was easy to follow with characters you could easily learn and had unique personalities i really enjoyed the perspective of vlad s experience as an assassin and how despite it being his profession he got nervous or suffered side effects that said however there wasn t a lot about this story that was original the
2842,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2,when reading fantasy one expects the author to have some good imagination jhereg has little fantasy and little imagination i gave the author over num pages chance to present this world to me and it didn t happen a good example of this lack of imagination are the domestic scenes where you see husband and wife dining together it s just a present day middle class home no attempt to imagine what impact this world with elves and dragons and pseudo deaths actually have on people the author ju
2843,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,this appears to be the first book in the series yet it takes place later in vlad s life so there s quite a bit of back story that i know little about this wasn t a huge problem because the writer sprinkled enough information without resorting to info dumps to make the story easy to follow the plot turned out to be fairly complicated vlad is hired to do a job within a short time limit the job has several complicating factors including one that could alienate a good friend the final plan
2844,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,this was quite an enjoyable read it starts out like fairly standard num s fantasy but after the first chapter everything changes it s actually more of a hitman/crime novel but it has a surprising amount of worldbuilding for a short book it s also very progressive for the num s with well balanced female characters and a main character that s not afraid to rely on others one minor point i really enjoyed at first i thought the concept of instant telepathy with anyone the characters know was
2845,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,a fun fantasy story from a huge series set in brust s world of houses connected to creatures real and fantastic dragaera while this isn t the first book he wrote for the series it is the first in the reprinted collections the book of jhereg being the first and a good place to start with his somewhat cynical assassin vlad taltos and vlad s sarcastic familiar the jhereg loiosh these aren t epic fantasies each is less than num pages but that doesn t mean brust doesn t throw a bit of phi
2846,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,i was talking about sf books with an acquaintance of mine he mentioned this author as a favorite and when i mentioned i hadn t read any and asked where to start this is what he suggested someone who actually reads sf was exciting enough that i put the book on home actually he suggested a three volume book but man one was about enough it was fine but i didn t like the main character and didn t really care about his struggles and man the book never convinced me to care despite
2847,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,num stars recommended for anyone who likes this type of book i never read this series when it was first published but stumbled upon it through several lists of top fantasy series after reading jhereg the first in the series i am a fan the main character vlad is bad ass but still has a conscience and his sarcasm and humor is quite fun the story moved along briskly with an enjoyable sense of mystery as well as political intrigue the other characters included a great mixture of different
2848,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,i like the characters the story was exciting but forgive me for saying brust is a lazy writer when recapping a conversation to another character don’t just write something like “i told her what was said ” that doesn’t happen in real life you don’t have to repeat the entire conversation but you might consider going over the pertinent details so my standard for “a good book” has been to ask if i am going to read the next book i don’t think i am just yet i think i’m going to spend some m
2850,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,vlad the witch with the smartass familiar vlad the crime boss vlad the assassin vlad the friend to dragaerans a tall imposing basically immortal race vlad is the minority in so many ways this is a quick read and a fun one brust introduces us to complex world and hints at other stories from the outset whetting our appetites for more the story works because it s constrained vlad systematically solves his problems to have others thrown in his path the scale grows until the finale wh
2852,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,while this novel is just a small introduction type story the world promises to be complex and filled with chaos there promises to be lots of history to explore houses to destroy in furture novels in this the first book in the series of which i plan to read more we meet vlad taltos an assassin he s put in a position where he has to use his brain as much probably more than his steel the plot is intriguing the characters are enjoyable and looking forward to reading more of the series 
2853,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,i guess i need to just accept the fact that i m a fantasy reader i ve resisted that label for a long time but obviously i must get something out of it or else i wouldn t keep tackling them and yet this one kinda falls outside of that genre so maybe i only like fantasy books that have other genres mixed in for instance like this one a caper novel there s lots of interesting ideas in here and i think that i m going to start adding in some other books from the series to my list to read
2854,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,a high fantasy darkly humorous classic about a society of sorcerous and political houses that often plot against one another i remember thinking how super unique it felt when i read it as a kid and it still holds up be wary though that you re dealing with characters that can use telepathy teleport and even resurrect each other is some cases but i only found one of the instances of genetic magic to be tacky plot armor would recommend to fans of the elric saga or salvatore s dark elf trilo
2855,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,it s been a while since i read a good sturdy traditional fantasy and this was quite an enjoyable foray back into that forest by traditional i don t mean that it s boring or cliche just structured in a particular familiar sort of way but with enough quirks and unique concepts to make it interesting coupled with an engaging and likable narrator this was quite a fun ride excited to read more of this series 
2856,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2,sci fi in a world where everything and anything is possible well written and the author keeps things moving along but because the world has no physical laws there are no boundaries on what is possible characters use magic and sorcery and can be reanimated if killed as a result pretty much every plot revolves around a type of deus ex machina employing a supernatural power that was previously unknown to the reader no desire to continue in the series 
2857,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,i really really enjoy steven brust he has good women characters and his fantasy world seems to have generally nailed gender equality also they re really fun books overall and this was no different my favorites are the pedantically narrated ones the phoenix guards num years after because the historian is hilariously defensive and i enjoy that but so far i m really enjoying the vlad taltos ones too on to the next 
2858,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2, dug review out of the depths of livejournal this was not a quick read despite its num pages it took me a while to get into the book and even after i felt like i had there were still some off putting things work always always being in quotation marks when it was never necessary in the first place for one it s ok stock fantasy with the assassin element giving it some slightly better than normal edge but i don t think i ll read any more after the other two in the same volume 
2859,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,thoroughly enjoyed this short but excellent book vlad is a fun character that reminds me a bit of harry dresden but is different enough to keep me interested unlike other dresden clones i also really like the worldbuilding and that fact that brust doesn t spoonfeed the reader some of the world feels weird and it s supposed to you figure things out with time this book was super fun and short enough that i may try to knock out a few more before the end of the year recommended for fans o
2860,Jhereg,Steven Brust,1,after a very promising first chapter this book is simply bores you to death standing in a room and talking then standing in an other room and talking then sitting in an other room and talking confusing and boring it takes likes num pages until the writer cares to explain how does the draegarans look like however they are there since the first pages 
2861,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,this was a listen of an old favorite and was a treat performed by bernard setaro clark who does a wonderful job telling the story and providing different voices for the main characters i look forward to revisiting the rest of the series on audio which by the way helps me with the oft hungarian pronunciations 
2862,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,pretty solid read not what i d consider a standout title as some of what i ve read recently i like vlad s character but the world which the story inhabits is a bit well trodden and a bit boring for my tastes the pov is a little narrow but i m not discounting it for other readers i give jhereg a num num/num
2864,Jhereg,Steven Brust,1,initial reaction mary sue rides again two chapters in holy shit mary sue isn t even riding this time her foot s just stuck in the stirrup and she s getting dragged through a swamp of horrible writing 
2865,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,this book is like a cold coca cola during lunch on a random thursday a treat without much substance it passes the time for sure but when death has no stakes and every character such that they are differentiated is a super being you tend not to care what happens 
2866,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,i found this book to be really intriguing i particularly liked the main character s narration which made me feel as if i knew him quite early on in the book and so i found myself invested in the action i listened to the audible version and the presentation was very good 
2868,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,fast pace crime syndicate thriller in very interesting fantasy world in some episodes i would even say that story was too short and i would have liked to know more details about the universe setup and background of characters i hope all my questions get answered in next volumes in series 
2869,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,one of my husband s favorite series with some wonderfully interesting characters i suspect i would like to read this more than listen to the audio as it is quite action filled the voice artist was excellent i really enjoyed his voices 
2870,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,a very fun delightful and quick read i was going to knock it down to four stars for the what i felt clumsy introduction to the main character s wife but the sarcasm laughter and humanness throughout more than makes up for it enjoyable read for sure 
2871,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,a high fantasy harry dresden or a mafia corwin of amber the jhereg series is a deep fantasy world with a wise cracking assassin as the main lead if you like jim butcher douglas adams roger zelazny robert aspirin patricia briggs give steven brust a go 
2872,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,has potential you ve got to take the early stuff for what it is i reckon practice interesting character fast paced very sparse on setting hence num stars because i couldn t picture the place or society clearly anyway on to the next 
2873,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,this book is a highly entertaining fantasy novel about an assassin who takes a job and comes to realize that much more going on than he originally realized brust s writing style is so immersive that it makes this book nearly impossible to put down this book is so much fun to read and is addictively entertaining i actually liked the way you are just thrust into vlad s life with hardly any explanation you slowly get to know him his friends and his organization while he is trying to complete a
2874,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,light fun hook skips forward in time a fair bit but also fills in details on the world it describes recommended
2876,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,i’ve judged this book by the cover and passed it dozens of times when it was recommended i read it more dutiful than hopeful but it was really great fantasy and noir a lot of fun 
2877,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,really more of a num num it kept me intrigued and interested and i plan to keep reading in the series although perhaps not right away the narration was very good and the world brust creates is kind of fascinating i also like that he s pretty skilled at providing the background info needed in small chunks as needed rather than clumsy long history lessons definitely wanting to learn more about vlad taltos and his past note i haven t been keeping track of this in my reviews but this is one of t
2878,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,an assassin takes on a difficult job in a setting where all of the characters are so op that no one is and amusingly people tend to come back from the dead unless you go significantly out of the way to prevent this from happening the tone goes all in on cleverness which may appeal to some people but left me feeling sort of empty there’s not much emotion to be found and despite having first person pov the narration comes across as rather detached 
2879,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,honestly i love the absolute crap out of this series brust has such a great voice on the page and the characters are just fantastic this is one of the best ones in the series too 
2880,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,numrd time reading jhereg still love it 
2881,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,always great mafia story meets fantasy world 
2882,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,it s ocean s num but instead of a casino it s a medieval fantasy city full of humans and part dragons also instead of a heist it s an assassination wit abounds 
2883,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,a fun read detective/assassin novel set in a fantasy world with a pet dragon that communicates via telepathy dial me in 
2884,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,great opening to an epic that had me trying to stay one step ahead of vlad and failing throughout the novel looking forward to the next num 
2885,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,a few places seemed a bit jumpy and rushed but overall it was an enjoyable book and i liked the characters i ll definitely be continuing 
2886,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,hired assassin with a jhereg on his shoulder outwits the target with the help of some friends 
2887,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,a compelling take in a rich world reading about an assassin who s main strength is his network of friends and contacts was a treat will probably spend the next year reading the rest of the series 
2888,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,great fun reminds me of the days when you could read a while book in a week and actually wanted to

2890,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,good stuff fantasy classic
2891,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,one of the small pleasures in life is enjoying a book and knowing that it is the first in a long series jhereg didn t change my life but it provided a few fun evenings 
2892,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,vlad taltos is a human assassin working for the house of jhereg near the start of the book he receives a very difficult and unusual contract for a former member of the jhereg council who ran off with nine million of the house’s funds what follows is a twisty puzzle set in a strange and sometimes confusing world overall i enjoyed jhereg but i had real trouble getting into it for one thing i wasn’t expecting the sort of story i got the cover and blurb make it out to be what i think of as “
2893,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,a solid start to this series you ve got magical assassins political machinations strange beasts and engaging characters some of the prose is a little awkward but this was a worthwhile read 
2894,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2,jhereg is the first book in a well loved fantasy series that started in the nums though honestly the book itself felt pretty contemporary i kind of want to call it ya but overall i think the book may be a bit too dry for that jhereg takes place in a loosely urban setting on a planet called dragaera which is mostly inhabited by sorceress called dragaerans beings that can live for thousands of years most dragaerans are attached to one of seventeen houses all of which have a different set of ideal

2896,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,when reading i sometimes get caught up with the wrong pronunciation and i have a far too hard time letting go even when someone corrects me i’m thankful that brust was kind enough to provide a pronunciation guide at the start of jhereg this way i hopefully won’t embarrass myself when discussing the book with anyone getting a significant name horribly wrong such as the title i originally picked up a beat up old copy of jhereg a year ago at a used book store i read through the prologue an
2897,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,this is a fantastic book and i highly recommend it if you want a fun read that doesn t constantly regurgitate the standard fantasy tropes the series is very well done and still continues to have solid additions i originally read this book while i was in med school borrowed it and a couple of the others in the series from a friend who recommended it about num years ago i ve started re reading the series recently and it s standing up well to the re read it s also useful because it s helping m
2898,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,num/num stars pretty decent book even though it was written more than num years ago i had a nice time with it not exciting times but enjoyable enough that i didn t feel checking the remaining time from now and then the book tells the story of a human called vlad taltos living in a fantasy world filled with long lived elf like creatures and dragons among other things sorcery and witchcraft is also very much alive here for instance the fastest way to move between places is to cast a teleportatio
2899,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,i m writing this review a month or so after i read the actual book so please bear with me when it comes to some lapses plot wise what s always attracted me to brust is that he brings a very florid touch to his fantasy fantasy and sci fi are sometimes dismissed as genres that pay more attention to world building than descriptive quality sci fi more than fantasy since fantasy has the foundational example of tolkien but brust is unabashedly literary the first book of his i ever read was i
2900,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,every time i reread this series i want to add another star funny since this is the first official goodreads read i ve done of this i ve tried changing editions it keeps showing me a cover i ve never seen in my life doesn t matter the covers i ve seen for this series are my vote for most inaccurate but still cool covers ever this one i see is inaccurate and also horrible unless it s an amber colored dragon esque thing coming out of an egg then it s the cover i know it s supposed to
2901,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,vlad taltos is a mobster and assassin and he s just landed a contract so lucrative he ll be set for life if that is he doesn t botch the job because this time his target is also a jhereg who knows how the game is played it won t be an easy kill but if he can t pull it off vlad won t be alive to worry about the consequences i finally got my hands on a copy of jhereg which i immediately devoured it s hard to believe this is the first book and that s not just because steven brust w
2902,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,in the num’s there was really only one kind of fantasy to speak of all of it was almost universally a tolkien ripoff then steven brust entered the scene with something that came from so far to the left that to this day people don’t really know how to take it jhereg is about a man living in a kingdom of demigods who live hundreds of thousands of years there is no quest there is very little travel vlad is not an uneducated scullery boy though he does start out waiting tables in his fathe
2903,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2,two things i wish i had read this in the nums when it came out and was fresh among all the tolkien clones and dammit i should have checked whether this series differs between publication and internal chronology order i much prefer to read in ic order and much happens between the start of this book and the actual story beginning num years later that is left completely unexplained which feels enormously distancing to me vlad taltos apparently gets married but falling in love courtship and
2904,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,when i first read listened to this book i rated it four stars but the rating went up with the reread and i m a little bit obsessed now the learning curve of the taltos books is relatively steep and the form of the story and the fact that the books weren t released in chronological order means that there are a lot of events alluded to that the new reader can have no knowledge of yet the prose and the voice of the character first person narration are also not something i d normaly gr
2905,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,i m a vlad taltos fan for many many years i ve read the entire series yes even the way off his game ones num num multiple times over the holidays on a long drive i thought the first volume would be a fun read for the family so i read it aloud to them over the course of seven hours or so it s still a faboo read with a ton of fun going for it but this time through i was aware of a few weaknesses in this first in the series novel that brust later gets a heck of a lot better at on the plus
2906,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,steven brust is by far my favorite author i have read every one of his books some of them several times i truly enjoy the worlds he has created in his novels jhereg was the first one to capture me and it was one of his first books it tells the story of a young assassin trying to make his way in the world from the very first passage i was completely enchanted it quickly skillfully drew me in heart and soul brust writes with wit humor and charm colorfully describing characters s
2907,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,in general you should really read this book xd i m pretty sure it s a ya book by the way regarding the plot the plot was really cool d vlad was hired to assassinate mellar look at description but basically he runs into a bunch of really interesting to me obstacles such as the fact that mellar is holed up inside of a castle who s guests are protected you are not allowed to kill them permanently you can revive people from the dead if their soul isn t removed but vlad needs to do that in o
2908,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,i love reading series i love being immersed in characters that are too complex or a world that has too much history for one book i love it when an author has so much invested in their creation that reading between the lines you know there is so much more to reveal i love it when the first book in the series only scratches the surface of what the author has imagined harry potter is like this so is the vorkosigan series by lois mcmaster bujold the pern series by anne mccaffery the expan

2910,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,num num stars some time ago i read a blog post called five books with unforgettable animal sidekicks pretty fun post with many books i am familair with and then somebody in comments mentioned vlad taltos and his animal sidekick loiosh and the more i read the more i got interested because loiosh is a small dragon loiosh is a dragon with personality of a cat loiosh has psychic bond with vlad and has the snarkiest comments and observations how can i resist that the truth is i am not sure i would g
2911,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,a sarcastic mob boss in a world where elves are the superior class and humans are oppressed fast paced and entertaining with a bit of destiny sewn in the framework of the universe 
2912,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2,vlad taltos is this guy right who has some buddies and they get together and plan out this caper he s a fairly typical protagonist in a fantasy novel he has a little dragon sidekick some elven friends a magical weapon etc vlad taltos is a psychopath and so is almost everyone he knows vlad himself has murdered num people for money he casually orders a young woman murdered simply because she is spreading some rumors his friend morrollan worships a demon goddess and blink and you will
2913,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,this is book one in the adventures of vlad taltos an unlikely of heroes the book begins with “there is a similarity if i may be permitted an excursion into the tenuous metaphor between the feel of a chilly breeze and the feel of a knife’s blade as either is laid across the back of your neck i can call up memories of both if i work at it the chilly breeze is invariably going to be the more pleasant memory ” the world in this series started much like ours but long long ago the jenoine po
2914,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,initially i was sad that i d finished all the locke lamora books that had been written to date despite its weird name i was thrilled when i chanced to open and start reading jhereg vlad taltos num because it had a lot of elements in common with our dear friend locke lamora and i was further thrilled that this is a series in which there are many books so i do not have to say goodbye to series that feature a single male starring character that has a seemingly mind reading best friend/fam
2915,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,this book is really clever like the central character it proves itself nimble and clever a fantasy version of the heist movie in a way in which the protagonist has to come up with an overly elaborate cunning plan to get his objective in this case to assassinate some one i found alot of elements of the world building fascinating actually humans who live as a persecuted minority in an empire of super long lived beings what assassination means in a world where magical resurrection is co
2917,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2,i ve been looking for a long satisfying fantasy series to dig into so i really wanted to love jhereg but sadly it was only competent not awesome brust has a lot of things going for him the mythology seems original and well constructed that i d guess it unfolds slowly as the series goes on the worldbuilding is excellent too brust parcels it out in little chunks the story is well paced what i like best though is that brust is refreshingly unpretentious as far as i can tell jhereg is
2918,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2,entertaining but bleh but it s purely because of my own personal hatred for that private eye style writing and the style of story telling that develops using untold stories that s when a character refers to an event that happened at an early date in order to reveal to the reader how experienced they are and how on the edge they live without telling anything else worth a damn it s when a character will say to another something like oh no not like the tower jumping in the george case the
2919,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,in this one we meet vlad for the first time and learn about the jhereg and the dragaera in general we learn how loiosh came to be with vlad as well as how rocza came into their lives the basic story is of an assassination vlad must carry out however the target has taken refuge in morrolan s castle black and as such he cannot be assaulted without incurring morrolan s wrath on the other hand if he isn t taken out soon the house of jhereg will suffer permanent damage to their reputation and
2920,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,let me start with a disclaimer it s possible the rating on this was a touch lower than the quality of the work would indicate i read this in a print omnibus edition the book was heavy the type was tiny both made reading difficult given my severe arthritis i m including that in the review though because if a book is inaccessible or difficult to consume that s a barrier to the audience i honestly don t know why ace doesn t convert the first num books in the series to ebook that being said 
2921,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,i love when you read a book and you know the writer just had a big shit eating grin on their face with every keypress i feel like these books would be a hard sell to a lot of people i know because they re just stupidly fun each book is short and snappy and reminds me a lot of the dresden files there s a great supporting cast there s awesome plots to unravel there s deeper mysteries steven brust loves writing and this series so far i ve read four books just reads like a labor of love 
2922,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,i was quite impressed with how much i liked this book considering how often some books from the num s and num s don t hold up well to start off with i really loved the way the author built the world there wasn t a straight man to explain everything to but with the story being told from the recollection of the main character there are plenty of places to explain something that s been mentioned a time or two to flesh out the idea the book is pretty short for what i normally like to read and
2923,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,jhereg by steven brust is a great book it really gives you some insight as to what an assassin does and how he thinks as the plot develops the reader really gets a glimpse into the mind of vlad taltos and it feels as if we are struggling with him trying to plan out how to get the guy brust also adds elements of comedy and fun into this seemingly dark book about assassination we learn that vlad isn t just a cold hearted killer but he does what he has to do to get by as an easterner in the
2924,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,it s been a while since i picked up a book that i have legitimately been unable to put down this is a book that i picked up one evening and found myself reading until far to late in the morning the story is great i appreciated the way that brust simply thrust me into his world it s filled with unique fantastic creatures that he takes no breath to explain to me i had the feeling of someone truly stepping into a fantasy and constantly wondering ohhh what is that the writing is not perfect th
2925,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,jupp i still give num stars actually i m really relieved that i still love the story there are a couple of books from my youth which i really really liked back in the days and now they disappoint me but not vlad and loiosh i love the style the story is narrated in it s refreshing and direct vlad has his flaws and strenghts lot s of ego perspective narratives suffer from annoyingly perfect protagonists their stories are full of shining moments and how they handled everything with ease i p
2926,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,i was glad to reread this book for the first time in more than num years it s a lot of fun fast moving sardonic and intelligent it has some of the flavor of urban fantasy while set in a secondary world and it also reminded me strongly of the recent debut among thieves by doug hulick there s lots of casual violence and morally questionable behavior here but we are still left with the impression of strong codes of honor being adhered to as for the prose brust does a great job of buildin
2927,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,this is a fantasy book yes with all the kingdoms intrigue magic and invincible swords one expects from a fantasy what makes jhereg more than typical fantasy however is vlad the first person narrator who reads like an escapee from a contemporary mystery novel who just happens to be living in a world where humans are an inconsequential minority vlad s got a modern sensibility hey he s just a guy trying to make his way in a world that makes this such an incredibly entertaining rea
2928,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,the star rating given reflects my opinion within ‘the official goodreads rating system’ notice the two important words opinion and rating num star didn’t like it num stars it’s okay num stars liked it num stars really liked it num stars it was amazing i don’t really give a rat fuck that there are some who think i ‘owe’ an explanation for my opinion nope nada and not sorry about it sometimes i may add notes to explain what my opinions are based on and sometimes i don’t i do this for me on my boo
2929,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,this is the first in the long running vlad taltos series it s an interesting mix of politics crime and fantasy all mixed in a blender and topped with a healthy dose of sarcasm vlad taltos lives in a society where humans are basically second class citizens that s okay though because he s an assassin and things are going pretty well for him especially when he gets a high paying contract to take out a politician who embezzled a substantial sum from political group i m being very vague he
2930,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,i did like the book and the story but it wasn t very fantasyish in my opinion and as such i didn t like it as much as i could have there was no world building aside from a few snips here and there which is fine if you aren t looking for that kind of book personally for how short the book is i found all of the houses / clans to be cumbersome and un necessary aside from a few references here and there it just seemed to be clunky i realize that there is a whole series here and i ll p
2931,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,obviously this is a classic fantasy novel and the series has been around forever but for some reason i never got around to it i knew the main character was an assassin so i thought this was going to be really dark it wasn t at all it was just kind of normal with a faint sprinkle of kinda lame humor i almost stopped reading it about num pages in but then the plot got interesting and kept getting more interesting it was a short book so i stuck it out and actually enjoyed it there seems to be
2932,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,jhereg and really all of brust s work was recommended to me by the book what makes this book so great i finally got a hold of a copy of jhereg a couple of weeks ago and was finally able to read it after new year s i enjoyed jhereg it was interesting exciting and set in a fascinating world i liked the characters all of which had depth and breadth i especially liked that the women characters were strong but varied so that they weren t stereotyped or carbon copies the only problem i had
2933,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2,steven brust is another one of those authors that i somehow managed to miss when i was younger even though he has quite a few novels to his credit and a sizable fan following i was wanting something light and adventurous having gotten bogged down in the middle of lawrence durrell s clea jhereg was what i expected a clean no frills adventure of an assassin who might have taken a job that was too much for him i sit thinking about that last line and the possibility that i may have offended th
2934,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,vlad has been paid heavily in advance by very violent powerful men to perform an assassination failure is not an option and success becomes more impossible at every turn author steven brust sets this action thriller in a fantasy world that is rich and fleshed out for instance race relations are ugly between the easterners who are built like us and the seven foot tall dragaerans who live for centuries each race calls themselves human vlad has a telepathic link with an intelligent win
2935,Jhereg,Steven Brust,1,not good not good at all this is a good example of the one eyed guy being king in land of the blind i hate books where the main characters in this case vlad appear intelligent only cause everyone else is an idiot there s attempt to manufacture suspense but the david goliath complex crap is not appealing and requires too much suspension of intellect the whole premise is that a guy on the all powerful council carries out a huge heist and some little shit head gets him presumably because cou
2936,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,i fell in love with steven brust s world i love how the humans are second class citizens which is a turn about in fantasy sci fi etc who can t love a thief/witch with a pet dragon like reptile that calls him boss telepathically but with much sarcasm the characters are more than a bit interesting in these books another interesting thing is how easily brust changes styles of writing the vlad taltos series tends to border on modern language and culture while the books in the phoenix guar
2937,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,vlad is a human an easterner living amongst reptilian like creatures he is an outsider but his father has bought a title into the house of jhereg an accomplished assassin he is faced with the daunting task of finding a member of the council who has stolen nine million in gold before word gets out and the security of the council safe is questioned the culprit named meller is hiding in a castle of a powerful lord who does not allow his guests to be attacked whilst in his home as vlad figures o
2938,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,i loved this book when i read it nearly num years ago and was thrilled to get back to it on audio i had some initial concerns about the narration because the first person narrator came across as relatively flat but the addition of more characters makes it clear that the wry flat smartass note to the pov character s voice is intentional and it s eminently suitable to the character the narrator does a stellar job with this cast of characters differentiating several female characters numer
2939,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,one of my favorite series that i periodically re read vlad taltos human easterner jhereg crime boss witch assassin is introduced along with his familiar loiosh wife cawti dragaeran friends sethra lavode morrolan aliera krager and others in this book someone has ripped off the jhereg council and he s hired to take care of the problem we re introduced into a complicated long con by the guy who did it and an equally convoluted solution to the problem of how to destroy him before a
2940,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,this book reminds me of jim butcher s harry dresden in terms of tone wit plot style combat and character interactions if you like jim s work but want to read some high fantasy instead of urban fantasy try this on for size  this book is fun with fun characters an enthralling setting and a gripping plot jhereg is great the book throws you in deep from page num similar to the malazan series for a lack of a tutorial beginning throwing all sorts of worldbuilding at you without mercy for yo
2941,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,i needed something that would qualify as a pocket book for various trips around town so this one came off the shelf it s just as relentlessly engaging as the first time i read it and the second time for that matter it s a bit rough around the edges compared to brust s later work but the skill wit which he lays out the world that he has spent the last num decades playing around in and viewing the background events discuss in this book from very different angles is impressive i should give th
2942,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,interesting as a first book as it provides backstory for history that makes this seem more like a second or third book has a fast pace and reasonably interesting socio/political world the short length makes you quickly move to the next book to find out more 
2943,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,this felt more like a short story aimed to get the prospective readers anchored to the universe and its characters everything was just a bit too shallow for my taste things weren t epic enough yet and i am stressing the yet in that sentence because i strongly believe that the story will get more in depth as it builds on ergo i am still going to read the rest of the series for vlad is great also it is an easy relaxing read narrator is not volatile nor undependable possessing of
2944,Jhereg,Steven Brust,4,the first book in steven brust s very popular line of vlad taltos novels jhereg introduces a very rich and compelling fantasy universe with sci fi undertones that successfully combines classic fantasy elements with modern sensibilities vlad is an assassin for what is essentially the mafia of his world and the mafioso elements combine quite well with all the tools that fantasy worlds have to offer an assassin that must deal with targets who can teleport for example as with most of brust s
2945,Jhereg,Steven Brust,2,i feel like i should like this book i even didn t object to a lot of it in theory but at the end of the day every line came across as almost scalzi level arrogance masquerading as wit and almost nothing happened there were i think three scenes in the whole book where something happened besides people talking the familiar was basically a disney talking animal sidekick and was even less funny than everything else in the book now that i m finished i don t know what i was supposed to gain
2946,Jhereg,Steven Brust,3,righto so i started with the “first” book of the series at least the first book that the publisher thinks comes first not the one that chronologically comes first i enjoyed it it’s a fun light read with little seriousness a bit of campy here and there fun roller coaster type plot and entertaining interesting characters that i cared about vlad is a fun narrator and keeps the pace of the book very fast and the tone very modern things move briskly from page one and don’t stop until t
2947,Jhereg,Steven Brust,5,this is an amazing book a window into a world ruled by elves where humans are a marginalized minority it s a magic system story and an elven culture story and the story of one of the greatest heists the world has seen this book is so amazing that it spawned about twelve direct or indirect sequels most of which are based on parts of vlad taltos s life that are actually kind of boring but they all share the vlad style and they all have steven brust s excellent narrative and that makes ma
2948,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,num num stars piers anthony is a mind numbing enigma to me he is capable of writing extremely thought provoking imaginative stories that are both original and speak to fundamental aspects of the human condition the mystery is that he does so infrequently despite being one of the most prolific authors in the speculative fiction wait on second thought maybe that is the answer quantity of production slamming right into the proverbial nuts of quality well this first novel in the incarnation
2949,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,this was the first book i ever read of piers anthony and i was hooked original imaginative and told by a true story teller this was a gem and best of all this blended good science fiction with pure fantasy elements to make a very enjoyable read a man accidentally kills death an incarnation of immortality and shades of tim allen in the santa clause he must don the black mantle and ride the white horse it turns out to be a white car and a pretty cool gig when all is settled that is un
2950,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,this is the first in the incarnations of immortality series and probably the best of the batch i believe i read somewhere that anthony originally intended only to write the five death time fate war and earth and i think he probably should have stopped there because while with a tangled skein is probably the best book of the series in terms of pulling the other books together they did as sci fi series so often do start to drag quite a bit towards the later books and ended up just pl
2951,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,1,ok i think it s time to delve into my long evolving and conflicted feelings about this series and about piers anthony especially since i changed my rating for this book from a num to a num when i was young i loved this series it was on my favourites list throughout high school i was also pretty obsessed with the xanth series and would get new books from that series for many christmases and birthdays these series and piers in general go into my adult category of things i can t believe i didn
2952,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,originally posted at fantasy literature when the grim reaper shows up a few seconds early zane shoots him instead of using the gun on himself as he’d planned now instead of being dead zane is death he has to take over the office riding around the world in his convertible pale horse collecting and measuring the souls of those who’ve committed equal amounts of good and evil during their lives — those who are “in balance ” in his new guise complete with all of the accoutrements scythe hood
2953,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,this was the book that got me into reading fiction many years ago and inspired me to want to write the reading happened straight away and i ve not stopped since the writing took a little longer to get started and i see no sign of stopping that now either so reading for the second time many years later much of the narrative feels a little dated in regard to social references and attitudes but i enjoyed the story just as much as i did as a young man now i feel compelled to reread the rest
2954,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,maybe a better title for this book would be euthanasia rocks i honestly thought i would like this book a whole lot more it doesn t help that the impetus for my reading this book was a good friend s rusty memory of reading this in high school i feel that would have been a great time to read it now less so my main problem was the annoying protagonist i don t know if this was something that was a rule for fantasy writing in the nums but what is with the protagonist who s characterized as
2955,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,actual rating num num stars i can see where i would have been really into this series if i’d read it as a teenager i was just busy reading at that point in my life and not very much into evaluating what i was taking in it is a very male oriented story with women being mostly objects that they compete for and fight over the male characters evaluate women by their age and attractiveness although zane/death comes to grudgingly admire luna’s strength intelligence and morality if i had children 
2956,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,reread this for the first time in num years enjoyed it but not as much as books by atwood or gaiman
2957,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,death does ride a pale horse but that horse can be so much more if that is what the job calls for or at least that is what anthony will have us believe a friend of mine in high school pushed this series on me and i reluctantly started to read it have i mentioned that science fiction really isn t my favorite yet because yeah it takes something special for me to really delve into science fiction not that this is science fiction per say but more like an alternate earth with some futuristic ele
2958,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,on a pale horse is the best book piers anthony s ever written sadly that s not saying much anthony has some very creative ideas but his prose is mechanical at best and plainly clunky at worst even so some of the ideas are worth the slog the incarnations of immortality series though it fades at the end as all of anthony s series do is a clever and occasionally inspired look at religion spirituality and morality in different hands it might have been pure art see also good omens by prat
2959,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,piers anthony is an author who is more conceptually innovative than literary his writing is like puff pastry and not very substantive but his characters are likable and the plots engaging he has moments of preachiness mixed in and sometimes a puerile sense of humor but if you don t mind these things or indeed revel in them you should give him a try none of anthony s books takes long to read and you ll be able to tell by the first num pages of a series whether you re into his concept th
2960,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,i think this is a case of it s not you it s me this is a very popular book but everyone that i personally know that has read and loved it say they read it way back in the num s or num s i wonder if they would still feel the same way if they read it for the first time today i ve just read too many outstanding fantasy novels this year so this book had big shoes to fill unfortunately it fell short i m not sure why but i went into this book expecting it to be funny i was actually looking forward
2961,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,1,okay i m done i made it num hours and num minutes into the audiobook and this just isn t good it starts with one of the most most blatant cases of the trope women as rewards i ve seen in popular fiction and just keeps piling them on it s gross i stopped just after the female football team with the invisible protective gear and mammary glands likened to those of goats how that s sexy i m not sure but piers anthony didn t spare the adjectives he took several passes after the goat udder 
2962,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,1,i first read this book back when i was num and loved it immediately tore through the rest of the books in the series and would regularly bring up the series in conversations about books worth reading a few months back i found a paperback copy of on a pale horse at a book sale for num cents and picked it up thinking it d be fun to revisit the series well this is an extraordinarily sexist book alarmingly so women are regularly approximately every time they are talked about described by thei
2963,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,it’s my first time reading anthony and overall i enjoyed this story yes it’s dated yep definitely some unnecessary female sexualization but overall i liked the story and it was a fun read juxtaposed with my current political read i liked the play of good verses evil and all the grey areas the exploration of original sin and what if bad things are done for good reasons it was a bit too simple in some places but overall interesting read 
2964,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,i’ve long been a fan of anthropomorphized versions of death this is probably not surprising since we have been doing this for thousands of years to varying degrees of sophistication and some do it better than others i’m a big fan of julian richings’ portrayal of death on supernatural he captures the eerie inhuman quality of death as a force of nature older than god so well managing to appear suave and completely cold at the same time plus he kind of looks the part in on a pale horse 
2965,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,one summer while in jr high my brother handed me a book the cover was yellow and depicted death driving a very nice looking sports car i loved the book and unlike anthony s xanth series incarnations is still very readable for me today i ve heard the argument that many feel that anthony has far too many sexual scenes in the incarnations books i guess i never really latched onto those scenes as being particularly offensive there are worse books than these out there for that the books thems
2966,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,well i enjoyed the author s note that was entertaining i read he does that at the end of all of his books as for the book itself i m not too sure what i liked the idea of the story death as a real man unwittingly thrust into the role and having to figure it out as he went i liked mortis the horse/limousine i liked satan advertising on billboards that hell is actually a fun place to be i was a big fan of dead like me and was so bummed when they canceled that series there were actua
2967,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,the gospel according to piers anthony is mismanaged and a little boring we re compelled to wade through half a novel of false doctrine before hitting actual storyline every chapter plants a seed of what s to come but it is slow and tedious until the last few chapters had i read only the second half of the novel i think i might have enjoyed it it is a wildly creative story embedding future fantasy and religion piers anthony is thoroughly self absorbed this novel embodies his great love
2968,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,this is the only piers anthony book i really liked for once there s enough actual plot to distract the author from his usual preoccupations of breasts and bad puns the premise is similar to the santa clause but instead of the jolly old elf it s the grim reaper who kicks the bucket erm gets shot to death by the protagonist it s an accident okay now the protagonist has to take his place and figure out all the gadgets death uses to find the souls he collects there s a cool car/horse an
2969,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,i decided to reread this series when i learned there was an eighth book i could probably go straight to the eighth book no problem but i remembered liking this series and i still do the concept is very clever that each of the incarnations is a regular person fulfilling a job death becomes death by killing the former death afterward he has to learn the ins and outs of his job making sure the souls that are roughly in balance end up going to the right place haven or hell and satan 
2970,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,this was the beginning of my piers anthony kick a couple years ago this series was very interesting it is called the incarnations of immortality with this first book being the best of the series the others were interesting the premise is that regular people take on the mantle of death the fates mother nature mars father time etc there are a total of seven books so you can guess who the numth and numth are i never could get ahold of the numth book and i m not one to skip on to the last wit
2971,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,i very much enjoyed this fantasy book that focused on the office of death and it s coorelation with the other incarnations it s cause and effect logic was always sound and infuriatingly obvious after reading the explanation of the logic the author did a great job keeping the reader s emotions on par with the protagonist zane even feeling the frustration and eventual enlightenment that he experienced one more note mortis is awesome 
2972,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,in my opinion this is the best of the incarnations series interesting where the guy discovers he s become the new incarnation of death and of course how he became death i think this was a pretty good book and it s one of only a few anthony books i really like i read a few others of the incarnation series and incidental other anthony books not in general a fan of his 
2973,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,i first read this series in high school i loved it sometime toward the end of my college career i bought the series and began reading it again i loved it a little less let s start with the major problem i have with this series piers anthony writes almost every single female character as some crazy or weak person that needs a man to come save the day how insulting as if women can t be just as tough reasonable or resilient as men i don t know how i missed it the first go round maybe i f
2974,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,from memory read this as a young man and liked it enough to read the entire series a mortal takes over as the nearly immortal death very entertaining 
2975,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,book one of incarnations of immortality the story of a regular guy zane who after a run of bad luck decides to commit suicide but instead as fate would have it is picked to assume the office of death the job comes with any number a perks a shapechanging deathhorse a manor in purgatory and who knows what powers zane needs to figure that out as he goes along collecting the sould of those whose lives are in balance neither good nor evil to be sorted out and sent to hell heaven o
2976,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,in retrospect this book reminds me a little bit of terry pratchett s mort though on a pale horse predates it the idea of death as an office rather than an entity was very original at the time and the adventures of the protagonist in this book as a rookie grim peaper is a lot of fun the main difference between this book and mort is the tone the emphasis of this book is on action and adventuires rather than comedy this is the first of piers anthony s incarnations of immortality series and is
2977,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,this book did not age well i realize that this book is a product of its time but boy howdy the sexism in this book is really bad i tried to read it mad men style trying to look past it but because the book hinges on this i found it impossible i have read a lot of books from this time period stranger in a strange land is one i still enjoy despite it s sexism this book just can t escape it i picked up this book after hearing the tal story about piers anthony i realized i had not read any
2978,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,it is the outstanding first book in the incarnations of immortality series recommended to me by my father who read it when he was my age the series questions the nature of life by having mortals take on immortal offices which they can execute in whichever way they so choose for the most part anyway this book in particular follows the story of zane and then luna his soul is fairly balanced between good and evil or at least enough so that he has to be attended to by death himself when he tr
2979,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,besides the fact that piers anthony is still oh so sexist though not as bad as in the xanth series and the fact that he can t write female characters to save his life i still do enjoy this book others have said that this one is the best of the series and i think i agree though i also really enjoyed num though most say the last two books suck i definitely enjoyed the re read and i am definitely looking forward to reading the next one but i m going to try to take a break from anthony f
2980,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,this was a neat new take for a fantasy subject blended some light sf as well i really enjoyed it although the series got a bit redundant for me after several books i did finish keep the series i reread it a year or two ago would recommend it 
2981,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,possible the best book that i have read this is a straight faced comedy about a man who by accident kills death i think that i read it all in one day great story 
2982,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,a great exploration of death by an author who makes it fun and poignant 
2983,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,if the forces of nature were real persons in the eigh book fantasy series “the incarnations of immortality” piers anthony brings us to a fantasy world ruled by magic and advanced technology where the forces of nature are incarnated by human beings who are temporary selected to preserve the equilibrium of the world in this first part of the series we focus on the story of the young zane who is assigned to carry out the office of death throughout the first part of the book we follow him whi
2984,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,1,while piers anthony’s on a pale horse the first book in his incarnations of immortality series has an interesting central premise this is completely overwhelmed by the fact it is juvenile sexist lazy and the highest crime of all not very well written i had read and loved these books when i was a young teenager—the principal audience for anthony’s work i imagine—and was far more forgiving and less discerning in my tastes in general in those days now revisiting the series decades later
2985,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,piers anthony s on a pale horse is compelling and intelligent the novel tells the story of zane the new incarnation of death in the immediate aftermath of his taking of the office this book performs on multiple levels simultaneously on the first it is an active and adventuresome fantasy novel full of magic and cryptic characters emotionally charged moments and plots all the trappings of a good tale no more and no less on the second it opens into a broad and interesting tale of the conf
2986,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,i first read this series when i was in college the first time so that would have been in the early num s say around num num or so and i absorbed this series reading all num books our library had i remember the series seemed to be of less quality as i went along but i must have enjoyed them because i read all the books i had access to at the time someone recently suggested i read them and to be perfectly frank i had forgotten i had already read the series until this person brought up the name
2987,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,i have mixed thoughts about this book anthony s writing at times is amusing but is equally often stilted and forced in the author s note at the end anthony acknowledges that he wrote the book not only to be entertaining as fantasy but as a satiric commentary on the ills or evils of society the world that anthony constructs in this book is amusing and creative it s in the details the situations characters and dialogue where anthony doesn t live up to the potential of the world i don 
2988,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,this is a reread the first time i read this was when it was first released in the nums when zane becomes suicidal he tries take his own life due to a twist of fate literally he manages to kill the grim reaper and when you kill the reaper you become the next reaper this urban fantasy is both gently satiric and slightly noir in tone zane learns how to do his job being thanatos the literal personification of death it turns out to be an interesting job he learns how to take souls an
2990,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,so my uncle gave me this and the rest of the series of books when i was younger i devoured this book i had never really been into any sort of sci fi/fantasy genre before at least not something like this book the concept of having death be a person and the ability to accidentally kill death and you become him just blew my mind when i was younger i love this book it s funny it keeps you intrigued it expands the universe in which it is set by having you see view spoiler [purgatory hide s
2991,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,this was quite good how could you go wrong with a story about a hapless schmuck who kills death and therefore must take over his job it s a quick read with some truely sentimental moments a few funny ones and several interesting ideas on the whole life/death thing this is the first novel in the incarnations series but this is the only one i was really interested in so it stops for me here a recommended fun read 
2992,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,another example of how piers anthony can start a series with interesting concepts and characters and run it into the ground i really liked the first couple of books of the incarnations of immortality series but they quickly became repetitive and tiresome especially as anthony increasingly made authorial speeches through the characters 
2993,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,this is actually my second read through it has been many years and once again i am not disappointed anthony’s personification of death is amazing witty and thought provoking between humor and a well thought out story you grow to become death’s fan and even have a better understanding of his necessity i now own all seven books and cannot wait to see what’s next 
2994,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,imo this was the best of the series by far often have the desire to re read this 
2995,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,this was my first jump into piers anthony upon recommendation and i’m actually super surprised i hadn’t read him before his work in both science and fantasy fiction should be right up my alley for the type of books i consumed rapidly in my younger years for the most part that’s how i felt about this book too that i would have liked it a lot more if i had read it in high school i’m not sure that’s a statement about the book so much as it is about me i used to read with more speed and less c
2996,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,i remember this book as being really entertaining and thought provoking as a teenager as an adult it was okay and very nostalgic to read but the way he writes is so odd and stuff and formal ish if that makes sense it’s hard to get swept up by the story there are also some troublingly racist and sexist scenes and some just general squickiness a lot of weird children of rape stuff there is still some things to think about and it’s a very imaginative story and i really liked that the a
2997,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,this was a spur of the moment re read of a book that i dearly loved when it came out in point of fact i really loved the series in general though some were stronger than others this being the first i think of the original num it was among the best so why only num stars out of num my age and outlook have changed more and more i ve come to the opinion that while i enjoy mr anthony s plots i don t much like the man who writes these books while i clearly didn t notice the underlying note of se
2998,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,i think many if not most readers have that one author who they really really enjoy reading or enjoyed reading at one time but looking at him objectively realize that he s a very problematic author for me that author is piers anthony he can be an incredibly imaginative writer when he wants to be some of the worlds he’s created and some of the ideas he’s written about in his novels are just brilliant he can also write the most meandering dull preachy and nonsensical stories ever put
2999,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,one of the regular patrons at my job recommended this book and i am thankful that he did i really enjoyed this book and would not have picked it to read without the recommendation this book was very different than the books i normally read and i found it to be extremely enjoyable 
3000,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,a wonderfully intriguing tale of death aka the grim reaper personified i really enjoy piers anthony s gift at storytelling and creating well rounded characters the kind of characters you want to get to know there was a bit too much of christian sounding ideology god and the devil stuff but still this was definitely an interesting take on death as a man with a conscience death as a helper and a guide 
3001,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,i picked up this audiobook on cds for a recent trip i was taking without knowing the author or realizing that it was originally published in num though i m a fan of the scifi and fantasy genres and i appreciate the overlay religious philosophy overall the work felt simplistic in its morality tale and often offensive in its depiction of women often i find scifi/alt future fiction from decades ago can betray their age through references to technology that date the work by noting a lack of a
3002,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,death faces a moral dilemma num january num i guess once again my list is going to be over balanced with all of the piers anthony books that i have read to be honest on top of these there are two more series apprentice adept and bio of a space tyrant that i have also read and that is not counting the twelve odd books that i read from the xanth series one may wonder why i read so many piers anthony books and why i am actually admitting that i did well first of all most of the books that
3003,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,this book was if i remember correctly the first book by piers anthony i ever read during the early years of high school i devoured dozens more sometimes two or more in a week but i seem to remember taking my time with this one and re reading it at least once before moving on to anything else it impressed me deeply at the time and i was sorry that the next books in the series hadn’t come out yet i remember being disappointed by them when they did because to my mind they didn’t stand up
3004,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,when zane hits an all time low in his life he decided to end it when death walked through his apartment door the sight of him startles zane and he shoots death instead the second death’s body hits the floor fate walks in informing zane of his new occupation death the man who murders death becomes him zane finds himself suddenly claiming the souls of those who passed away with a nearly equal slate to determine whether they go to heaven or hell but when zane questions the rules things
3005,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,conceptually on a pale horse is an interesting novel a man named zane kills death and takes the mantle of the grim reaper forced to traverse the world and pass judgment on souls that are gray rather than black or white what ensues is a long drawn out repetitive series of events that are meant to be intelligent reflections on morality and mortality but increasingly become boring silly adventures in wheel spinning flipping through the book you get the impression that there s going to be a
3006,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,i hated this book virtually from page num as soon as i realized that the interesting basic idea of a human taking the office and job of death is going to be ruined by juvenile writing style and frequent but needless attempts of light humor a la terry pratchett at that point i was also paying big money for the smallest and worst pizza i ever ate in my entire life courtesy of pizza hut so that did not help matters either a couple of weeks and num pages later i can say that my initial dislike
3007,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,i remember reading piers anthony as a kid the book i had read was for love of evil which i d like to re read at some point but i had never read about his incarnation of death i am fascinated by points of view of normally feared characters like death or the devil i think that there is always more than one side to a story and i love exploring that so on a pale horse was like catnip for cats to me i liked his very human characterization of death i liked that death made mistakes very funn
3008,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,i ve been wanting to read this book for a long time and i was very happy to find that it did not disappoint anthony uses a fascinating blend of science/technology and magic to create a unique world where flying carpets and winged horses are used for transportation along with cars and planes the story follows a man who ends up taking the place of death one of several other incarnations or offices of the universe filled by those who were once mortal i love the blend of fun storytelling with
3009,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,this book is absolutely fantastic i am curious if other writers using the same conceits have commented on this i would consider it pretty much required reading for scifi / fantasy fans this is one of those books where the idea is brilliant and he plays it out over and over and over again to the point where each repetition is breaking important new creative ground also like other genre books that create genre s a lot of what he is doing here seems easy but is really amazing when you consider
3010,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,i think that piers anthony s creativity is laudable the book is about a man who becomes death and has to deal with his views on the one subject most would rather not think about this book was actually a great concept and obviously has meaningful implications in how death should be interpreted it makes you think the drawback to this it also makes you think about how important serious revision i e rewrites are i found myself as an aspiring writer wanting to take some of his better scene
3011,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,pros interesting characters and conflicts with pacing and action you just can t put down death served as a solid everyman figure with underdog appeal and really served as a good introduction to the setting the very ending although not the circumstances that lead up to it is quite good cons the fantasy/tech mix is kind of lazy and the setting seems like window dressing but with a weird moral outlook crammed in it treats women like objects the protagonist s internal monologue is often whi
3012,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,the first book of the incarnations of immortality series follows the life of zane who at the end of his rope decides to commit suicide in an act self preservation he shoots death who has come to reap his soul after this zane takes the mantle as the new death and must manage his difficult duties to ensure that the world continues in a moderately normal fashion the main plot concerns zane attempting to save his love interest luna from the hands of satan although generally the novel best succe
3013,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,on a pale horse the first book in the incarnations of immortality series is a novel about a man named zane who finds himself taking over the job of death after shooting the previous owner of that title he must now collect souls and determine whether they should go to heaven or hell death of course comes on a pale horse hence the title written by the well known fantasy author piers anthony the story takes place in current time where one can travel by magic carpet or vehicle along his t
3014,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,on a pale horse has a quick beginning the reality of magic and science being equally forceful on earth is established quickly as is the plot zane is a loser who has wrecked his life to such an extent that he sees no other choice but to kill himself death came to collect him a little early and zane ended up killing him forcing zane to replace him in the office of the incarnation of death the tales of death as seen through the perspective of death are interesting as is the satanic plot tha
3015,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,if you had asked me num pages into the book i probably would have rated it num stars num pages into the book it was about num num pages into the book it was num you get the picture here i honestly can t say what exactly caused this book to deteriorate so much over the course of the plot i think a lot of it had to do with the actual plot the plot was extremely jumbled as though the author had decided he needed every element—romance humor religion sci fi science and horror basically imagin
3016,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5, death came with friendly care my god i love this book pun intended this is the third time i have read this book the first time probably in the early nums was my first book of this genre i was a very reluctant reader of fantasy but an ex boyfriend told me i would love it that was the only thing he got right haha trying to recollect but the only other book i can come up with that i read three times is pride and prejudice well mr anthony you are in very good company with ms austen th
3017,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,my first time reading this since i was num i think back in high school i was huuuugely into the incarnations of immortality series also the xanth series and apparently wasn t too concerned about the awkward writing and low key misogyny found in most of piers anthony s books these are glaring issues for me now yet i still enjoyed the book he has some great ideas about the nature of death and death and was able to carry some of the scenes off really well of course there s the nostalgia
3018,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,death is personified screw up makes good uses power to stop suffering of dying in teens reader usually sees long life ahead old age is a mystery first fine impression held over num years worth re read surprisingly series tangles by love swamps in quasi science and brain puzzlers sinks on re read long author s notes add insight perspective when zane shoots death he has to take the job mortis pale horse / limo speeds over the world he measures souls in exact balance of good and e
3019,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,as a writer wannabe i thought the concept of this story was fascinating death comes to claim a suicide victim zane but after many years in the position of death becomes a little sloppy and allows the victim sees death right before killing himself zane freaks out and in a panic fires the gum at death instead succeeding in killing him death now zane must pick up the reins and take over becoming death himself an intersting take and very tongue and cheek as zane learns the job and
3020,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,the book that seriously sparked my interest in reading i was ditching a class in high school and decided to hide in the library which i knew no one would ever think of looking there for me a good friend had been working in the library at the time and i asked him to throw me a book in case anyone actually saw me on a pale horse was handed to me and i decided to read the first part i was totally absorbed into the book and went out that day to a bookstore and bought the first few books of
3021,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,my ninth grade english teacher assigned this as extra credit i had heard about this book a year earlier when i was sitting with a friend waiting for an ambulance to show up i thought he d addled his brains until freshman year zane has lost everything watching his future disappear in a world that equally embraces magic and modern technology he finally decides that suicide is his only option however zane didn t expect to have the grim reaper walk through the door the surprise leads him to r
3022,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,this could be a little twisty at times and you really need to get your head around the premise of the novel in order to enjoy it i found the beginning a little hard to place as i wasn t sure if this was some sort of pseudo modern era or what type of genre it was aiming for you re pretty much left to believe that magic is commonplace and that satan advocates for souls freely without much explanation as to why it is the case explanations come a plenty later on so you just have to roll with it
3023,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,honestly this wasn t what i was expecting i m a fan of the xanth series and i thought this would be a light hearted adventure with some laughs of course my own life grew grim just as i got into the book as my mother unexpectedly passed away my own situation mirrored zane s in a small way as my family had to make the decision to take my mom off life support to end her needless suffering i have to say that i found it very comforting to read about a compassionate death during that difficu
3024,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,1,do you like constant sat vocab dropping how about some super confusing story lines or maybe just too many themes in one place then this is the book for you blah i just couldn t like it like i wanted to i love fantasy but this was way too pretentious for a fantasy novel his writing took away from the story the premise was really interesting and i was excited to read it but i knew from the first page that i would hate it i will not be continuing the series or picking up another one of hi
3025,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,the writing is terrible and action scenes are as corny as they can get but i am giving an extra star for original concept death as an office assumed by a mortal and unique world blend of science fiction and fantasy as well as another star for the first few gripping chapters if the writing didn t go downhill from there this book would be an instant favorite anthony introduced too many loopholes to make his character get out of unbelievable situations that after a while it began to loo
3026,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,1,did you ever see the video of two chatbots talking to each other the dialogue in this book was somehow less interesting and engaging than that video the characters were flat and when talking were completely indistinguishable except when tagged with their name zane said the only way i could finish the book was to imagine that each character was a robot trying to learn what it means to have emotions by studying people as they died 
3027,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,oh piers anthony you re so insane on a pale horse is an incredible novel the numst book in the incarnations of immortality series some books are better than others and it ended decades ago with and eternity unfortunately anthony decided to adapt some fanfic and release under a velvet cloak an numth book about nox let s not discuss how bad the first half of that novel was and concentrate on how awesome his original series was 
3028,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,i thought the premise for this story was promising and the modernization of an old story was a fun idea that said the promise was never quite fulfilled and the fun was never quite enough when our sorta hero accidentally kills death he has to take on the job and learn as he goes he spends the vast majority of the book just being confused and trying to save his love interest it just wasn t enough to stimulate the imagination or an interest in the rest of the series 
3029,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,why did no one tell me that fantasy is full of poetry seriously by the numrd page i was hooked on allusions to henley and wordsworth and midway through chapter num i found i loved zane and his story as much as the prose and anthony s poetic allusions and what an author s note often author s notes are not worth the cost of the pages they are printed on not so here a very pleasant introduction to what i hope will become a very enjoyable series 
3030,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,this novel was first recommended to me num years ago and i have finally gotten around to read it amazingly this novel has stood the test of time marvelously this book is as relevant today as it was num years ago all about the character of death himself scicle and everything this is a wonderful examination of death life and love surprisingly i enjoyed this novel tremendously and recommend it to all 
3031,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,i read this the first time when i was a kid and really liked it then i wasn t quite as taken with it this time but then it s not necessarily going to be better the second time around it is a good plot idea and it was a fun quick read i think anthony has a little bit of the pervy teenage boy mentality when it comes to female characters they are all either in the plot to be protected for to provide nurturing 
3032,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,read this as per a reading assignment the teacher accused me of wanting to read this because of the groovy cover i said that s not the case at all it was a nice cover something about a guy who is hired to become death hijinks ensue the only piers anthony book i ve ever read after that it was enough 
3033,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,pretty funny engaging fantasy/futuristic novel i especially liked his author s notes at the end about how he struggled to get his more serious work out past tons of editors spoke to me as the husband of an aspiring author and seeing the amount of work one must go through to just get a book published 
3034,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,listened to this story on audio book and well worth a listen if simply for the great narration skills of george guidall i’ve not read much along the fantasy genre but did enjoy this story and look forward to listening to the remaining installations in piers anthony’s incarnations series there was love hate humor and a lot of fun num out of num for me 
3035,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,better than mediocre not pulitzer quality i love the idea of death war fate time and nature being jobs that mortal people do piers anthony is clever and imaginative this series is great if you stop at the first five years after these mr anthony wrote two more about good and evil and they were nowhere near as good as the first 
3036,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,actual rating num num this was so crazy and cool and unique i cannot wait to pick up the second book in this series incredibly clever and fun the only reason this didn t get a higher rating from me is because i didn t really feel attached to any of the characters the plot and world was fantastic but the characters were a tad bit lackluster 
3037,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,the idea of taking over the seat of death is one that has been parodied and expounded by authors as well as television writers this particular scenario is well written although the constant reminders of the main character s past or current feelings towards situations gets rather repetitive skimming over these paragraphs when they occur make a shorter but more interesting read 
3038,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,i first read this book as a junior high student and loved it then in the years that passed the book has become dated its language stilted and some of its themes are sexist the idea for the novel is still brilliant and i will try to re read bearing an hourglass but sometimes the nostalgia of youth doesnt hold 
3039,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,fun idea would have lived to have read this as a teenager i think when all of us are feeling somewhat immortal i actually read the book so i could get a look at the author s notes at the end there was an episode of this american life where a man had found mr anthony s house from various clues in the author s notes and traveled to see him as a teenager 
3040,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,i got this book for free at the library i recognized the author from a book i read num years ago or so i thought i would give this one a try i really loved the sophistication/humor dichotomy in dealing with life and death 
3041,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,an alternate earth where magic is commonplace one drab member of the human race becomes the new incarnation of death by killing his predecessor who had been clumsy he is then thrown into the deep end to learn his new job 
3042,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,zane as death is a compassionate taker of souls he battles with the help of the other incarnations satan for the soul of his love luna his decisions about his office are one of the coolest things about him i wonder if the other books in the series are as good 
3043,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,rereading because a new book was released for the series it s been a while years but this is still one of my favorite series ambitious scope new spin on an old character type and accessible dialogue while still dealing with some profound concepts 
3044,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,still as good as the two or more times i have read this book whole series really since high school loki g forward to the next four in the series and will probably ready the numth and numth despite my recollection of them being not as good as the main five books 
3045,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,a captivating tale full of suspence love and hate and topped of with a twist piers anthony puts in excellent charachters with completely different backgrounds and throws them together into an interesting combo i highly recomend this book to a reader of fiction 
3046,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,1,sexist and annoying i listened to this for a while but mother of gods no thank you maybe at another point in life i ll like it or someone who does like it please explain to me what i m missing to simply listen without any added depth isn t worth my time next 
3047,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,granted i read this as a teenager but it was the best of the incarnations series the series was an interesting one but the stories grew more tiresome as the series went forward 
3048,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,the story was entertaining but what i really enjoyed was the authors note at the end which describes how the author wrote and his experience getting published 
3049,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,review to come
3050,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,finally began the incarnations/immortality series and it is good highly recommended 
3051,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,i m kicking myself for waiting this long to read this 
3053,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,revisiting books of numteenway style often cringey engaging story more entertaining than i thought it would be probably num num stars sorry
3054,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,still just as good as the first time i read it i read it originally in my num s and now in my num s there are awesome nuance s that i missed the first time i read it 
3055,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,as good as i remembered from reading years ago 
3056,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,entertaining read 
3057,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,silly yet unique tale of a man falling into the role of death enjoyable although feels a bit too young adult 
3058,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,1,this book was one element after another that i didn t like when the dragons entered the story it was just too much not finishing this one 
3059,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,if you are like me unsure about the modern pantheon of death god satan and the rest of the incarnations well this will sum it up for you ha its great 
3060,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,a fantastic story of what happens to a feckless man who assumes the mantle of death after he offs the grim reaper 
3061,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,another excellent series by piers anthony although i would rate this book as the standout element in the series an imaginative force of nature 
3062,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,one of my all time favourite books i love this depiction of death a guy just doing his job 
3063,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,i love this book i have yet to finish the entire series but i have read this book over and over again many times over the years 
3064,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,one of my favorites clever ideas throughout the series 
3065,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,1,horribly written i am severely disappointed with everything in this book given to another author this could have been good instead this is just insulting to anyone who reads it 
3066,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,this series overall is really good and this is one of my favorites the second series of books i ever really read piers anthony and the xanth series were my first loves 
3067,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,a very good sifi series nice quick reads and a very interesting storyline piers anthony for me is very hit or miss this one was a great hit very recommended
3068,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,interesting book on the adventures of a man who has to take over deaths duties after he actually kills death 
3069,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,this book was not my favorite but it was really good for what it was intended to be it was really slow and tedious at times and i personally got sick of death s constant inner monologue but the ending made it all worth it i would almost label this as a philosophical book over true scifi/fantasy which after reading the author s note at the end seems to kind of be what he was going for anyway according to him this book is meant to be a satiracle statement on society something i think he
3070,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,i forced my partner to read the handmaid s tale after i read it so he forced me to read this book at first i didn t want to like it because of this it also is in a weird fantasy/sci fi world that i personally have avoided for most of my life that being said i did enjoy this book i found it a weird mixture of soap opera elements swirled up in this story of a man forced into his position as the new death it was interesting to see the differing personalities of each of the incarnations and
3072,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,it was ok it had some little brilliant ideas nestled inside dull writing that kept me reading there is absolutely no subtlety in the events characters or realizations you are beaten over the head with good versus evil satan vs god and the nature of death in such a way that leaves no complexity about them which is perhaps the book s greatest fault i did not like any of the characters except perhaps the horse because he was a talking horse all others are little cardboard cut outs with li
3073,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,1,“my husband left me ” she said grimly “after fifteen years a younger woman i’ll show him ” “isn’t it a sin to commit suicide according to your religion ” he asked she paused frowning “i suppose it is but “ “and should you do such a thing to spite him why match the wrong he did you with a wrong done to yourself ” “i am a woman ” she said with a wry smile “i owe more to emotion than to logic ” zane returned her smile showing that he appreciated her humor no woman really thought herself illogi
3074,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,on a pale horse is a novel about the man who shot death this was the fate of the low life photographer named zane who had to assume the position of death after killing him he has the support of four other incarnations fate time nature war who support him in his new role they teach him what to do and how to complete the job of death all seems to be going well until he receives one special client the woman he loves on a pale horse by piers anthony is the first book in the incarnation o
3075,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,my enjoyment of this book may have been nostalgia based the summer between numth and numth grade we were given a list of books we could read and the one we read would be the basis of the first assignment we had to do upon returning to school in september though it was clearly a way of pre assigning homework for what was meant to be relaxing summer i picked this book mostly because it had a cool grim reaper driving a car on the cover and because it was about death and i was a morbid young man
3076,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,the good on a pale horse has a captivating premise ordinary guy becomes death incarnate and hijinx ensue the prose and dialogue are pretty good for mass market science fiction the bad while the world zane aka death inhabits is interesting the plot he s sent to execute isn t a magician has big plans for zane as does satan said plans seem to emerge out of nowhere about a third of the way through the story once the workaday business of harvesting and classifying souls has run out of nar
3077,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,1,i ve been meaning to read this book for about a decade i finally plucked it off my bookcase and tried to get into it i liked the concept i even like some of the world it is set in i didn t mind some of the description but i just don t like zane at all he s a bit of a male chauvinist but you know what s worse than that a boring male chauvinist seriously the guy just took over death s job and there shouldn t be a reason in the world for me to be bored but i am perhaps this book is jus
3078,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,the author overlays his simplified and somewhat convoluted understanding of catholic doctrine with the personification of five esoteric offices in a fusion of greek mythology and christianity set in a future time although having been written in num anthony’s vision of the future was somewhat like watching the early star trek tv series where the future tools seem antiquated compared to contemporary technology never the less if you grant the author his world view the unfolding of the story all
3079,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,this is my first anthony novel and i have to say that it was interesting i will likely read more of his novels to get a better sense of him as a writer while i enjoyed this story overall my only complaint is that the num of the story that makes up the middle of the story is very episodic as the protagonist just travels from one person to the next taking or not taking their soul it s a bit like watching a tv show like dead like me without the humor for a while it feels a lot like reap of t
3080,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,i would have liked this book a lot better if it had been a collection of short stories featuring death being death i thought the writing was a bit pretentious and anthony’s overuse of the words “proffer” and “bailiwick” made me want to bang my head against the wall while i did enjoy the premise of the story i sometimes couldn’t tell if anthony was trying to be funny and ridiculous or keep his tone serious i felt a little guilty snickering at times i also found the main female to be unlikeab
3081,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,this was an absolutely phenomenal book the characters were all very easy to relate with and the view of death as well as the other incarnations was very refreshing something that i found intriguing outside of the story was piers anthony s author s note in the back i enjoyed listening to this with my num year old he was very entranced by the story and the ideas surrounding it like purgatory and different ideas of how heaven and hell would be it s narrated by george guidall the same person w
3082,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,i picked this up as part of a buddy read i was interested to read piers anthony having heard his name a lot and figured i’d fill this gap in my sf/f reading i planned to read through at least the first few books in the series but after this one i think i’m done and now having read about skeeviness in some of his other writing i have additional reservations keeping me from reading on pros great premise fascinating ideas some interesting exploration of those ideas and a decent plot
3083,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,a good book especially considering the time period in which it was written stylistically it doesn t hold up to the faster pace of today s sci fi but the book overall is an interesting concept and makes you think death and the other typical incarnations time fates etc as a job regular people getting thrust into the roles the ideas on life vs death and heaven vs hell vs purgatory it s an interesting concept to think about anyway i didn t really connect to the story or any of the chara
3084,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,1,i felt like i was reading the results of a high school creative writing assignment one in which the author plumbed the thesaurus regularly to add every obscure word possible in the hopes of adding some headiness to a hopeless novel i was offended on numerous occasions at how poorly it was written and how stilted the interaction between characters i only finished the book out of a sense of duty to the person that recommended the book i couldn t even enjoy it on the level of satisfaction you g
3085,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,num book challenge week num on a pale horse chosen by cassie this book claims to be a fantasy but really it s ethics and philosophy dressed in a fancy coat death has been killed and now his killer must take up the cloak and resume the office as an incarnation the learning curve is steep and the new death seems to have a lot more internal conflicts than previous along the way many facets of life death good and evil are discussed from all kinds of angles as he encounters interesting clients an
3086,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,in num i started keeping a reading list of the books i read i would record the title author year published type of book such as fantasy science fiction fiction or non fiction date finished and a rating of how much i liked the book now in num i still record entries in this same exact journal as soon as i finish a book my journal is one of those marble composition books that can be found in dollar stores these days i would suggest that all readers keep a written list of all the boo
3087,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,1,ok this is the second piers anthony books i ve tried to read in the last month and i think it will probably be the last my question is who hurt you piers there seems to be some latent trust issues with women at play behind the scenes in his books just a quick note in case anyone was still unclear women aren t objects to be traded around like playing cards nor are they sex dispensers for whenever a character does a good deed good lord between this book and a spell for chameleon i have
3088,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,i had been picking up this book to read before i fell asleep and it took me more time to complete since i fell asleep immediately most of the time the plot of the story is interesting enough and kept me hooked but his writing was a bit challenging he throws in some vocabulary which is used in an english test or so i felt like the dialogues were sometimes very unnatural i felt the author is a sexist although all these negative feelings i have quite enjoyed this book my bookish friend g
3089,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,my opinion for this book is very coloured by my experience reading terry pratchett s mort this book had it s own take on death and it took an interesting turn i found terry pratchett s writing to be more consistent that is not to say that piers anthony s writing is bad i just found myself skimming paragraphs because they were boring or between me and the interesting bits i found anthony s world to be intriguing with both magic and science in existence some cases fulfilling the same ro
3090,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,perpetual loser in life zane is about to commit suicide when death comes for him literally panicked instead of turning his gun on himself zane shoots death and kills him now by the rules that govern the incarnations zane becomes death and the afterlife will never be the same i didn t care for this book much i guess i was expecting something more along the lines of anthony s xanth novels which are ridiculously silly and full of puns though not without some depth to them as well i
3091,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,love the story like the writing piers anthony is a weaver of story magic but the text runs on a bit and i found myself tuning out during his extended expositions still the story was enough to keep me going through the entire incarnations of immortality series after reading it many years ago i decided to give it another chance and found that i had to listen to it on audiobook at num num speed the reader s voice is low enough that it doesn t sound like a chipmunk but i could get through the ex
3092,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,liked it didn’t love it the idea of a man killing death i like in the terms of a sci fi fantasy but everything after i think anthony lacks it’s a simple love story with obstacles in the way during the whole book death second guesses himself and questions his acts i believe someone can argue for the other case that at the end he can finally make a decision but give me a break the incarnations plotting satan throwing down his tricks this book does not stick with you you will not remember
3093,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,i heard a great this american life segment featuring piers anthony couple of years back so was curious about his books on a pale horse was written in the early num s and now would be considered ya it s somewhat juvenile but under the surface offers an interesting look at ageism and euthanasia anthony also ends many of his books with quirky author s notes that in and of itself are worth a read if you re an adult and a fan of this genre or have a teenager who s looking for something different
3094,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,the best i can come up with is meh on one hand it was an extremely entertaining world build on the other i didn t really like zane plus the exceedingly sexist male gaze every two or three pages made me shudder literally every few pages there was a moment that shocked me completely out of the story moments where fate calls herself lacking in sex appeal where a professional sports figure gets magically stripped or when a girl is summoned to her father and shows up naked in the end it
3095,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,oh man what cool take on a personalfied version of a supernatural being i absolutely loved this book it was believeable believe it or not when you take something as big as death and try to tie it to mortality it doesn t fly too often but here it definitely did death was cool and conflicted and what a neat way to look at this super being he s larger than life like death should be but not so much so that the reader can t still relate to him this might be one of those rare books i l
3096,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,i actually read this book in high school and was amazed by it because it was like a modern version of the ancient greek myths with a simultaneous modern twist it also posed some deep ethical questions about life death and the nature of good and evil that s deep for a high school book i saw it again just last week as a library discard and literally jumped at the chance to read it again i red in about a week and loved every page except the really corny lines like death shall not be stayed 
3097,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,an exploration of ethics through the role of zane as he adjusts to his new role as death after accidentally murdering his predecessor the idea that death is a bureaucracy has been done to death but was probably really fresh when this book was first published there are some cheesy lines and the plot line changes slightly to where zane s romance becomes the most important element which can get annoying at times also can get sexist at times overall an interesting fantasy i look forward to
3098,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,1,this was recommended to me from a friend when he found out i like to read fantasy i typically try to make it to page num or so before i make my mind up about a book only made it to about num i am not interested or invested at all i would rather close my eyes and rest then open this book to be fair it wasn t badly written i just don t think i like modern fantasy or modern nums fantacy it reminds me a lot of the storm front from dresdin files i didn t like that book either but if you do y
3099,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,what happens if it s your time but you kill somehow kill death instead of the other way around in piers anthony s incarnations of immortality universe the protagonist discovers that he must become the new death anthony spins an easy to read usually quick moving tale of the new death s on the job training assisted by fate time war and nature add to this the practices and policies of purgatory encounters with molly malone of fishmongering fame and a scheme where everyone s soul includ
3100,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,on the plus side the plot shows the author s considerable imagination on the minus side the book seems to be aimed at adults but is written intellectually at the middle school level with a handful of sat words thrown in for spice and the intellectual return on investment is a huge disappointment the book aspires to some philosophical / religious insights but really it s pretty thin gruel the author s juvenile treatment of religion is typical of the casual atheist i really wanted to l
3101,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,amazing read this book just read this book this book is fantastic it s up there among my top five currently and i cannot wait to read the rest of this series the characters were good plot was good story telling was good and i was surprised more than once excellent writing and storytelling at it s finest also i cried and laughed more than once as well p adding to my collection asap 
3102,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,the matchsticks of thought i have referenced this book on any number of occasions without realizing it anyone who reads this book will walk away with more than just an alternate way of looking at the universe they will walk away with a more concrete idea on how to think i return to this book and indeed this entire series every few years to remind myself of how important belief in one self actually is i highly recommend this book 
3103,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,wanted to dip my feet into a bit of sci fi so it goes piers anthonys writing style is not my favorite but i was thoroughly impressed by the creativity surrounding the natural elements of life the book is fast paced and banter straightforward as hell no pun intended i skipped through most of the authors note in the back but ended up memorizing the last paragraph by rereading it so much those last few sentences were impeccable and tied up the book beautifully 
3104,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,1,i was tempted for a moment to give this another star because the concept and the world building were good but at the end of it no this book was consistently sexist and the writing was pretentious at best and clunky at worst i have no problems with the story in and of itself but every time i started to enjoy it i was angered by the way it was told i see what the author was going for and i like what it could have been an awful lot more than i like what it is 
3105,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,new obsession a friend from work suggested this book vehemently to me and we work at walmart how s that for some stereotype dispelling i finally gave in and downloaded it to make my friend happy imagine my thrill at finding a new book series to obsess over and enjoy this book is intelligent funny thought provoking and fun num of num will recommend and strongly as my friend did
3106,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,even though they can stand alone i wish i had read this one first i really enjoy the concept and have fallen in love with the characters if they did have human characteristics i would like eternals to be wise and scrappy i read bearing an hourglass first and the time travel required a little reorientation at one point but still enjoyed the books reading tangled skein now hope to finish the books in the series so far before summer ends 
3107,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,piers anthony tells a great tale of a world where magic and science intersects this is the story of a regular guy that becomes an officeholder of one of the most powerful incarnations death war nature fate time all of the characters play a role in society to keep the world running smoothly its a fascinating take on life this book is great for teens or young adults and adults of all ages a little hit at sex but not out of control 
3108,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,some great ideas when exploring the particular incarnation of a natural force in this case death let down by dated and sloppy writing the veers between shallow wish fulfilment and uncomfortable dated views/sexism mild in the book by my standards but apparently much worse in other works by the author 
3109,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,enjoyable read fun take on the role of death i kind of dislike the narrator listened to the audiobook in my car so that may have made it less enjoyable but at the same time the narrator seemed to fit the protagonist as well i don t know if i ll continue on in the series definitely not anytime soon 
3110,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,zane a guy of middling moral fortitude who s just been tricked into using magic to fritter away any chance of future happiness in his life attempts to shoot himself in the head but when death comes for him personally he freaks out and shoots death right in the face killing him he becomes death satan tries to mess up his job but he perseveres and becomes a good death 
3111,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,the world and plot are well fleshed out with some really interesting social sparring between the immortal characters i would have rated this higher but my enjoyment was spoiled somewhat by the egregious and unnecessary focus on cringe worthy male gaze sections i can only hope that it doesn t come up in the second book 
3112,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,this is one of the few series i own and have owned since i first read it more than a decade ago i decided to reread it but i didn t love this first book as much as i remember it still has an interesting plot and premise but i didn t really like zane there was nothing specific in my dislike i just generally didn t find him an interesting character that i wanted to root for 
3113,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,overall i enjoyed it easy read some interesting concepts and a nice blend of science fiction and fantasy yet as a story went i never really got past my initial dislike of zane and felt he had very little agency in the tale even the resolution felt a little pat anthony s world view and sexism also seemed to distract me it says something when your favorite character was a horse/car 
3114,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,i haven t read this genre in awhile and started this one on my husband s recommendation i really enjoyed the writing style the descriptions provided great imagery and the dialogue presented heavy themes {life death love loss} in an accessible way that encouraged further reflection great read to start off the new year 
3115,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,i kept avidly reading the book and as i got closer to the end i was thinking that there was no way it could have a denouement would it go into two books would i have to go searching for another one whew nope it wraps up with a solid ending a man who becomes death and must defend the woman he loves from satan powerful stuff 
3116,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,of this entire series this has always been my favorite book there is just something about zane and his story that really touched me i know that many times the numst of a series is the best but in this case each book represents a different person and therefore different experiences and duties in this case though i would say that is not the case 
3117,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,the first time i m reading this author and surprise surprise it was published in num this is an outstanding story of death and the work that death carries out i was just fascinated by the imagination and language of the writer and amazing dialogues on delicate but powerful issues that prevail even today i thoroughly enjoyed the book wish a movie would be made of this one 
3118,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5, fiction should always entertain but on another level it is a satiric look at contemporary society with some savagely pointed criticism it is also a serious exploration of man s relation to death piers anthony from the author s note in on a pale horse i loved this book completely and am excited to start book two this book will definitely be a reread 
3119,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,1,i remember enjoying this as a tween but it didn t age well for me it is immature intentionally silly and very fixated on the female form the mixture of comedy and existential ideas just didn t come off well for me 
3120,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,1,it had some really interesting ideas at play and i appreciate that he attempted to tackle some socio political issues within the text but it just didn t work for me the writing was okay but the characters were absolutely one note full review to come
3121,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,enjoyed reading this as a kid probably around num some themes were a little edgy and some of the sexual components in this book were disturbingly weird but the writing was decent and the story idea itself was very cool 
3122,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,1,i think the target audience for this novel is a num year old boy i found the plot to be inexplicable illogical and corny but what i found truly disgusting was the objectification of women from beginning to end 
3123,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,another one that i gave up on i m just having so much trouble staying invested in the story and the main character the audiobook reader also leaves much to be desired great concept lackluster execution only read if a good concept alone can keep you enthralled 
3124,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,a very original story that gives you a glance into the profession of the in this case not so grim reaper a story that i had to warm up to a bit but then took me away unexpectedly the writer combined magic and technology in a way that works 
3125,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,i have always enjoyed piers anthony s books but i had never read this series as a whole i quite enjoyed this series of books i found the characters and story to be clever and interesting it sort of reminded me of a more adult version of a rick riordan series of books 
3126,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,num num/num the main character zane makes some really stupid decisions that ruin the plot near the end the world building is pretty cool i really enjoyed the blend of magic and science in normal everyday life 
3127,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,an interesting series the author treats with some serious issues in a jocular manner this author is great at creating believable worlds i sometimes run out of money by the fifth book i don t consider puns to be all that humerous 
3128,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,a friend of mine told me to read this over num years ago so it s been sitting on my to read list that long wish i had read it way back then it s nice to know that piers anthony still holds up twenty odd years later 
3129,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,this was a very intersting sort of book i really enjoyed it actually because zane s struggle with his feelings and choices were very realistic and human despite him being the grim reaper overall a very good book that i ll probably read again in the future 
3130,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,i found the main character zane a bit too whiny at times the hang ups he has seem to be totally outlandish other than that loved the book and have gone through num already also my bf who is more a scifi guy is love this and series as well 
3131,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,such an unusual but funny and thought provoking book 
3132,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,1,dnf numst chapter good writing/concept could not engage me enough to get past dated/sexist 
3133,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,i haven t read piers anthony in many years this was a well thought out story enjoyable and thought provoking probably num num stars if it would let me do a half a star 
3134,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,a good story about death s life 
3135,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,fantastic series the kind of books i immediately wish i had thought of first 
3136,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,loved this series on its first release planning to reread 
3137,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,this book was disappointing great potential that doesn t deliver while the book is partially about collecting souls it lacks one itself cheesy 
3138,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,loved as a preteen looking forward to reading again 
3139,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,just as good the numth time as it was the first enjoyable series that i am highly looking forward to reading again 
3140,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,3,easy to put down but also easy to pick up savvy 
3141,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,this book helped me through my grieving process better than any books i read that were actually meant for that purpose 
3142,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,this is my favorite fantasy series 
3143,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,while i really enjoyed the creativity of this fantasy novel and felt they story was fun the sexism is just downright comically bad it s really hard to get past such a ridiculous view of women 
3145,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,2,disappointing repetitive meh 
3146,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,a well written book enjoyed reading it 
3147,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,i love this book i am glad i have the entire series at my fingertips to read it again 
3148,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,good fun a great start to the series 
3149,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,back to the late nums for this one not a bad story line but haven t read for years 
3150,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,as fun and interesting as i remember it 
3151,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,a well written book enjoyed reading it 
3152,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,really enjoyed this story looking forward to reading more in the series 
3153,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,4,i really enjoyed this series and i loved this book in particular it s one of my favorites in the series 
3154,On a Pale Horse,Piers Anthony,5,rereading this series as my lovely mother replaced my missing collection as a birthday gift wonderful framework engaging characters clever and highly snackable 
3155,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,2,i wanted so badly to like this book it has so much going for it it is original and inventive i never once caught myself thinking now where did i read that before oh right in the last three books the idea of the graced their skills and their mismatched eyes of the seven kingdoms of the characters themselves all of them were uniquely cashore s own her prose was clear and lucid though there were passages that dragged and made me want to skip ahead so pacing was occasionally a pro
3156,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,graceling by kristin cashore follows in a burgeoning market for strong female characters katsa is much like katniss from the hunger games in her naive perception of the world her coldness and tendency towards pragmatic practicality she is similar to xhex from the black dagger brotherhood in her disgust of all things feminine the story is well written with engaging fun characters katsa is fun to read about the plot may be a little predictable at times but it did throw me a curve ball tow
3157,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,1,graceling has a beautiful cover great premise and lots of hype and would be a terrific novel if it weren’t for the writing and atrocious main character what is with the awkward sentence structures and prose in this book in these dungeons the darkess was complete but katsa had a map in her mind it should be in these dungeons the darkness was complete but katsa had a map in her mind and look at the next sentence one that had so far proven to be correct as oll s maps tended to do 
3158,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,when a monster stopped behaving like a monster did it stop being a monster did it become something else authors take note this is ya lit done right katsa is a monster she s been one ever since she discovered the power of her killing grace only she starts to wonder does she have to be in the graceling realm those born with heterochromia different colored eyes are blessed with a grace a grace can be anything from the mundane i e holding your breath indefinitely to the cruel i 
3159,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,3,first thing i need to point out is that i consider myself a feminist even as far as to take an active role is such matters previously i have written articles on feministing and i honestly think so many of these issues are still very important in today s world however you look at it the battle for equality has not been won and has in fact become rather dormant on that note i love reading fiction by feminist writers atwood never fails to deliver and the handmaid s tale is one of my favou
3160,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,2,what i think about when i hear the name po po the panda po from telletubbies a crazy guy like edgar allen poe poo katsa ketchup mutant katniss ror roar i m a t rex tealiff tea leaf skye skype a modern name which you will not find in a medieval place king randa ranting panda king ranting panda drowden drowsy drowning thigpen pig pen thinking pen leck lick peck neck smack some other variation lienid an insult hey you lienid by the way po s real name is green
3161,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,2,updated num/num/num i happen to like books which feature kick ass feminist heroines and are light on the romance so i should like this book right yeah but i don t first of all katsa acts like a petulant little girl throughout the entire book not some strong feminist poster woman katsa shows very little if any personal growth over the course of this novel also i felt like the author spent too much time trying to sell us on the following ideas femininity is an idea forced upon women by t
3162,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,it is so hard to write reviews for books i actually like no love talking about this book is like trying to describe to someone a relationship from long ago that was bittersweet and is now over but i have never had a relationship that involved so many horses and swordplay not even metaphorically and fewer people care about my love life than about this book i see you ariel you are glowering at me with tiny slitted eyes but this book is like a wonderfully sweet relationship at the beginni
3163,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,okay so this was a re read on audio and i thought it was really cool with the multiple narrators and music and stuff but sometimes one of the voices rubbed me the wrong way and the music went from fantasy to what sounded like western music lol maybe it was just me i still loved the book though i am in love with katsa she is an awesome inspiration for women warriors in a book she kicks arse and takes names i love the fact that she doesn t care anything about marriage or having kids sh
3164,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,when a monster stopped behaving like a monster did it stop being a monster did it become something else so fun fact this is probably one of my most reread books of all time and it was such a big influence on both what i write and what i love to read and i love and appreciate it more every time and i’d love if you all could appreciate it too along with me this book opens with a scene in which katsa a character graced with the skill to kill people literally actually murder them pu
3165,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,update num/num/num i probably should already stop being surprised by the fact that every time i reread a book i come up with something new to say or feel about it looks like my previous reading of graceling caused a lengthy rant yeah no such strong feelings this time this time i was able to appreciate the writing more it s lovely i really love how it flows how the sentences connect this book stands the test of time and it s great that it stirs so much discussion and often outrage 
3166,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,num stars overview “when a monster stopped behaving like a monster did it stop being a monster did it become something else ” i honestly didn’t know anything about this but i d seen it around and finally it was recommended enough i was really surprised by the depth of this story and the characters the story revolves around katsa who lives in a world where people can be born with a ‘grace ’ meaning aside from two different eye colors they have an exceptional skill katsa’s grace is killin
3167,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,loved it except for the raging feminist agenda note since these two brief flippant sentences have gotten so many trolls over the years i ll just add that i support the book s feminist ideals num what i do not like is the way we re hammered over the head with the message the raging part if you will it s inelegant tiresome soapboxing that managed to annoy someone who actually agrees with the principles so i don t know how it s going to persuade anyone who does not katsa s views als
3168,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,3,num num stars soooo i thought this was some kind of hunger games type dystopian story about a girl who could kill with her touch for some reason and put off reading it because i wasn t huge on shatter me but then this turned out to be full of castles and princes and everything i love so that was a fun surprise i m extremely neutral about this book though there were a few elements i liked mostly the castles and princes but the worldbuilding was weak and the writing itself was really dull i di
3169,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,gah sooo good okay i read some of the other reviews and now i feel the need to defend this book basically i think it s completely hilarious how many people are shocked and appalled that num there is sex in this book and num the heroine does not desire to get married or have children guess what young adults do have sex and the idea that it s not love if you don t want to marry them or that you shouldn t have sex until you re married is why all the poor children in your congregation are ma
3170,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,3,[this is a review of an advance copy ] while cashore shows herself to be a promising writer in many respects this book could have used a better editing job especially with the pacing the climax and the dénouement other points num the dialogue she put in the ten year old princess s mouth was not believable in the slightest maybe cashore should spend some time around pre adolescent girls to get an idea of what they really talk like num the psychology of several of the characters including kats
3171,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,1,this was pretty much one of the most irritating books of all time and consistent with my idea of ya fantasy but i fought my way through it because goshdarnit i picked it up at the library dragged it home with a load of other books and groceries and renewed it the max number of times i was gonna finish it you know the kickbutt heroine who is just totally kickbutt and doesn t need no one no way no how and yet loves and feels and hurts deeply and yet keeps everyone away because she is b

3173,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,wrensreads review if you know anything about me you’ll know that shannon hale and gail carson levine are two authors that have dreamed up books that made a handprint on my childhood they are lively and they are uplifting and they shine girls in a light that the media and history turn a blind eye to well now i am going to add kristin cashmore to that list she writes exactly like those two ladies mentioned about but for a slightly older age group she grasps the fairytale feel by the hand and
3174,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,let s get this done my dinner is getting cold and i have dreams to crush ready andiamo boom num katsa while i love the author s intent for empowerment with katsa she was a bit too much of a special snowflake for me i will forever fist pump to her unstoppable strength as a warrior a woman and a person but at the end of the day she was highly unrealistic and too much of a caricature for me she s kind of a double edged sword in terms of her feminist appeal too instead of helping the women
3175,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,3,my teenage daughter brought this home from the library and didn t get to it soon enough so i swiped it from her and read it in one day it was a fun read for the most part and certainly kept my attention i found myself making excuses to my visiting relatives in the evening so i could hole up in my bedroom and finish this novel in peace in my defense it was num num pm and they d been talking my ears off for two hours that said i have some qualms about recommending this book a lot has been sa

3177,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,2,hm the hardest thing about this book is that it could have been so good i started out loving everything about it and ready to recommend it to everyone but then it started reading like a feminist/anti marriage/anti kids campaign platform okay that might be a little much but you started to feel that the author had an agenda it was just really disappointing because i loved the characters so much oh well also even though it s considered a ya novel there is sex in it pretty disappoint
3178,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,3,i really enjoyed the history and mainly the amazing kingdom that the writer has created i know that many will believe it is something unfair my punctuation and i respect that because this series has a lot of fans but i have not felt comfortable with the idea of putting more because i liked but i haven t loved as i thought it would “i m not going to wear a red dress she said it would look stunning my lady she called she spoke to the bubbles gathered on the surface of the water if ther

3180,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,for the most parts i loved this book i liked how it starts off with a rescue mission so there was no slow start so this book is about a graced girl called katsa being graced means you are born with a specific skill that you are great at they are recognized by their eyes which are two different colours katsa is a graced killer or so she thinks and she meets a guy called po who is also graced together they try to uncover the mystery behind the kidnap of po s grandfather i enjoyed the

3206,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,3,graceling has the right twists in the right places some great characters two of which make for a uniquely interesting love story and an awesome world what kristin cashore does with graces puts a fresh spin on superpowers and she uses those perfectly to create really interesting character dynamics especially a love story unfortunately for how good everything else was the plot seems like an afterthought and it really makes it hard to get into all the other great things graceling has go

3210,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,this is a fantastic ya fantasy story i would recommend it to anyone that loves the genre and especially to people that loved twilight or even people that didn t because the relationship was so unhealthy and obsessive you ll find none of that here this is a book where the girl is the strongest character and everyone around her knows it shes had to live her life watching people avoid her and having to do her uncle the king s bidding all because she was born with a grace for killing that

3215,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,i really enjoyed this book and thought it was a little different to many of the ya books out there of this type katsa and po were charming together they were likeable protagonists and the resolution to the story was unconventional or at least not what i expected i can t say too much without it being a spoiler but i will say there was one event that i was glad did not happen when i thought it might the realm of the gracelings was well portrayed well worth a read 
3216,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,i have no idea why i haven t picked up this book before i love the characters they re so unique and interesting the main character katsa is definitely one of my favorite heroine s of all time she s such a strong character the only little problem i had with this book was how katsa and po got together not that i don t like them together which i do but it felt a little too sudden this was a great book to start off the year

3218,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,3,“how absurd it was that in all seven kingdoms the weakest and most vulnerable of people—girls women—went unarmed and were taught nothing of fighting while the strong were trained to the highest reaches of their skill ” i completely agree that girls should have been taught self defense and self sufficiency this also applies to our society girls need to learn self defense first of all i think po is kind of a silly name for a young handsome vigorous prince who is pretty dreamy po s name
3219,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,every now and then i venture into the so called ‘young adult’ literature realm and each time i’m surprised by how we completely redefined what constitutes the acceptable reading material for this age group and i don’t mean it in a bad way not at all in fact i’m excited over the sheer volume of stuff for teenagers that gets published these days it might be because i grew up in the post communist poland but i’m sure the choice was nowhere near as broad additionally the books the librarians

3226,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,firstly how have i gone for so long without this book in my life secondly this is how you build a believable romance around a multifaceted plot rather than it becoming the only or dominating feature and thirdly all those naysayers who believe epic high fantasy can t be built within the confines of the ya genre clearly haven t read this book

3232,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,3,three star books are often the most difficult to write reviews for because they re books that didn t completely work for me and yet i still enjoyed them overall graceling is one of those books i ll start by saying that when it comes to high fantasy i tend to prefer political intrigue over adventure stories and while graceling is a mix of both it definitely leans more heavily on the latter the long stretches of time spent traveling were a bit tedious for me those who love adventure fantasy s
3233,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,1,well i can see why people complain about ya this one feels like it was written by a num year old it starts out rather promising but then it just turns into a tourist and survival guide of the forests and mountains sort of book nothing happens just traveling there s no real story arc the blurb on the book doesn t factor in until the second half then the ending is incredibly anti climactic i had a few problems with katsa she is horrified of being tied down to someone in marriage but d
3234,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,3,graceling graceling realm num by kristin cashore is a book i had mixed feelings about i loved the idea of having these skills or grace the first couple of chapters had me very interested but then it started leaving me flat i like the premise of the story the potential and some of the characters i just found that it didn t have something that made me want to get deep into this world it was an okay read but i doubt i will follow the series i got this book from the library

3236,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,this review appears on happy indulgence check it out for more reviews graceling is strong on feminism values with a heroine that refuses to wear dresses and look pretty who is powerless to change her own situation and while this is applied with a heavy hand at times i appreciated this female empowerment if there’s anyone that could be defined as kick ass it would be katsa she’s blessed with the grace of killing ready to cause death on anyone in a single touch i absolutely adored katsa

3238,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,2,this one has been getting a lot of praise but it didn t do much for me although i liked the premise––a strong heroine with a moral dilemma danger and intrigue ––and the first scene drew me in i was disappointed by the execution the world felt unimaginative and barely sketched out to the point that the names of five out of seven kingdoms are thinly disguised versions of north south east west and middle the plot was thin and most of the characters flat the some people have special po

3242,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,this book was amazinggggg i loved how powerful katsa felt but that she still allowed herself to be vulnerable at times and really realized her own strength and abilities with time the romance was great but didn t overpower the story or make katsa make dumb decisions but po oh po i loved him from the very beginning the mystery was awesome when everything comes together you re like oh my gosh this book is the s i loved it from beginning to end and best of all no cliffhanger

3246,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,tamora pierce blurbs this book saying here s a wow of a book and that sums up my feelings pretty well kristin cashore has created an intensely interesting world and peopled it with characters that sparkle with complexity and life the terms fast paced and compulsively readable can t be used often enough here there are moments in the plot that literally made me gasp out loud but the core of the book is the naturallly evolving development of the characters who take control of the reader s he

3250,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,2,num num stars vanilla and num that s my review of this book view spoiler [ despite being a fantasy book for some reason graceling read very different from the recent ya fantasy books i ve been reading there s a hollowness in the world building i never connected with the characters and their troubles and some of the message this book tried to cut across was done quite crudely some of the recent books that i ve read from this genre rely on some level of familiarity in setting the foundations of

3252,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,3,num num po katsa stars i was pleasantly surprised by the world kristin cashore wrote the kingdoms the graceling system the characters for sure it has great potential and i will be reading further books in the series yet some of my reading necessities weren t accomplished with this book curiously i do think that maybe this exact same thing that lowers my rating are the ones that increased it for other people the novel dives right into the action there is not a subtle warning or a littl
3253,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,2,get ready for a bloody review if you re a fangirl or fanboy of graceling i warn you to stay away before i make you cry with hatred for me i picked up this book with the expectations of either hating it or loving it and i came to the conclusion that graceling doesn t deserve either my love or hatred it deserves to bleed like the disappointment bleeding through its pages close enough if there s anyone i wish to stun at dinner i ll hit him in the face so much hitting so much crying like se
3254,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,i have to say that i loved this book once i started reading i could barely put it down the characters were fun and real or as real as they could be in a world where extraordinary and almost supernatural talents are maybe a little less than common but not unusual this is definitely fantasy and the characters were fantastic but still realistic katsa was such a wonderful character graced with the ability to fight and kill with ease she is used as a weapon and royal leg breaker by the kin
3255,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,graceling the first book in the seven kingdoms trilogy is a refined and adventurous read with an unforgettable heroine from the first page i loved graceling i loved the sophisticated prose that somehow managed to be beautifully written but still ‘easy reading’ i loved katsa a protagonist with grit and compassion and i loved the seamlessly written action that urged me to turn page after page kristin cashore is an addictive voice and i followed it willingly buying fire the second novel i
3256,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,this is the book along with its companion fire that got me interested in high fantasies which is my favorite genre and in reading in general i don t know how my love for reading would have been like without this book i remember how i found it in a barnes noble and begged my parents to buy it for me i remember reading about this amazing world where they are people called gracelings and how one young woman in particular believed too much in the image other people had created for her k
3257,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,3,i liked this i can t say i was totally in love with it though it started off slow if my bff hadn t wanted me to stick with it i don t know if i would have luckily it picked up and i was totally caught up in the adventures of the lady katsa and prince po its a good read the whole graceling thing was actually really interesting and once it picked up after the beginning i got through it quickly that being said i should up the rating but as interesting as i thought it was i ve read s

3262,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,my all time favorite reviewer was roger ebert i learned a lot from checking out his movie reviews you can like different sorts of stories for different reasons you should not use a one size fits all standard but adapt your style to the sort of tale you are reviewing as in don t judge an action movie like mad max the same way as an introspective ingmar bergman drama most importantly when you decide on a rating make it personal did i enjoy it or not did i learn anything useful or did

3264,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,1,this book is a very good example of how the fantasy genre has become irretrievably polluted by stephanie meyerism i ve read three chapters so far and have no desire to read any more for three reasons you could also call them three good pieces of advice for young fantasy writers num if you re going to write about fighting take a martial arts class or at least talk to someone who has you ll avoid writing idiotic sentences like she ducked under his blade and whirled her foot out clipping

3269,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,3,this book is everywhere i always see it in bookstores and see reviews about it which is what led me to begin reading the series yes i know i am many years late this book started well there was potential but it was quite obvious i was reading a book that was written many years ago for an age group a bit younger than myself i’ll keep this short but what annoyed me the most was the ending like most readers i expect a big finale and while the story began to build up and the conclusion b

3272,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,3,num num stars i am kind of torn on this book there were things i liked a lot and then there were things that were very ‘meh’ characters katsa was a pretty strong character she kicked ass and was firm in her resolve this being said she was a little too good at everything i understand why but it did lend an implausible air to some of what was going on in the story po was also a very likable character but again he was too good he differed from katsa’s goodness in that it wasn’t necessarily s
3273,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,if it hadn’t been for a friend on goodreads giving me the extra encouragement to give graceling a try i’m sure that i wouldn’t have picked up this wonderful series for some time despite me only have read a few fantasy books i could probably tick them off on one hand i have to say graceling is a brilliant example of exactly how a fantasy novel should be done now i’m no expert on this but cashore creates a wonderful world that’s truly believable but doesn’t once overwhelm you with the deta
3274,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,rather enjoyed this fantasy it has a lot of the usual tropes of the genre but cashore s writing style and the compelling plot engaged my interest and i ended up reading this non stop wanting to find out what was going to happen isn t it always the case the whole notion of gracelings is again not a new one but it works and the author gives us a nice cast if a little stereotyped bitterblue was especially likeable in her determination and of course the main two protagonists katsa is the
3276,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,there are so many wonderful things about this book first of all i love the world and the concept of gracelings it is so refreshing to come across someone with new ideas and of course the female lead katsa is so utterly kick butt i love how she can even out fight po the male lead and he is ok with that the first part was awesome when katsa still didnt know what his grace was and he kept giving her funny little looks that she couldnt decipher it made him so mysterious not that po wasn
3277,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,brilliant superb the best fantasy ya book i ve ever read cashore is a gifted writer indeed i love everything about this book the characters the setting the plot and the uniqueness of it for me it s like a combination of fantasy and historical romance a total package of a wonderful book at first i was hesitant to read it the first three pages had me confused i couldn t get into it i had to adjust with the language used because it has been a long time since i ve read books like it 
3278,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,2,this was such a big disappointment i expected better but i only something really boring that just dragged for me i actually don t have a problem with katsa she is great po fell flat and well i dnfed it a little over num the plot is the main aspect that made me rate this so low i think the plot was really weak the world created is unique but the plot is very much off point and boring i can t just read the hunger games if i want to read about survival oh and before i forget po is just so pr
3279,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,2,i enjoyed the premise of this book it had some action packed scenes as well as some tasteful romance throughout but let s get real the only reason i finished this book was because of prince po i did not enjoy katsa s personality whatsoever the only thing i liked about her was her name my major complaint is the stigma cashore tends to put on marriage throughout the entire book okay now let me elaborate on the above noted complaint throughout this whole book it is implied that if you get m
3280,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,i ve totally fallen in love with the characters in graceling katsa is a graced fighter tougher and stronger than any man but with a great heart she doesn t even know she has po is a gentleman warrior sweet romantic and a great match for katsa bitterblue is a ten year old princess who s been through some terrible times yet she perseveres actually i almost got to love her as much as katsa and po maybe even more there are other wonderful characters raffin oll skye helda and the vil
3281,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,i just this book is soooo perfect i did not expect to love it so much the second time around but the magic is still there it has a unique approach to the genre to relationships and to characters at times katsa can come across as somewhat simplistic single minded but that i think is part of her character not necessarily a design flaw this book definitely remains in my pantheon of my favorite books ever 
3282,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,not what i was expecting but thoroughly surprised by how much i liked it definitely an action book with a strong alost masculine leading heroine it s a book you would pick up if you want adventure 
3283,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,3,i … i don t really know yet how i feel about this book maybe i ll know by the end of the review first things first graceling is the first book in a ya fantasy trilogy the two other books are apparently set in the same world but each of the books are able to stand on their own this world is divided into seven kingdoms all of them ruled by more or less useless and power hungry kings who care more about their own power and fortune than their people to combat that the so called council was fo
3284,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,i have finally read this book again eee i cannot believe i let it go more than three years before i did this graceling have been my favorite for years i was a bit nervous about reading it again this time for the fifth time as i worried that i wouldn t love it as much as i did years before i shouldn t have worried it is the best book graceling is still my favorite book the characters are beyond amazing and i love this romance more than i can say this book still made me cry even though
3285,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,1,after gathering my thoughts and speaking to a friend who also read this book i think it s time i put our feelings into this review seriously clara when are you going to get an account my first point has nothing to do with the book but kristin cashore s last name reminds me of cashews that is all the writing and prose itself is so awful did cashew s editor read it and think that sentence only makes sense if you reread it a couple of times and she s missing a few commas very tolkein i like

3328,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,2,i am truly surprised by opinion on this one this was one of the few books by an author i ve never read before that i didn t approach with caution that i truly expected to enjoy after all there were countless positive reviews both from my friends and the goodreads community in general but i m really wondering whether or not we read the same book my first problem with the book came right off the bat actually my first two problems but i ll get to the second one later the first one came
3329,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,num num stars i think starting the year with this book well i regret nothing i haven’t read high fantasy in ages and i haven’t read on my kindle even longer than that and i believe making both of those changes now really helped me out of my ongoing reading slump i’ve actually finished a book in less than two days and a long book at that i’m so happy about this it’s ridiculous graceling has everything i want in a high fantasy book great world building lots of fun adventures amazing c
3330,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4, this review is filled with minor plot spoilers here and there i feel so relieved that i finally finished this book it had been collecting dust on my shelf for over four years which is unacceptable i was actually very reluctant to pick it up after reading some very negative reviews about it i’m sorry but i’m gonna be ranting about this at the very end of the review so i won’t be upset if you ignore it haha i honestly just need to learn to make my own opinions because i was surprised by how
3331,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,the best part of this book was po like by far i love him so much to be honest it was almost a num star read for me because the writing style was terribly inconsistent sometimes it read very fluent and easily and sometimes it read like the worst fanfic on the interwebs like how was there no editor sometimes it switched on the middle of a page and you were completely ripped out of the reading pleasure and had to push through these party also katsa the protagonist definitely has an undiag
3332,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,oh my god this was amazing it s been a long while since i ve sobbed for so long and hard throughout a book i just can t review coming soon 
3333,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,2,as seen on zombie mommies maybe my expectations were too high maybe i thought the story would center on the adventures of a female james bond instead all i got was a bad taste in my mouth it s not that graceling was so poorly written i actually found the writing style and world building nicely done it s just that i think i was lied to first cashore refers to graceling as growing from her daydreams about a girl who possesses extrodinary powers and who forms a friendship with a boy wi
3334,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,fantasy is a new genre for me to read i loved poison study so i have been trying more books from the fantasy section and enjoying them this book was loved by everyone i know and i can see why it is such a wonderfully imaginative story that weaves together a beautiful world with multi dimensional characters katsa is the niece of king who is kind of a jerk and since she is graced with the power of amazing fighting skills the jerk king uses her as his thug to go out and break legs or chop
3335,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,★★★★ stars an exceptional young adult fantasy book there is plenty to like here with a beta hero to die for enough insight into real life to keep me interested and a few nice twists to keep the surprise going i also think it is perfect as a buddy read which is how i read it update num/num/num view spoiler [ wow i didn’t realize this book was so controversial i have read some of the reviews and comments and all i can say is that i do agree with the “double standard” issue in that if it
3336,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,one thing i really like about this book is that it s part fantasy/part romance but the romance doesn t derail the mc s quest yes katsa falls in love and it was never her plan but she doesn t just throw away everything else she had planned because she falls in love katsa insists she never wants to get married she doesn t want to be anyone s wife and she doesn t want to compromise her own desires for any man i love this story because she does not change her mind in the end although she adm
3337,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,3,this book was hard for me i think my expectations were just too high i loved the premise of the book and the concept of graces i felt that there was confusion by the author though the actual writing was at a fairly low level geared towards a much younger audience than much of the content meshed up with for me i felt as though this idea could have been done in a much better way it felt like it was lacking polish for me i did really enjoy the characters but i couldn t feel much emotion be
3338,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,3,graceling is a reread for me but one that still managed to be better than i expected it was a sensation in the teen library group i was a part of in high school in no small part because cashore’s protagonist katsa is a sharp contrast to bella swan it wasn’t until years later long after i had read both graceling and its companion fire that i encountered criticism of katsa as a strong female character whose strength derives from being as masculine as possible returning to the series with
3339,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,i m not gonna lie i had some problems with the first half i felt like themes were being thrown at me from every which way katsa sigh girl i understand you re going through a lot but damn way to think the world revolves around you but then it hit the second half and i really enjoyed it it became a real fantasy adventure story katsa was better suited as a protector figure instead of a self absorbed girl against the world it re instated my faith in cashore i read and lov
3340,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,this was a pretty good read about a girl named katsa who is a graceling someone who has an extraordinary talent and hers is killing so she is forced to kill as the king s thug things change when she meets prince po who is also a graceling can she help him save the kingdom from evil read on and find out for yourself this is the first of a series and was a pretty good read i enjoyed checking it out and hope to one day finish the rest of this series soon if you like fantasy action series chec
3341,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,i loved this book it was so very well written i was on the edge of my seat from the very first page i loved the characters especially katsa and po i also liked bitterblue they were well written and were so very likable i loved the story it progressed at a steady and even pace it was action packed and i loved everything about this book will be continuing this series soon so overall i really enjoyed this book and will read more of this series 
3342,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,simply epic 
3343,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,2,so… that was a book with the exception of katsa’s relationship with po and even that was problematic to some degree i don’t think this book has much going for it the story is okay and the villain had potential but everything else was a disaster in a world where a small number of children develop a special ability i e a superpower i e the x men trope once again katsa is graced with “killing ” her uncle the king uses her as a thug to punish the usually innocent people who cross h
3344,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,my sister has wanted me to read this book for quite some time now multiple times i ve picked it up and put it back down for one reason or another this time i sat down and actually read this and all i have to say is i m very disappointed in myself for not reading this sooner i m not sure how to put my love for this book into words there were powers and squabbling kingdoms cashore made this a magical read all the characters were so wonderful and the romance i actually liked the romance i
3345,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,what the heck this book is so perfect it hurts rtc when i’m not so happy but mad but sad but confused but dead
3346,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,2, rubs temples i did enjoy this book when it wasn t focusing on katsa i enjoyed the world the idea of the graced etc i loved bitterblue to death and skye and po loved it ohhhh but did i hate katsa i already know about the feminist debate and honestly all i have to say is is that i do not enjoy someone s beliefs shoved down my throat and that is what i felt happening whenever cashore mentioned marriage children and sex i respect your decisions if you do not wish to be married/hav
3347,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,this book was recommended by a classmate of my english num class who was kind enough to guide me through the class itself and through the library it was big at the beginning of my exchange year in the usa she recommended it to me because i liked the hunger games trilogy again those books just opened the door for so many others i was expecting a strong princess killing romance etc and indeed there was all of that but not the way i thought the world let s see the story takes place in a
3348,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,also posted on my blog rinn reads oh graceling what a total and unexpected joy you were from the very first page with a thrilling opening scene i loved this book so much more than i thought i would we learn that in this world some people are born with graces great skills that vary from person to person some rather useless and some incredibly useful these people stand out from others by their different coloured eyes and are actually shunned or rather feared for their abilities the m
3349,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,3,the feelings of meh are quite strong with this one rtc buddy read with kat emelia \ /
3350,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,audiobook review a fantastic action filled book that kept me gasping and screaming inside throughout the entire audiobook experience emma powell may sound a little monotonous when the story commences but at the end do i only love her voice and how she manages to switch to each character s voice flawlessly i will definitely be buying the audiobook of fire to hear her lovely narration once again to be one hundred percent honest i ve picked this book up at least num times from the library in at
3351,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4,i’ve read graceling before and i wasn’t quite sure what to think of it then the anti marriage plot and katsa’s rejections of femininity didn’t sit well with me then not because i’m that vociferously pro marriage or that insistent on anyone being feminine but i think i was looking for someone more like celaena back then someone who could fight and survive and still be a woman and not view feminine pursuits or interests as weak katsa isn’t that at all she’s a woman who has been mostly forc
3352,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,2,i was sucked into the story right from the start and at the end of each chapter i wanted to keep reading to find out what would happen next although our main hero “po” was stuck with a kind of lame name i still found myself totally liking him the chemistry between him and katsa was fantastic at least in the beginning i liked katsa’s character i felt bad that she was graced with killing and had to perform some pretty horrible things as a young girl but now at eighteen she finally stands o
3354,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,4, source i own a copy of this book katsa lives in a world where some people develop a special talent called a ‘grace’ these people are marked by having two different colour eyes and katsa herself has a very unique gift – the grace of killing if katsa intends to kill someone she can do it without weapons even barehanded against many trained swordsmen katsa has also started a special council though that works for the good of the people and her latest endeavour has been to save a very impor
3355,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,so i finally jumped on the graceling bandwagon and honestly people if one of you had just beat me over the head with this book num years ago and told me that the series was full of complete stories that didn’t depend on one another i would have read it a long time ago clearly this is all your fault but i’m willing to forgive and forget because i loved graceling this book swept me away as only fantastic fantasy can do compelling me to neglect every other aspect of my life until i’d read the
3356,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,1,i just remembered to add this book on the list of the books i ve read it s been a while since i read it too and i can t understand how i could possibly forget graceling because it is so bad it really stands out the saddest thing about it being horrible is that this book had a huge potential the idea of graces was amazing the seven kingdoms katsa s unusual eyes what ruined it all though was the main character katsa it was obvious she was supposed to be a strong female character the
3357,Graceling,Kristin Cashore,5,what a good freaking book i can already tell this is a series i will cherish and wish i had purchased in hardback some series own me and this is bound to be one of them the world is so unique mad props to kristin cashore the seven kingdoms were each so different both politically and culturally the idea of a graceling is brilliant it was so interesting to watch these characters come to terms with the true definition of their grace as they learned its purpose and how to use it katsa was a
3358,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,i shall write a real review but right now i can only think of one way this book could be any better 
3359,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,all the stars final review first posted on fantasy literature peter s beagle’s classic the last unicorn turns fifty years old this year and it’s remained in the public eye and continues to capture hearts like very few fantasies of its age like a fine tapestry this gorgeous fairy tale weaves together unicorns and harpies wizards and witches dark hearted kings and brave heroes its lyrical language is embellished with whimsical humor and given heft by bittersweet life lessons a shy unicorn
3360,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,it s a real shame that as i was giving this book five stars i could hear in my head some of the many people whose opinions i don t ask for going oh that tara she s so spacey and mock able ha if they saw it and then i think well let s be sweet anyway so last night my dad and i were watching the jimmy carter documentary and were all oh he is so awesome then the dvd player started acting up i grabbed another disc and put it in to see where the problem lay and the dvd was the last u
3362,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,i ll get straight to the point on this read it read it now the last unicorn num is a classic and not without reason the third person narrative centers on a unicorn who believing she is the last of her kind in the world sets off on a journey to discover what has happened to the others she encounters a host of diverse characters as her journey progresses each of them bringing her closer to her goal wikipedia i thought i d do this review a bit different than my normal routine and just l
3363,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,3,so i set the mood for rereading the last unicorn by putting together a nifty mix of woodstock era classics heavily featuring the likes of jethro tull canned heat richie havens a lot of early pink floyd i put on my comfy clothes i brewed some tea i picked my sunniest room and my cat sensing my mood snuggled in close however i did not smoke any weed perhaps this was my mistake nonetheless the mood was definitely set and the enjoyment swiftly commenced this is a nice
3364,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,“we are not always what we seem and hardly ever what we dream ” in my mind the movie the last unicorn will forever be known as the first and so far only book movie or tv show to ever give me nightmares i think i saw the film for the first time when i was about num or num and i remember being completely entranced by it it immediately became one of my favourite movies despite the fact that i couldn’t sleep for a week after seeing it for the first time i never realised it was originally a novel
3365,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,this unicorn along with ende s neverending story and zindell s requiem for homo sapiens has made me what i am it has been there for me to shine and shiver with its seashell light even in the deepest night it has been there to remind me that great heroes need great sorrows and burdens otherwise half their greatness goes unnoticed that you can t make real magic by offering up someone else s liver you must tear out your own and not expect to get it back aye it s been a song and a com
3366,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,“who has choices need not choose we must who have none we can love but what we lose what is gone is gone ” the main problem with mythical beasts is that they are so mythical they become their own cliches dragons have been their own ultimate victims the same can be said about mermaids elves and of course unicorns and yet mr beagle offers us a unicorn that is unlike anything you could expect alluring yet strange beautiful enough to make you cry but at the same time beautiful so much
3367,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,this is for all the fans of red bull sure i feel a little haggard after drinking the damn stuff and it also makes you blind and contributes toward a murderous rage toward all unicorns but the drink does grow on you it s just a shame that it makes all the little girls cry sigh that being said the novel itself is a rather wonderful and clear and a perfect example of a self aware fairy tale the fact that it stays simple and strong is a testament to its great writing better than that howe
3368,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,this was one of the first satisfying fantasy reads that i found after the lord of the rings i read it when i came home from my first year of college in num for a long time i felt like i was the only person who had read this book then slowly slowly the recognition for it began to grow the movie came out so wondrously tied to the book and well it should be the author wrote the screenplay and i loved it almost as much as the book all these years later it is a pleasure to see it gaini
3369,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,2,you know what i give up i ve been reading this for over two months and every time i picked it up i was so bored and confused maybe one day i ll go back and read it in a shorter time span but idk the writing was gorgeous and the metaphors were nice but i couldn t connect to the story at all there wasn t enough of the unicorn and it was just strange it had this quality to it that was like the little prince where there seems like there will be some deeper darker message concealed with a lo
3370,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,wonderful story that i read waaay too late in the game the last unicorn is a great quest novel with a driven character in search of the most sympathetic of causes to find out if she is the last of her kind it s filled with a bevy of almost alice in wonderland interesting side characters although i could ve done without the names especially schmendrick the bumbling wizard come on honestly that last point is what holds this back from being a truly great classic in my eyes let me explain 
3371,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,3,i read this mainly because i ve heard it s a fantasy classic and felt i should it was indeed magical and read like a true fairytale with a unicorn and other mythical creatures a noble prince with quests a wizard and an evil king i can see why it s a classic i m only giving it num stars though because the emotional connection and immediateness of more modern fantasy isn t there and it felt like watching the story from afar the characters definitely felt emotions intellectually i know t
3372,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,this book will celebrate it s numth anniversary next year so i m glad i finally got round to reading it it is a charming classic that has stood the test of time well even though a great deal of good fantasy has been published since it first appeared it s message that we should learn to lead our lives well is just as relevant today the characters are quirky and funny i loved the bumbling magician schmendrick who has yet to find his true magic as well as the hero prince lir always off doing
3373,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,michel gondry has a theory that when we sleep our bodies minds souls heart whatever else there might be are opened up and when we awake we want to be close and also explaining why people wake up horny like a kind of rebirth or cleansing of the day to day crap he puts it better than i do because he s michel gondry and i m mariel i dislike to be touched i don t wake up craving physical connections like that i d rather wrap myself up in a cocoon preferably a bubble that way  i could
3374,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,magical one of the best children s fantasy books that i ve ever read the prose is as enchanting as the unicorn everytime the unicorn appears thinks and speaks i am thrown out of this world peter beagle born num is a scintillating american author and he s got a equally dazzling character to mark his place in this literary world none other than what people say as a legendary yet fictional animal the most important imaginary animal of the middle ages and the renaissance the unicorn h
3375,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,num num stars wow why did it take me so long to get around to reading this extraordinary novel i actually only decided to read this now because one of my favorite authors patrick rothfuss mentioned that it was one of his favorite novels of all time well i can certainly see why this is fantasy at its best beautifully written smart and full of heart highly recommended 
3376,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,the world shall not be free until the last unicorn is strangled with the guts of the last hobbit 
3377,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,wow not the ending i thought it would be beautiful 
3378,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,the first encounter i had with the last unicorn was as a child how fitting when my step dad introduced me to the movie i remember falling in love with the art and the music and i ve watched the movie once every year ever since then a while later i got the book and read it the german translation it was very good and different from the movie in some places for example the story of the curse and the village before haggard s castle but for the longest time it was usually me and the movi
3379,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,this book may fool you it s not a once upon a time tale nor is it just for children when i first picked up this book all i knew about it was that a trusted friend whose book recommendations have never led me astray loved it i was under the impression that it was for children and even though i am a self described kid at heart and stalwart defender of children s literature i thought it would be a light read devoid of any complexities well i was wrong the story begins in the lilac woo
3380,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4, it cannot be an ill fortune to have loved a unicorn he said surely it must be the dearest luck of all though the hardest earned as for her she is a story with no ending happy or sad she can never belong to anything mortal enough to want her what a weenie am i i actually got all misty eyed near the end of this book really a sweet story filled with colorfully drawn characters and writing that engages all six of your senses i don t know why i never found this book when i was a young
3381,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,i can see why this is such a fantasy classic i was well served to read it alongside other people forced to read only a few chapters a week this allowed me to notice more things and appreciate the small bits in a way i don t usually do besides having a decent story beagle has a good balance of quirky humor romance and deep thoughts perfect for younger and older readers 
3382,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,i seriously wonder if peter s beagle has synesthesia his choice of adjectives is beautiful and downright tasty sounds have color and texture it s as if he was able to show people what it would be like to walk into a van gogh painting and live inside it his plot is not as it seems at first appearing cliche you may find yourself thinking this is like the start of hundreds of fairy tales i ve read as a kid but you will be delightfully proven wrong his characters are unique and experience
3383,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,i first read “the last unicorn” in my twenties and i didn’t really enjoy it as i was not into unicorns at all a few years back however i came across michael green’s wonderful book “the unicornis manuscripts on the history and truth of the unicorn” and from then on i was hooked on these mythical creatures so when i reread peter beagle’s book i was quite intrigued to see that i preferred it much more the second time around it’s one of those amazing books for all age groups it must have been
3384,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,i ve been hearing for years and years that the last unicorn is a must read for fantasy fans it s true the last unicorn is the story of a unicorn living alone in a wood that finds out she s the last and goes searching for her people along the way she meets a bumbling wizard named schmendrick a feisty woman named molly and eventually a layabout prince named lir as with a fine and private place beagle s writing is spotted with humor i can see his influence in neil gaiman and terry pratchett 
3387,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,we are not always what we seem and hardly ever what we dream a lovely read for both young and old beautiful expressive prose and a wonderful story 
3388,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,having just finished reading the last unicorn i m not at all sure what to say about it or how i feel about it i felt vaguely enchanted by it not in the sense of it being twee and sweet and disney but in the sense of it having a hold over me i loved the writing the richness of it the strange and new descriptions e g the air hung shiny as candy things that don t quite make logical sense and yet you know what they mean i loved the fairytale qualities interspersed with bits of hum
3389,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,one of my early fantasy favorites as a child which would later indirectly influence the writing of my fantasy/fae/myth novel nightglory a full review will be posted later in num 
3391,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,this book is written as a fairy tale but with a twist as it s set in a fully realized but slightly satirical as much as whimsical fantasy world that has inspired everything from the princess bride to stardust and i love it beagle’s story is a romantic fable about a unicorn who leaves the forest she has protected since time immemorial to find more of her kin having never left her forest the unicorn is surprised by the changes in the world but there s no unicorn sightings anywhere she keeps g

3394,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,3,num num num stars another read for the the tolkien professor’s faerie fantasy podcast seminar this book gets a lot of love on goodreads and i kind of see where people are coming from but i have to admit that i didn’t have quite the same rapturous experience of this book as most don’t get me wrong beagle definitely has a way with words his descriptive prose is very evocative and there are some moments of real lyricism here but overall i think he did himself a disservice in a major eleme
3395,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,it is about time i finally found and read the last unicorn and what a fantastic piece this was i cannot believe it is already over just two weeks ago due to work i had to travel to a town i never visited before and while i was walking on main street i happened to pass this adorable used book store i never had luck finding any used book stores near my hometown so this was a treat i roamed this store for a good hour and left with two delightful treasures that i had been seeking for years
3396,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,ermahgerd a ernercern this book was phenomenal i don t think i have ever underlined so much in a book there are so many great quotes this book has been equalled to the earthsea trilogy alice s adventures in wonderland and others i gotta say it towers above them all num stars “great heroes need great sorrows and burdens or half their greatness goes unnoticed it is all part of the fairy tale ” “real magic can never be made by offering someone else s liver you must tear out your own a
3397,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,3,read it for itself a classic of it s type i found this a mildly interesting book it never pulled me in yet it was interesting enough that i stayed with it it s sort of like a weak tea drinkable but not something i m overly pleased with 
3398,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,classics are classics for a reason molly grue is the truest fictional character ever written she s more magical than even the unicorn and the wizard combined 
3399,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,this book has haunted me ever since i first finished it years and years ago i ll be driving down the freeway and the slant of sunlight off of a trucks rear window will suddenly remind me of a line in one of these chapters and a fever will grab hold of me all of a sudden and it won t be quelled until i get home and reread that passage which turns into rereading that chapter which turns into rereading this book i m not safe anywhere i was sick to death recently and the first thing i reached f
3400,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,melancholy peppered with loveable characters added with prose better than tolkien wheew some of you might disagree but as you read this book you live with every word of it you could taste and feel the coldness of haggard s keep and know how every characters emotion at a given situation in a given time the writing is really emotional i think this was page three who knows times change would you call this age a good one for unicorns no but i wonder if any man before us ever thought his
3401,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,the fact that this is my favorite childhood movie brings so much shame to the fact that i am reading it now as an adult years later for the first time i honestly thought the book might be a little corny or possibly a bit cheesy it wasn’t it was honestly one of the best books i have ever read and i am absolutely buzzing about it perfection it was everything a fantastic fantasy should be i can see now why it has been claimed as one of the greatest fantasy books of all time num stars and all
3402,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,peter s beagle works magic bringing lore to life with words as though the moonlit mane and glistening white flanks of the illusive unicorn can be glimpsed if only the reader can tear oneself away from the book 
3403,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,i remember watching that animated movie as a kid and loving it the end always made me cry turns out so does the book 
3404,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,i listened to the audiobook for this the narrator was the author himself this was my first time reading the book though i recall watching the animated movie several times as a kid i still hear mia farrow s voice in my head as the unicorn i liked some of the humor that obviously went over my head when i saw the movie as a kid i have to say the movie followed the book pretty closely and the parts they trimmed were rather unnecessary in the book view spoiler [i don t recall lear being such
3406,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,the last unicorn is quite possibly the most beautiful book ever written the story it tells is of a quest undertaken by the last unicorn molly grue and schmendrik the magician to save the unicorns from the red bull of king haggard what appears at first glance to be a traditional fantasy tale winds up being far more the magician is the last of his own kind however he is also completely incompetent in his art and wishes nothing more than to find his magic so that he may be mortal and die mo
3407,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,a mystical rich touching fun and stunningly written fairy tale i admit to having had the film in mind whilst reading this i couldn t help it i saw it first but in prose form i can say that the book is better the last unicorn contains wonderful passages such as the unicorn lived in a lilac wood and she lived all alone she was very old though she did not know it and she was no longer the careless color of sea foam but rather the color of snow falling on a moonlit night p num 
3408,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,the last unicorn is a unique work among works of fantasy it stands out in many ways from modern fantasy novels and is hard to pigeonhole into a specific subgenre it’s definitely not the more action packed dark and bloody style of sword sorcery nor is it really high fantasy in some ways it has more in common with a fairy tale than modern fantasy or at least a mix between the two and in that way relates more to earlier works of fantasy when it was in its infancy works like lord duns
3409,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,i recently re read this book as part of a group read i ve always loved it but this is one of those books that you only realized how much you love it when you read again beagle s writing is prose poetry this book is also one of the few books that was adapted to film very well in case you don t know the last unicorn is about a unicorn who goes on quest to discover what happened to the rest of her kind she meets a wizard and a woman who add her on the way she learns some un unicorn like tra
3411,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,i read this when i was num or num after being taken to see the film i enjoyed it although it was too advanced for me i remember being confused in places and should really reread it 
3412,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,2,i have never been so devastated by disliking a book i ve wanted to read this book for num years and never gotten around to it my husband read it a few weeks ago reviewed it as being one of the best most beautiful books he s ever read he told me simply you re going to love it so i moved it way up the list and oh it hurts because i did not love it i wanted to so badly the lyric language was quite beautiful for such a cold cynical book nothing that happens really makes sense actio
3413,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,beagle continually surprised me with his unique prose descriptions and metaphors in odd juxtapositions that at first make no sense but then you blink and they make complete sense his dialogue often rang with rhythm and rhyme nudging me to re read a snippet just to hear it roll off my tongue a quest adventure fairy tale fantasy flipped topsy turvy instead of a child pulled unwillingly along by prophecy an undying unicorn discovers she is the last of her kind and leaves to learn their fate 
3414,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,beautiful beautiful pure soulful beauty though i still find it hard that this is compared to tolkien s the hobbit things lose their luster when they are compared no there is no need for comparison here still this is beautiful enough on its own that it must and should be read by every fantasy genre fan 
3415,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,we are not always what we seem and hardly ever what we dream still i have read or heard it sung that unicorns when time was young could tell the difference ’twixt the two—the false shining and the true the lips’ laugh and the heart’s rue ”
3416,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,3,i could not get over the writing not the fairy tale/fable like style i don t mean that i think it was mostly the flow it felt just fragmented to me and jarred me off any connection with the story of the characters and it took me awhile to get over it so much so it colored my experience of reading the story right up to the end so sorry it is rare that i would be unable to connect with a story that a lot of people find so endearing but it happens i guess even to me but this
3417,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,3,sometimes you just miss the boat for some books there is a perfect age to read a given book and for no particular reason you just never get around to it i remember vividly how much i liked the rankin/bass animated movie the last unicorn back in num when i was just num years old though it looks painfully lame now having watched a clip on youtube i should have read the book right then i would have absolutely loved it peter beagle’s prose is truly lyrical and evocative and i loved that aspe
3418,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,i grew up with the movie of this and then realized that it was a book when i was in junior high as crazy as i was about that strange cartoon alan alda as schmendrick the book was on a whole nother level gorgeously written some of the imagery is still with me today this is a magnificent work and a must read for any fantasy fan 
3419,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,2,i really didn t enjoy this book that much and honestly don t get what all the fuss is about i found the story boring and didn t care at all about the characters especially the unicorn maybe i just wasn t in the right mood for it but i could easily have skipped this one 
3421,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,3,far too sad for me to love it but a good book anyway i hated that prince lir and the unicorn were not able to be reunited sigh oh well it was a good fairytale 
3422,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,this was my favorite animated movie growing up—that should have been my first clue that i’m crazy about symbolism—and i finally got around to reading it it did not disappoint the language alone is magical a perfect companion to the story it told i love how in describing something beagle used words associated with the metaphors he was using so if he were using the sea to describe a unicorn the unicorn’s steps would rise and fall as waves and her footprints would splash the sand i don’t
3423,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,i adored this book it reads both as a child s fairy tale and an adult literary novel what a marvel it is it is full of metafictional references to ancient literature religions folk tales and literary symbols of every yearning common to most people for num num years the writing itself is poetic prose full of phrases which are still bringing delight to me in remembrance like a unicorn licking my face under the moon the road that ran from the edge of her forest gleamed like water but when s
3424,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,i remember watching this cartoon as a kid and wimp that i was having tons of nightmares about mommy fortuna that was one scary bi atch still fond memories abounded when i came across this book and i was very excited to read it and see how it matched up with my childhood recollections of the story i came away with this this is no children s fairy tale you benefit from being an adult and reading this to fully appreciate everything the story has to offer aside from it being beautifully wri
3425,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,i d heard of this novel forever but never read it till now the writing alone makes it justly famous crazy beautiful lyrical like tolkien or shakespeare crossed with nums beat poetry the plot is interesting enough too feeling like a well fleshed out myth but my emotions were never quite snagged by it and i think it s because the whole thing just is too heavy on the allegory for my tastes it s similar to when i read c s lewis novels and can admire the lovely writing and cool fantasy b
3426,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,just beautiful i picked this up at my local library as it s a book i ve always wanted to read i always have a happy memory of my dad picking me up and popping me in front of tv with vhs and watching the cartoon of the last unicorn it was both mind blowing magical and just also scary i was only num though  but it was a beautiful cartoon and an absolute fantasy classic in it s own right and the book it s just how i remembered the cartoon the cartoon is so like the book it s unreal i l
3427,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,“the last unicorn lived in a lilac wood and she lived all alone ” the last unicorn is a special little tale i have been very fond of it since childhood and it includes several of my most loved story elements a magician a talking cat adventure a castle mythical creatures good humour and a magical atmosphere although it uses some of the most common patterns of fairy tales and fantasy quests the last unicorn captures them and makes them its own molly grue and schmendrick are by far 
3428,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,i watched the movie of this many times as a child and i loved it so much and only recently learned that it was actually a book first so my first instinct was to buy the book right away all i can say is that they did an amazing job making that movie because it really stayed true to the book i could see this movie playing out again in my head while reading this even though it has been many years since i watched the movie i loved it and now want to go and rewatch the movie it is about the las
3430,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,in prepping for unicorns vs zombies week which was a long time in the making i had taken it upon myself to make a list of books to read featuring unicorns of course the last unicorn topped the list seriously i cannot think about unicorns without thinking about this book and no the unicorn in this book is not bloodthirsty although i had made up my mind earlier to be team unicorn i think had i been on the fence this book would definitely have pushed me onto team unicorn read the rest o
3431,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,i saw the movie when i was a little girl and have always wanted to read the book considering that peter s beagle wrote the screenplay the movie stuck extremely close to the plot i will say that because of his poetic style of writing and the songs throughout reading this book was a bit like going through a dream the writing is beautiful and there are some great descriptions throughout there are a few times when i found it hard to actually get a clear image of places or objects because of i
3432,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,this book literally has it all it s funny it s dramatic it s mysterious it s romantic it s action packed it takes itself seriously and not seriously the plot is simple but wonderful the characters are complex and interesting even when we only meet them for a scene it s insightful and yet non judgmental i can read this book over and over it s one of my favorites i can t recommend it highly enough num reread just as wonderful as the first time this remains one of the most beautifully
3433,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,1,this book screams num s fantasy overly narrative descriptive and boring with lack of any meaningful plot the point is magic unicorns magicians evil creatures no character development or ability to identify with the main character the unicorn who herself is not a very interesting character 
3434,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,brilliant funny and enchanting book though i have to admit i saw the film adaptation first i was six years old mia farrow did a great voice job of the unicorn this book will be loved by anyone who likes fantasy well written novels or anyone just looking for something good to read at random

3436,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,i was getting pretty fed up with fantasy novels until i picked up the last unicorn all of the tired fantasy tropes are done away with here the last unicorn isn’t a tale about tough badasses the last unicorn is old scared and unsure she’s not sure she has a place in the world anymore her wizard companion doesn’t even have a grasp on the most basic of magic spells their enemy is vast and unbeatable this isn’t a lisa frank book it’s whimsical sure but also gloomy and introspective the la
3437,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,all i can think after closing this book is how wonderfully crafted this story was it is whimsical but wise beautiful and kind of dark this is a classic fantasy tale for a reason the last unicorn has elements of myth fairytale and folklore and the tone of the writing is spot on it never digs too deep it always feels like a tale and i like that i guess that is the reason i never felt like i quite knew the characters neither molly schmendrick or the unicorn and yet i cared for them even
3439,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,originally posted here my love affair with this book was just way i liked it slow burning and unexpected i started out feeling fairly lukewarm about the story as it was very simple but like a seed you didn t know was there days went by before i realized that it has grown on me i am not sure if it is because of prince lir s growth from shallow young un to lovesick hero or lady amalthea s painful beauty or molly grue s cream puff solid on the outside but softie on the inside persona 
3440,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,i have seen and read three types of fairytale fantasy published in the last century the first is like patricia c wrede s enchanted forest chronicles it is clever at the expense of fairy tales mocking usually gently the tropes of the genre often through metafictional techniques this type does little for me the second is like most of patricia mckillip s work it takes those same tropes completely seriously and if done well as in mckillip s case reminds us why the tropes exist in the
3441,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,there is a time when most of us humans want to know that magic is true there is a time when most of us need to know that magic is true but there also is a time when us humans stare magic right in the eye and we never realize what we are staring at the story of the last unicorn is a sad but beautiful story about a unicorn that discovers she is the last unicorn in the world she lives alone in a forest and she takes care of the creatures that dwell there spring is always present in her forest

3443,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,the only two peter s beagle books i ve ever read are the last unicorn and a fine and private place both of which i loved in my adolescence so i am not sure why i never read anything else he wrote this book is lovely and has lingered with me ever since i read it at thirteen 
3444,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,if you like the movie or if you like unicorns this book is for you i remember watching the move a few years ago and liking it more then i thought i would the animation was dated and could use a re due with crisper colors but i liked the characters and the story thankfully the book is almost the same thing as the movie partially because the author of this book also wrote the movie s script so if you are afraid the book is different in this case isn t not that different i ve always bee
3445,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,an enchanting delicate tale set in a bewitching fairy tale world it opens with a demonstration of the charms of well told exposition as he describes the unicorn in her woods but all is disturbed when two hunters come they kill nothing they never even see her but they talk about how if there ever were any unicorns they have all vanished she ponders this and eventually must set out to discover why she is the last unicorn whereupon she learns that people no longer see a unicorn when she s
3446,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,i m trying to thin my bookshelves this summer and i thought my old copy of the last unicorn would be an easy candidate to give a final quick read and donate to the local library i had only read it once before when i was about num and i remembered it as being just so so on top of that i m not a big fan of most fantasy books so i was stunned when the last unicorn turned out to be this heartrendingly beautiful work of art which i clearly didn t appreciate when i was younger i think the writi
3447,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,3,unicorns are bitches sometimes don t worry about it i am not worrying about it ammm i don t hate it but it s meh i know that for many it s the ultimate fantasy book but somehow i wasn t touched by its magic fantasy retelling when author minces few fairy tales or myths into one modern book are quite common and i would regard the last unicorn as a very first try to make it work maybe the myths author was playing with were a little unknown to me or it was made for younger audiences
3448,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,the unicorn is the protagonist of this story who begins to question her place in the world she overhears a couple hunters in the woods debating whether or not unicorns still exist sparking in her the desire to venture out in order to try to find others like herself along the way she meets an eclectic group of folks who all in some way affect your journey in the process she comes to terms with what happened to the rest of the unicorns and battles the red bull in an effort to save the world i
3449,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,this is another book that if rated based on my memory i d have been way off the mark i m certain it was a much different read at age num or whenever the height of my unicorn loving phase was than now as an adult with a stronger sense of how deep both longing and loss can be all those themes of life and death and the beauty of the ephemeral certainly would have gone over my head beagle s writing is heartbreakingly beautiful and his sentiments so wise on top of all that this book has such a
3450,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,1,some pretty prose bits but overall predictable dnf page num out of library time 
3451,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,a wonderful and enchanting story that reads like a fairy tale that knows how to be a fairy tale always switching between deep comments on life in general to absolutely ridiculous humour so you never know how you ll feel about the next page and written with absolutely gorgeous descriptive writing with beautiful imagery it was an easy num/num stars for me full review on my blog http //bastardreading blogspot ie/num 
3452,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,3,i enjoyed this whimsical story but since i put it down for a while i fell out of love with this book i can see why patrick rothfuss says this is his favorite book of all time but wasn t really my cup of tea 
3453,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,such a gorgeous book this is one of the classics of fantasy poetic wry tender a luminous look at how wonder and magic can fade from the world

3456,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,i ve known this was originally a book for a long time but the animated adaptation was my first introduction to this story i m surprised actually by how close the adaptation was and how well the characters voices and visages matched the tone of the story i ve wanted to read the book for years and finally did it i m very glad i did it was such a joy to read and i loved the soft sweet descriptions and the incredibly poignant presentation of human nature when viewed from the point of vie
3457,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,there is something magical and very special about the last unicorn penned by peter s beagle from the world creation to the rich characters to the lessons deftly woven within i was recently gifted this audio version by a friend in which prolific author mr beagle himself narrates his host of characters including of the unicorn schmendrick molly grue mommy fortuna and the red bull of king haggard the unicorn s journey of discovery changes not only each character but the world wander in

3460,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,3,this was a fun well written book i think i struggled to know what genre the author was going for it started out feeling like a more serious fantasy type as it went on it almost felt like it was making fun of the fairytale/fantasy genre it reminded me of the princess bride a bit in that although not nearly as good it fell a little flat when they got to the castle and the love story seemed contrived to me the character of the unicorn seemed a little one dimensional i did enjoy molly a
3461,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,this is one of the most beautiful books i ve read every sentence every paragraph is so poetically beautiful it fills you with an urge to stop to savor it admire it and reflect it upon it this is my most highlighted book i think it s fitting to share my favorite “when you are old anything that does not disturb you is a comfort cold and darkness and boredom long ago lost their sharp edges for us but warmth singing spring—no they would all be disturbances ” “you deserve the services of a

3464,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,bloody magnificent fantasy more than fit to stand shoulder to shoulder with lotr and narnia 
3465,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,an amazing book please see my review on my blog http //thesoulwanderers blogspot ca/num 
3466,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,i remember watching this movie so much as a child that i ruined the vhs tape never knew it was based off of a book so when i saw it at a bookstore i knew i had to have it and read it it was like watching the movie as i was reading the scenes came to life in some parts it was so lyrical that you couldn t help but sing the words this will always be the one thing that will remind me of my childhood innocence and belief in fairy tales 
3467,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,wow wow i had no idea my head is spinning a little i m trying to restrain myself from gushing with superlatives here and failing best book i ve read for the first time in the past year best modern fairy tale i ve ever read one of the best fantasy books i ve read period i was of course already very familiar with the nums animated film version of this book and have loved it since i was a kid in spite of the cheesy america soundtrack i d been meaning to read the book for decades and w
3468,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,the last unicorn is one of those books which i kept hearing great things about over the years but never got around to reading i’m not sure why maybe it was the title that didn’t quite appeal or perhaps it was the various covers i’d seen which put me off i don’t know it just didn’t call out to me in a loud enough voice it turns out this was my loss as the last unicorn is a fabulous story so what made me read it after all this time well i started reading a copy of peter s beagle’s lates
3469,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,i love the last unicorn while it s not technically a young adult novel but more of a children s fantasy it can be enjoyed at all ages as i ve just finished it for the first time and completely fell in love with it it s a whimsical hopeful fantasy classic i watched the movie ages ago and have had the book sitting on my shelf for a while it s a quick and gripping read the story of a unicorn who begins a journey to find more of her kind the humans in the world have become so hopeless and
3470,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,the last unicorn by peter s beagle is another one of the iconic tales that shaped my childhood of course my first encounter with the wild and rare unicorn was through the animated movie but i soon found the book and the moment i opened its pages i was done for the writing is elegant descriptive and profound without being dense or heavy handed the narrative flows smoothly what i find particularly compelling is that many of the characters are presented to us as hollow or incomplete arch
3471,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,this is certainly one of the more beautifully written books i have ever read coming into this story having only known it as a slightly racy children’s movie i expected it to be a fair bit more childish i definitely wasn’t ready for the gorgeous prose i encountered here prose which invited a slower and more contemplative second reading of nearly every other sentence in an effort to parse out the secondary meanings from beagle’s sometimes confusingly beautiful similes for any lover of good
3472,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,i had a hard time rating this book i m torn between num and num stars it was good num or num stars but didn t quite live up to my expectations num or num stars so num num anyway i had a hard time getting into the book the writing was very lyrical like all the reviews say but maybe too lyrical for me i need story but things started happening and characters were introduced and i started liking it more and more until finally it was hard to put down i guess the only thing i didn t like about the boo
3473,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,i was ten or so when i saw the animated movie the last unicorn the first time i have seen it dozens and dozens of time since then and i never really thought there was a book behind it when i first realized this was the case a year or so ago i figured i knew the story so why bother oh how mistaken i was i m glad to have read it the language is extra ordinarily metaphor laden and there are details that did not appear in the book it s the most beautiful prose i have ever read the story
3474,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,this was a fantastic book i m surprised i never read it until now i look forward to reading it again in the future and hopefully aloud as i think it will work really well for that one of the things that was interesting about reading it was that i had just come off a stephen king book that was so verbose that i was skimming everything this book was the complete opposite so much could change about the world and story within single sentence that i had to constantly slow myself down take note
3475,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,i read this under several objections most them having to do with how ridiculous the title and the cover look especially if you are over thirty carrying it around but author after author i love kept talking about peter s beagle and the last unicorn they didn t suggest reading it they just assumed that all the writers and readers in the room had the same way they assume that everyone has read lotr so i read it and i can t understand how peter s beagle did it how he can make us all be th
3476,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,first off can i just say that this is probably the most beautifully written children s book i have ever read it even puts other classics to shame compared to the last unicorn narnia reads like the scrawlings on a men s bathroom stall unlike a lot of people i never read the book/watched the movie as a child so i didn t have to contend with my childhood impression of the story i must say it was kind of nice to read it with an adult s eyes because there were a lot of deep truths woven in
3478,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,a short sweet and bittersweet fantasy about unicorns and wizards enchantments monsters and heroes beagle has gentle fun with this fairy tale quest winking and teasing his readers with soft ironies intermixed with a lullaby of a story it doesn t take long to read this classic and i can strongly recommend it to anyone susceptible to an innocent archetypal myth •     •     •     •     •     •     •     • p s from the new yorker 
3479,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,the opening paragraph is so delicately beautiful the unicorn lived in a lilac wood and she lived all alone she was very old though she did not know it and she was no longer the careless color of sea foam but rather the colour of snow falling on a moonlit night but her eyes were still clear and unwearied and she still moved like a shadow on the sea this book is like finding a little gleaming seashell at the beach that you tuck into your pocket to take home with you you keep it on
3480,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,2,i still want to see the movie again because it made me cry my eyes out when i was little but goddam did i just not get the book i don t understand what the anachronisms are for i don t get the king lear allusion i don t get whether i m supposed to care about lir i love all the female characters both maybe i can count a third but ultimately they re pretty transparent props and i feel like the message about violence is pretty fuckin ambivalent also the writing felt turgid but whatever 
3481,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,2,well hmmm what the heck is wrong with me everyone just loves this book so much i m relieved to see my buddy sarah only gave it num stars as well i just could not get into this i gave it num pages that should be enough maybe it was the wrong timing i need to take a break from fantasy i ended up returning it to the library well before the due date but because this is such a favorite i had remorse and put it on hold again maybe after i m done with my current books i ll give it another try
3482,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,this is such a sweet lovely book by turns poignant and wistful and utterly silly the last unicorn says a lot more about life and love and beauty than you might suspect from just reading the book s summary and for anyone who believes that deconstructing fantasy tropes is some sort of new fad just check out this num year old subversive tale and you ll learn something wonderful and new if you have a chance listen to the audio of this book it s narrated by peter beagle himself and he makes
3483,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,one of the most beautiful stories i have ever read in my life i read it as a child and it has stayed with me ever since there s a certain melancholy sweetness about it that touches your soul its lyrical prose just floats off the page like the softest down it s like having a dream about a poem you once heard many years ago i m such a fan of this book that i even have a signed deluxe copy including the coda two hearts by the man himself soppy i know but it s one of the rare few books that
3484,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,it seems that most young children believe in unicorns at some point as did i many years ago this wonderful fairytale written in num which reminded me a lot of princess bride with its humor unlikely romances bumbling characters magic spells evil king and monsters and a story that appeals to all ages tells of the quest that the last apparent unicorn embarks on accompanied by an inept magician and an old woman to find her lost fellows the writing is lyrical and witty the characte
3485,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,so if you re like me and grew up with the cartoon you d probably enjoy the book as well it was mostly the same with only a couple differences i feel like the movie was a bit better though only because in places i thought the writing felt a little slow and dry but that could only be my nostalgia glossing over the cartoon version in any case it was still a lovely book and i enjoyed reading it 
3486,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,2,you know i really loved the japanimation movie made from this story when i was little but i didn t find reading this book to be all that gratifying of an experience it took way longer than it should have for such a thin novel i even quit reading before bed for over a week to avoid this one while lyrical some of the prose was hard to follow and i did not enjoy all the strange songs randomly put in here and there just an ok book sort of disappointing 
3487,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,this story was read aloud to me by a dear friend as we drove through the mountains of colorado which is perhaps the most ideal way to experience this novel the prose is fantastic the characters complex and endearing the story punctuated with insight into humanity everything that makes a children s story wonderful 
3488,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,it was such an unusual tale i can t sort out my feelings i would give it a num num because of the confusing beginning and underwhelming ending but everything else was great strange and beautiful i would recommend it to everyone everywhere dare not put it in children s or fantasy shelf 
3489,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,it s been nearly twenty years since i last read this but still every page felt familiar as breathing and anyone who doesn t agree that this is one of the greatest fantasy novels of all time can fight me

3494,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,read for the num popsugar reading challenge this is a childhood classic you ve never read although after reading it i m surprised it s such a childhood book for so many people because this thing is kind of bleak the idea of the last anything is inherently a bit sad and tragic add to that a magician who is incapable of reliably doing any magic and is treated like some kind of carnival sleight of hand sideshow as well as a middle aged woman who dreamed of a unicorn s miracles in her y

Beagle,4,i saw the movie as a child and was convinced that the writing of the original book is the real hero so i decided to give the book a try i should have read this earlier and ignored my thoughts that watching the movie first would ruin the book the last unicorn is elegantly written flowing both beautifully and poetically the metaphors and descriptors are pretty out of this world making it read like a true fairytale overall the story is just lovely the imagery is magical the unicorn lived in
3498,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,1,what a shame i thought i would like this book but i guess this is a classic case of it s not you it s me an interesting enough storyline but the silliness of the characters trumped and affection i had towards the book in general the characters weren t real enough for me the wizard i forgot his name it was way too long mary grue and prince lír felt like something out of a kid s cartoon adorable with their inane and fatuous actions but at the end of the day still flat everything we
3499,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,this is the book i expected when reading nobel prize winner kazuo ishiguro s the buried giant peter s beagle wrote a classic post modern novel up ending fairy tales and fantasy tropes and expectations while somehow remaining true to the form the prose is flowery in places but it doesn t disturb as it enhances the dream fairytale like quality of the novel the characters are thin fairy tale characters but beagle twists them and adds just enough depth to keep the fairy tale quality and inte
3501,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,recently i was thinking about music that i like and i determined that often the stuff that i love the most is that which successfully pulls off being bittersweet and/or whimsical so i guess it s no surprise that i like books that are in the same vein i loved all of the characters in this and the adventure that they went on the character development for certain characters was also amazing as were the bonds that were formed i whole heartedly recommend this to anyone who likes fairy tales f
3502,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,beagle is at his best in the beginning of this book in my opinion before things get dark and droll he has a witty sense of humor that is full of fun and original non sequiturs as the novel progresses though he gets a bit too glum and dull in the castle when the unicorn becomes human and the prince is doing is schtick when beagle is at his best is when he s turning things on their head at the beginning and end of this book it s definitely well worth reading just be prepared to have to push
3504,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,2,i think this was a whoosh situation because i cannot understand why this book has such great reviews i had no idea what was happening ever i know it was written in the nums or whatever so i should be able to give it some grace but i was largely just bored and confused the actual opposite of how a fantasy book should be on a side note is this book how red bull got it s name that s cool num num stars 
3505,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,this book was published in num the same year that i was born i can hardly believe that i hadn’t read this book until we were both fifty years old it’s delightful you’ll want all of your friends and family to read it anyone who loves traditional fairy tales will appreciate this novel’s sensibilities and will hopefully appreciate its modern romance i now see so much of its influence in contemporary writers like naomi novik

3509,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,a great mix of fantasy elements tragedy and a wonderful sense of humor though the book is not a particularly long read it did not seem as if anything is missing beagle seems to know perfectly well how much time to spend on anything every small side character is written in an interesting way and worth remembering the protagonists have a good dynamic and every dialog or deed seems relevant for their arcs if i had ro nitpick a little i would say that experiencing the unicorn forgetting over t
3510,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,can t wait to read this again and underline passages peter beagle doesn t have just a gift with words but a magic wand i m floored by how beautiful this was 
3512,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,i loved the animated version of the last unicorn when i was a kid all of the films from that studio fascinated me they also did the flight of dragons my favourite and the most frightening version of the hobbit you ll ever watch they were all a bit eerie and off putting as the motion the character designs and the adult voices always felt a bit wrong to me as a kid that was part of what made them different and interesting though i m not sure how i didn t know this but it wasn t until a
3513,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,beautiful part of me wishes i had read this as a child but i also enjoyed reading it as an adult and tripping back into the sheer wonder of it while also being able to appreciate the larger metaphors lovely writing with so many truly unique turns of phrase but it never felt too precious for the story so wonderful 
3514,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,i ve never seen the cartoon but now i ll definitely have to i ve never been a fan of unicorns but i have to say this was a pretty great book 
3515,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,1,dropping at num because it s not engaging me i m curious about how it will end and i put off watching the movie for years in order to read this but the journey doesn t seem worth the destination 
3516,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,the last unicorn is one of those tales that is so finely written it makes me wonder if there is any writing left to be done 
3517,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,the last unicorn is an amazing fairy tale i think everyone should read peter s beagle has a great imagination and a wonderful writing style that grabs you right from the start i m looking forward to reading more of this authors work i give the last unicorn num stars for its imaginative fairy tale i would recommend this book to everyone 
3518,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,perplexing unquestionable but always true ends in the best way possible 
3519,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,luminous and beautifully written i can t think of another fantasy novel quite like it first off i struggled as i couldn t really find a strong sense of pace but realise now that like a medieval ballad crossed with a fairy tale this is a part of the story s uniqueness 
3520,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,3,i came into this book with a high feeling of excitement and anticipation for some reason it was one of those books that i d always heard great things about and intended to read but had never gotten around to people love the last unicorn both the film and the book and i truly thought that it would be something that i too would enjoy and maybe even love but i was wrong try as i might i just couldn t get into this book i found it to be weird and way to hopped up on the flower power of the
3521,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,i read peter s beagle s the last unicorn in my freshman seminar and i have no idea what happened to my print copy but i got an ebook version in a humble bundle a couple of years ago so recently i read it again the last unicorn is both a fairy tale and sort of a send up of fairy tales it s got a lot of flowery atmospheric language that doesn t always make concrete sense and also a lot of jokes and anachronisms and funny names i remember not really getting it when i first read it i may
3522,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,i read this book several summers ago and found it amazing maybe it was the cartoon that made me want to read it i don t know but one thing i do know is that this was an excellent read our book starts off with a unicorn who is alone in a forest she then begins to wonder if she is the last of the unicorns and goes on a journey in search for them on the journey she meets two people schemdrick hope i spelled that right the magician and molly these two people decide to help the unicorn in her s
3523,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,3,i liked the symbolic substance of the text but the story didn t have it and i would liked to have a different ending 
3524,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,a wonderful beautifully written book my only regret is not reading it sooner it deserves a spot on the shelf next to lewis tolkien and white 
3525,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,i stand by my original review but want to add two things num it s super aggravating to me as an adult how often men talk over molly grue num a tall thin man with an air of resolute bewilderment is the best character intro ever my book reviews lately seem to fall in two camps this book is silly and stupid or this book is the second coming of christ the last unicorn is even more than that though the last unicorn is transcendent it is genre making and genre destroying it is the alpha and
3526,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,i have always wanted to read this novel since seeing the animated rankin/bass production from the early nums author peter s beagle adapted his novel into the screenplay i thoroughly enjoyed revisiting the story of the last unicorn who goes in search of her missing folk she gets the two best friends anybody can have schmendrick the ageless wizard and molly the cook for a band of outlaws i love the variety of characters and their personalities and types but only wish that there were more c
3528,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,every once in a while a book will come along and get written and be released to the world and become something so special and unique that it will stand the tests of time whether it was published last year or fifty years ago or a hundred years ago in the magical fairytale style of the princess bride the last unicorn by peter s beagle is certainly one of those ethereal books that generation after generation will read and enjoy for years to come “the unicorn lived in a lilac wood and she liv
3529,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,2,you probably know of the dress that almost caused the great divide confession first time i saw white and gold fool cries half of the world right says the other but when someone taught me the trick of squinting and looking at it through the pinhole of my curled palm it turned into blue and black before my very eyes and at that moment i was convinced i was magic but what does that have to do with this anything i wanted to like this book because i read it was similar to the princ
3530,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,this book was so beautiful i wanted to hug it in fact i may have i looooved the last unicorn movie as a kid and watched it repeatedly but i’m ashamed to say until recently i didn’t even realise it was a book i ordered it as soon as i discovered it was and finally got around to reading it this week from the opening lines “the unicorn lived in a lilac wood and she lived all alone she was no longer the careless color of sea foam but rather the color of snow falling on a moonlit night ”
3531,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,the last unicorn is one of my all time favorite childhood movies but i didn t know until recently that it was based on a wonderful book by peter s beagle full of mythical creatures and magicians the last unicorn is a complex and enchanting fantasy story that wraps the reader up in it s timeless magic the novel begins in the lilac wood of the unicorn as she listens in to two hunters arguing over the existence of unicorns in the world after realizing that she had not seen another unicorn in
3532,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,i was introduced to the last unicorn through a grainy vhs tape borrowed from my grandparents my sister and i watched it way too much many more years later than i care to admit to i discovered that this story that had embedded itself in my childhood was based on a novel i immediately picked up the book version and got lost in the same fairy tale world only this time i found a story even deeper and more touching than i remembered the last unicorn is about a unicorn who has lived long withou
3533,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,this is the book with the worst synopsis if you can call the goodreads’ summary that that i’ve ever seen which i fortunately read after reading the book otherwise there would have been no need to read the book after all congratulations goodreads for your synopses you’re that villain with no heart that i thought only existed on children’s books and on some archetypical epic fantasy series i’m glad that the synopsis on the physical book was different and that nevertheless i didn’t read it 
3534,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,the last unicorn despite its very short page count is one of those books i would consider as literary genius first of all there is an absolutely magical almost breath taking quality to peter s beagle s writing the way he writes is poetry in motion and because it was meant to be a short story the writing is absolutely razor sharp vivid imaginative and even whimsical at times nothing feels wasted as the paragraphs flow so beautifully from one to the other the unicorn lived in a lilac wood 
3535,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,first of all i want to say upfront that this genre isn t really my thing i ve been racking my brains for a while about why this kind of fairytale esque fantasy doesn t appeal to me and i think ultimately it comes down to the fact that it doesn t feel real i couldn t believe that the characters were real people they seemed somehow cold and distant and their personalities fluctuated in strange ways that made it hard to get a sense of who they really were or that the events of the story a
3537,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,i am ashamed that i haven t read this before i was a great devotee of the movie when i was young and it wasn t until i was a teen that i even realized there was a book but even then i remember checking it out once and trying it but just preferring the movie silly girl the book is just as good and definitely more profound or maybe i have just lived enough now to see that it is profound the last unicorn doesn t know she is the last until she hears a hunter speak the words her journey to
3538,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,why does it seem that some of the best literature is categorized as chldren s literature i ve read hemingway joyce dickens and a host of others but i ve never felt as satisfied with most of them as i do after completing children s literature first if you have ever seen the animated movie based on this book you ve only seen half the story i did see the movie back when it first came out in a theatre yes i am that old and very much loved it but the book has so much more a movie is n
3539,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,i watched this as a child it was the first movie to make me cry thirty five years old and i still can t watch the movie without welling up so i figured it was about time i read the book and oh the book is even more delightful for all its tragic beauty the prose is gorgeous the imagery spellbinding we follow the story of an immortal unicorn who discovers she may be the last of her kind she must leave her forest and go in search of the other unicorns or else she will never be at peace 
3540,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,the last unicorn is one of the rare novels that i ve come to love and it is one of the rare occasions that i have come to love both the book and the movie adaption i ve had this book on my shelf collecting dust for many years before i rekindled my adoration for the film and finally deciding to pick this up and read to find the similarities and differences while the film adaptation that some may be very familiar with is both beautiful and enchanting i ve also found the book to be just as so t
3541,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,this book omg this book it remains one of my all time favorites two things resonated the most with me identifying why this book is considered a classic num when molly furious yells where were you when i needed you at the unicorn it wasn t just about being rescued but how molly needed to believe in magic as a young girl but none ever appeared to her so she grew up jaded and bitter and hurting and when the magic i e the unicorn finally shows up molly is angry that it s come too la
3542,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,the last unicorn is a cross between bittersweet fairy tale and a self aware postmodern story it deals with love and loss real and make believe forgetting oneself and remembering who you are it is one of those rare books that can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their age or gender peter beagle has a way with words he manages to paint a vivid picture without a complex vocabulary i wish i hadn’t been turned off by the title when i was younger as i’m sure it would have become one of my fav
3543,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,3,num num is my actual score this is my second time reading this book the first time i went through it on audio about a year ago and it was pretty awful the narrator the author himself was monotone and uninspired i found it extremely hard to focus now going back and reading it i can see why not only did the author do a bad job at narrating but the prose of the book is very unique i d say old school even just like a fairy tale that s exactly what this book is too a fairy tale and a good on
3544,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,i actually finished reading the last unicorn a month ago but it took me this long to stop weeping enough that i could see to type peter s beagle s classic tale of a unicorn who leaves her home to discover what s become of the rest of her kind is filled to the brim with songs and stories magic and mysteries harpers and harpies enchanted clocks and talking skulls and all the love and loss that make life so goddamned beautiful and heartbreaking and then just when you think you may never rec
3545,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,3,for a long time i thought i d read this book and just hadn t loved it then i read something else by beagle loved it and realized that i d been confusing the last unicorn with mark helprin s winter s tale based solely on the cover art so i was rather excited to finally read this unfortunately i didn t love this book either it was ok but one of the great classics of fantasy hmm it s really more of a book about fantasy then it is a fantasy it s too meta for me too much allegor
3546,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,written with gentle wit and a deceptively straightforward presentation the last unicorn creates a complex and completely believable world that combines familiar fairy tale mythologies with a contemporary shrewdness that somehow manages to avoid being too clever too garrulous or too slyly modern for its own good – something no other fantasy novel however well known seems to have accomplished as a result the last unicorn is unlike any fantasy novel that i’ve read and the supplemental story
3547,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,i am not particularly fond of unicorns yet i am very fond of this book the story itself is not especially complicated nor is the book especially long on the contrary it s actually quite a short tale what truly sets this story apart is the prose beagle writes with wonderful authority and great confidence bordering on poetry the entire book may be read in one short sitting not simply because it is short but also because it is so easy to read there is also an almost heartbreaking honesty a
3548,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,2,the last unicorn is one of those books that at some point during the reading i realize that there s a lot of symbolism/metaphor stuff going on and i m not really getting it those kinds of books are always slightly disappointing to me i d rather have a story especially a fantasy like this one work on multiple levels where repeated readings reveal the symbolism rather than having it be so obvious at first in any case the story follows the titular unicorn as she searches the land for the
3549,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,1,i tried to have an open mind about the imaginative nature of the last unicorn but i almost felt my creativity being stunted as i read it i found the character development weak and the plot boring and random having not experienced this story as a child i had no choice but to approach it as an adult with logic/reason forgive me i don t believe in unicorns as a result i was secretly hoping the mission to save the last unicorn would fail sending a message that boys wielding wands with
3551,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5, and when the professors prowl through the old tales and scholars sift the old songs to learn if robin hood ever truly lived they will never never find my name not till they crack the world for the grain of its heart this is one of those books yes it is for me it s a high fantasy story which i found anything but boring or aimless as i tend to do with high fantasies but it s a lot more than that and that s probably better understood by reading for yourself i found the red bull terrif
3552,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,wow how did i miss this one i think that i thought it was that book about unicorns by mark helprin [edit a winter s tale] which i read as a teenager and didn t really like this one is much better it reminded me of the once and future king in its blending of classical fantasy and modern allusions it seemed like a children s book at first but it s really not more like a fairy tale for adults which is not to say young people couldn t or shouldn t read it beagle is a marvelous writer he ma
3553,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,2,i read this in an omnibus of beagle s work the fantasy worlds of peter s beagle i did enjoy it but i didn t love it i think it s just one of those books you have to fall in love with when you re young if i had read it as a kid it would have been magical as an adult not so much it was a well written and entertaining read though so i m going with two stars it was ok 
3555,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,1,this has got to be one of the worst books i have ever read mainly since nothing really happens they go on this journey for half the novel and then they find this castle and we meet these random characters who have nothing to do with the ones we met at the beginning the plot is a little episodic and i didn t like that i found beagle s style very boring as well i m all for detailed writing i advocate for detailed writing but i hated the way it was written i m not eactly sure what it was abo
3556,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,somehow i never read this as a kid and so i was excited when my online book club selected it this is the kind of book that really should be read aloud the language is gorgeous and slyly funny i m not sure if kids would really appreciate all of it but it would help the adult reading it along chapters are about num pages in length so maybe a tad on the long ish side for a nighttime readalong i don t know how this works it s smart and funny and honestly broke my heart a bit recommended 
3557,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,a strange book certainly but beautiful the writing is quite ethereal heavy at times and meant to be spoken aloud with love i m a little surprised this is achildren s book there are some really hard and adult concepts to grasp and while they are good lessons for children they are wrapped in carefully guarded and subtle words still a little something both adults and children to enjoy and maybe the children will understand it with more clarity view spoiler [ i almost wished for a happie
3558,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,i ve always loved the movie and now finally managed to get the book too while the movie is a very faithful adaptation of the book in terms both of style and plot there s just a bit more to the book it s maybe the most melancholic piece of literature i ve ever read in a good way though although it just kinda makes you want to get a hug after you re done and that although the ending is actually quite happy loved it one classic well worth the label 
3559,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,this is a charming tale in many ways it is about what it is to be in a fairy tale with many of the characters being aware of their roles in other ways it is a pastiche with odd references to the modern world such as bottle tops magazines and tacos for me the parts were better than the whole but the whole left me with a warm feeling i am not sure i can say any more than that give it a shot 
3560,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,3,i remember the animated movie from my childhood while i couldn t remember much of the story i could remember the wonder and awe that i had after seeing it i didn t feel that way about the book it was an interesting fantasy tale but i didn t really care for any of the characters and wasn t particularly moved it was a good read but one i will most likely forget quickly maybe i ll rent the movie again and see if that changes my mind 
3561,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,2,it is an odd book sometimes it seemed like a mixture of a night in the lonesome october book of the new sun and lord of light it was illogical the story line was confusing you could not believe the narrators they either lied or spoke in riddles the language and narration were old fashioned i did like the unicorn though num out of num finishing the book coincided with visiting stirling castle where unicorn in the dominating thing on all tapestries coincidence 
3562,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,5,i love this book it is my chicken soup book when i m down i turn to this book it is the story of a unicorn on the search to find out if she is truly the last one along the way she picks up a wizard and molly what is great about this book it is not about second chances but that important third or fourth chance you might really need it has one of the best ending i have ever read ever word perfectly choosen 
3563,The Last Unicorn,Peter S. Beagle,4,i fought against this book i knew there was no way i would be pleased with the direction it took all the foreshadowing about destiny it was too melancholy i wanted to put it down before it was too late for me to shrug it off the unicorn should never have left her safe home in the woods no don t go out into the world i begged her nothing good would come of it and yet the author was able to leave me with a feeling of hope and that will have to be enough 
3564,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,re read on audio great narrator i still felt like it s a num star 😊 now hopefully i can keep going before i forget most of this one again old review i really did like this book and i look forward to seeing what happens in the other books in the series there will be some mild spoilers karigan g ladheon is a wonderful character sometimes she made me mad with the choices she made but they always turned out for the best she is running away after being expelled from school for somethin
3565,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,here is the story of how i didn t read green rider for years i received an arc of green rider from the publisher when it first came out asking if i could blurb it i set it on the corner of my desk my younger daughter had recently run out of tamora pierce books she asked if she could try green rider and i said sure let me know what you think of it and then i ll read it so off she went with it and it went to camp with her as her read then it went to school with her and was passed aroun

3567,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,when i read the back of this book i thought wow sounds like the heralds of valdemar and if you point out some generalities it sounds even more so young heroine special horses magical abilities messengers for the king wow sounds familiar talia young heroine special horses companions magical abilities mind magic messengers for the king heralds act as messengers but that s where the similarities end unless you want to add good writing characterization and plot to the mix the wo

3569,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,i’ve had this series on my shelves for years it was one of the few i was incredibly excited to start which makes it all the more disappointing that i didn’t like it my num star “it was just okay” rating sums it up perfectly it was just okay the first chapter started off with the bang then it proceeded to meander through one inconsequential event after another and i could feel my enthusiasm dropping with every page at one point i was more than halfway through the book and still couldn’t se
3570,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,1,not good mary sue main everything revolves around this girl which can be okay as a device if the author handles it right this one didn t sigh the overall story also suffers from a common problem in fantasy world building too much if magic horses and riders aren t enough for the tired old the throne is threatened oh no must save it trope add bad elves ancient magics rich men who mysteriously fall for the heroine shadowy bad guys disney esque old ladies in isolated magical mansions
3571,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,every now and then a book comes along that changes your life that isn t this book but sometimes while you re waiting for that book you come across a book that was entertaining and really good fun that s this book 
3572,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,this is a perfectly serviceable little fantasy the references to the lord of the rings and even star wars are prevalent but that in itself doesn’t really bother me there are many successful novels out there that owe allegiance to the classics of fantasy harry potter anyone the only problem is the constant lotr references led me to compulsorily compare this book to its older more experienced more complex better grandfather and i say compulsorily because i really didn’t want to i t
3573,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,this was a fairly typical ya fantasy it stands out only because it was well written and has a strong female lead character karigan g ladheon is fleeing from her school where she has just been suspended to her home but along the way she encounters a dying green rider the man has been shoot with two black arrows the green riders are the king s elite messenger service and with his dying breath the man manages to convince karigan that she must complete his mission and deliver the message he i
3574,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,i was not sure what to expect from this book as the author was new to me and the title didn t quite grab my attention even though it reminded me of those very old fantasy books which are normally solid bets i only decide to read it due to the recommendations of friends and i am glad that i did in a way i guess that i wasn t wrong about the old school feeling as this is a very classic fantasy story and gave off a tolkienesque vibe so classic fantasy you know what to expect then one th
3575,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,so i really feel like the green rider demonstrates what a fantasy novel should really be just enough world building to pique the interest with a lot of the usual fantasy tropes bobbing to the surface ancient wars forgotten magic elite bodyguards aloof faeries/elves hidden in the forests etc but other details that make it uniquely its own the world building is not so overwhelming that is swamps the action or waters down the characters too much the pacing kept quick and exciting as ka

3582,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,green rider by kristen britain num num i was kind of disappointed by the book this time around i ve evolved as a reader while the second half of the book was pretty good the first half was basically a huge info dump while the protagonist made her way to the real story since this was her first book i m inclined to be generous with my rating but i truly had trouble getting through the book this time karigan is a head strong main character and it s basically her spunk and the few friends she
3583,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,green rider starts out rough for starters it has a blurb from terry goodkind on the cover and an acknowledgement to him back in num when this book was first published i m sure it seemed like a great marketing decision now maybe not so much in the first half of the book karigan the protagonist is really irritating granted she s a teenager and it s established that she s something of a rebel and i imagine that if most of us were thrown into a fantasy adventure we d probably complain t
3584,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,looking through a bookstore one day i was immediately attracted by the cover upon reading the book i was rather pleased with the result a nice novel with adventure magic and intrigue it remains a book i read over and over again the story begins with karigan running away from school she won in a fight with a rich kid and wants to tell her father her end of the story however she runs into a dying green rider with a life and death message for the king as she swears to deliver the message h
3585,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,an excellent page turning series starter it s essentially non stop action from beginning to end a perfect book for folks new to fantasy or old hands like myself at times it strays towards cheesy but rights itself quickly it s a more than less self contained stand alone with a few over arching dangling plot threads to lead into the next novel a terrific cast of characters that i look forward to reading again i would highly recommend it to all of my fantasy reading friends 
3586,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,i ve read this book so many times my copy is starting to come apart i absolutely love it the main character karigan is so believable i can relate easily to her and i know that most people would feel the same the story is very original and engaging it s definitely a must read for any fantasy book fan 
3587,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,most of my commentary on this book actually has to do with its similarities to mercedes lackey s heralds of valdemar after all that was the reason i picked it up but since other reviewers have addressed it i ll just summarize it like so easy to see the parallels and at the time it seems almost derivative however there are distinct differences so addressing green rider itself if i recall this is britain s first book and it does show could stand for some better editing run on senten
3588,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,i picked up this book because of an eye catching cover followed by a few good reviews i ran across while browsing around i m glad i did this is a fairly standard fantasy work in a lot of ways karigan is practically shoved into the role of heroine when circumstances lead her to come across a man dying with two black arrows in his back who pleads with her to carry his urgent message to the king she is quickly thrust into life or death situations meeting all sorts of strange people along her
3589,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,1,listened to around num chapters on audiobook format this book started out wonderfully well okay i ve never been a big fan of watching the bad guy rub his hands gleefully while doing evil deeds as a prologue but the magic was interesting we get thrown into the action almost from the word go with the main character karigan runs across the path of a dying messenger and taking up his mission what followed was a exciting chase scene and more interesting magic then the berry sisters showed up
3590,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,1,i got about num/num of the way through couldn t take it any more the narration was good i liked the horse but other than that it was pretty awful too many details were poorly done obviously for the convenience of the story her wrists are burned but not her hands clothes or any other part the dialogue was awful the characterization childish 
3591,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,i usually like adventure fantasies but this book was just all over the damn place there are plenty of books in which this is well done i didn t feel like this was one of them the adventures felt forced and i didn t enjoy reading any of them i finished the book but i skimmed through most of it because i just wanted to know what happened in the end i kind of want to read the subsequent novels but this is not a good start 
3592,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,i m doing more writing than reading these days and this book was na nice way to relax in between solid but not distracting i ll continue the series 
3593,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,i liked it it reminded me of tamora pierce s novels actually the heroine is a strong female called to do some great deed there s a sprig of romance not a main theme but it s not minor either has the perfect blend of fantasy and adventure and keeps its readers turning the pages all in all it was wonderful 
3594,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,swords and sorcery coming of age adventure action magic creatures of myth and legend dark magic evil power hungry bad guys magical horses kidnappings betrayals triumphs defeats any of that sound good then you should read this book it truly had a bit of everything it s quite a long story but the pacing was pretty consistent and fast throughout i instantly felt comfortable in the world building it was very easy to acclimate to i have read a few swords and sorcery type books but n
3595,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,originally posted at fantasy literature ride greenie ride karigan g ladheon the daughter of a wealthy merchant has been kicked out of school because she beat up the son of a nobleman on her way home she crosses paths with a green rider one of king zachary’s messengers the rider has two black arrows in his back but before he dies he coerces karigan into promising to take a sealed message to the king reluctantly karigan sets out to fulfill her vow along the way she meets allies and en
3596,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,it reminded me of the lord of the rings somewhat with its eletians elves groundmites orcs abram rust ent and the ghosts the shadow host but overall it is a different world with different characters it s more a coming of age story than a full blown fight of good versus evil with the heroine karigan having just left school i enjoyed the adventure and the characters even if some of my favourites were just secondary like the berry sisters and the horse the mysterious group of the
3597,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,the book gets off to a slighlty awkward start but it soon speeds up and eventually you can t put the book down the plot captures your attention at just the right moments and the characters constantly surprise you the book is about a girl called karigan who upon being thrown out of her school finds one of the king s green riders with two arrows in his back making a promise and accepting a life that she underestimates she embarks on an adventure which leads her to immense danger to the mys
3598,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,num num stars this was so much fun even though green rider was released in the nums it still gave me nostalgia for old school fantasy novels there s just something so damn classic about a protagonist who runs away and straight into adventure although i really enjoyed this book unfortunately i cannot recommend ellen archer s audio narration it legit sounded like siri was reading the book aloud stick to the print version full review to come 
3599,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,it took me a bit to get into this book but ultimately i loved it and plan to read the others her world is fascinating and the adventure is gripping i could have done without the weirder names someone named f ryan coblebay works with a woman named joy overhill for instance which were jarring at times it s robert jordan syndrome all over again but truly a ripping good read 
3600,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,though the pacing lagged at times the ending mostly made up for it and karigan finally started doing things for herself i ll most likely keep reading the series more thoughts to follow in this month s subplots and storylines blog post 
3601,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,green rider was exactly what i was looking for when i went searching for nums style epic fantasy and i m very happy with my experience i m excited to finish the book and will absolutely be continuing with the series full review https //www patreon com/posts/first g 
3602,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,it may contain the elements of your typical fantasy/adventure story but i think we can all commend kristen britain for doing it the right way i love our spunky main character the horse and the people she met along the road so many things happened it s actually quite a long book but surprisingly i flew through it how i wish that i had read this during my early teenage years i really enjoyed this 
3604,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,the first impression one gets from reading the back cover of green rider is the obvious parallels to the heralds of valdemar series by mercedes lackey both involve messengers of the regent special horses and magic and while there are some similarities britain s book reads with less magic and more grit and politics the world is rougher more dangerous the land of the story is broken into clans much as europe was broken into multiple kingdoms fiefdoms etc several centuries ago clans wh
3605,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,expect spoilers the beauty of this book at least for me is that i am still newly venturing into the world of fantasy so the novel was original the magical world was quite intriguing and the bad guys weren t completely expected karigan is a lovable character i wanted her to succeed and since i know this book is just one in a series of at least num books i know in the back of my mind that she will succeed f ryan coblebay man i really like this character does it say something about me
3606,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,holy book lords does this woman need an editor i bought the audiobook version of this novel and immediately questioned why i d liked it so much on the first reading other reviewers are right in saying that the book very much resembles mercedes lackey s valdemar series since the basic premise is the same magical horse connects with rider who is bound to it but there is more death and gloom and nonsensical plot devices here nevertheless some of the culture of the riders was appealing and i
3607,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,num num stars rounded down to num the vibe i get from this book is very similar to the one i get when reading the hobbit it s a light hearted whimsical tale and a fun read i love the main character s bond with her horse as it is very similar to the bond a rider has with her horse in the real world britain really captures the trust and love that exist between a girl and her horse i would have given this book a higher rating but i m not sure if this book is for everyone even though i enjoyed it
3608,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,i bought this book during a stay in london in num the blurb was like an invitation to me i like books with a heroine and to be honest i really love karrigan and her story i also like the authors writing style fortunately there are two more books second volume is on my to read list and third volume is on my to buy list it s really interesting that uk and us pocket books are a lot cheaper when i buy them in germany ok maybe one reason is exchange raate of euro 
3609,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,i really enjoyed this book my only issue was that the pacing in the early chapters was off and made the book sag but once she reaches the city and delivers her message about num through the book the plot doesn t stop to take a breath 
3610,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,will review upon a re read 
3611,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,i didn’t know where the book was going to go by the cover i thought she would be getting with the character who turned out to be the gray rider whoops then i thought she would get with the green rider even though he died i thought they would get together he was a few years older than her so i thought that was such a shame and i didn’t like that he was sending a love letter to lady estora and planning to get married his name is f’ryan coblebay and i really didn’t like it it was a dying
3612,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,well all i can say is that i m glad i read this from the library and didn t buy it myself to be honest this one was a case of blatant cover love i skimmed the synopsis and just dived right into this one hoping it would be good it started off okay but we kind of went down hill as the story progressed it turns out this was really not for me it might be for those who like heavy dense fantasy it isn t that i don t like heavy fantasy but this had no emotional depth in it and if i m goi
3613,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,why i chose this book i wanted to read some classic fantasy this year and several of my friends said they enjoyed this one rating/content i give this book num out of num stars this book is not exactly young adult but the main protagonist is a teenage girl she reluctantly takes over the mission of a green rider messenger to the king and the first half of the book follows a fairly traditional fantasy quest progression the second half of the book is basically about overcoming the bad guy’s plans t
3615,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,i m going to try this again in a few years but for now the plot seems too childish to me aspiring so hard to be lotr and failing even harder this girl managed to get captured like num times during the first num percent of the book and every time she is magically saved by yet another deux ex machina i heard there is a great slow burn in those books but judging by what transpired until now i m not convinced it will be done right at all 
3616,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,actual rating num num i enjoyed this book i think it just fell short in some areas and was a little predictable in the sense of sticking to some fantasy stereotypes in saying that i did enjoy it i thought it was quite light for a fantasy book and the character developments were really good i liked the way magic was used as in each rider had a specific skill also i really loved the old sisters in the wood they were my favourite part of the story i will definitely read the next one 
3617,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,for me this took a little while to get into but once it got going i really enjoyed it i love the strong female lead and the use of magic the story was really good and i m excited to see where it goes there were so many good characters in it that it kept things really interesting you can see the inspiration from classic fantasy but i liked the way it was written so it didn t bother me the way it has in some other books i m looking forward reading the rest of the series 
3618,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,a competent fantasy novel which i think would definitely appeal to the young adult audience a little bit under developed both in character and story line for my taste but i may try the next in the series to see how it progresses as there is certainly potential for growth 
3619,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,pretty standard fantasy i think i would have liked it more if i read it when i was younger a lot of it feels like our hero is on a conveyor belt of adventures without any particular agency in the process 
3620,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,if you grew up reading the fantastic lioness quartet by tamora pierce like i did then this series is sure to reignite your love of fantastical worlds and badass heroines the series follows karigan as she traverses across sacoridia as one of the king’s green riders couriers of the kings most important messages and letters gifted with the ability to disappear through time and space she saves the king and sacoridia numerous times with both skill and ingenuity as we as readers learn more about
3621,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,for some reason i wasn’t that excited about starting this book i don’t know if it was the cover or the fact that i couldn’t find any reviews that mentioned any kind of romance in the story i know that is a lame reason not to read a book but i just can’t help but love a good romance in my books despite the lack of romance i actually ended up really liking this book i thought karigan was an amazing spunky girl she is not the type to take no for an answer and she never gives up whether she
3622,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,i actually bought this book years ago i found it at a local flea market and it sounded appealing even though i knew nothing about the book or author i set it aside and read a few reviews of it that made the book sound dreadfully boring and pretty much erased my interest in it fast forward until a couple of weeks ago i was looking at reviews at this very website for books that i was interested in and i thought about this one i still had my sightly battered copy of green rider sitting on my s
3623,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,i really enjoyed this one it reminded me of things i read when i was younger num s a good blend of modern fantasy and post tolkienesque fantasy i will definitely be picking up the next book of the series in the future read this if you have tried jeff wheeler s kingsfountain books they have the same borderline juvenile voice/vibe 
3624,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,i grabbed this book at b n because it had a horse on the cover and sounded interesting i was at an event for my son s school and they got a percentage of all sales so i felt obligated to buy something but didn t want to spend more than num so at num num green rider was one of the best book prurchases i ve ever made i was hooked from the start the book is fast paced and packed with magic which i love britain takes you into the story and make you feel like you re there riding alongside
3625,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,num num stars a good start to a traditional type fantasy series nothing new or revolutionary here just good old hero/quest/coming of age fantasy this has been on my radar for a while and i m glad i finally picked it up last month i was looking for an old school traditional fantasy read but i decided to pick up the baker s boy instead of this i was less than impressed by bb but i m happy to say that i found what i was looking for with green rider like i said nothing revolutionary but i
3626,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,extremely well written book especially considering that it is the first by the author the book introduces are heroine karigan into an unenviable position of having to carry a riders message on to it destination while facing a force that is out to stop her sounds pretty straight forward a task as the book continues though the situation escalates until the entire kingdon is threatened indeed things are not completely resolved at the end of the first book it may be looked at as the first battl
3627,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,enjoyable high fantasy that straddles the fence between ya adult while it lurches somewhat awkwardly at times the story arc is engaging the characters are good company with room to grow in future books there s a rather blatant sense of tolkien at certain points i ve got no issue with that it s difficult to write this genre without some similarities but i do think the book is strongest when it forgets to pay homage instead spreads its own wings as something different from
3628,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,the story is nothing much new but there s a surprising whiff of fresh air to it mostly due to the characters i think i liked the heroine she came close to being cookie cutter here and there but for the most part britain makes an interesting refreshingly flawed character out of all the cliches she was unapologetically belligerent had enough bad judgment to be real and by the end it felt like she d grown up a little rather than perfect all along and simply misjudged the final battle see
3629,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,i found this book on the floor of my friends room and started reading it for want of something to do when the time came for me to go home she let me take it with me as i was so engrossed in the story we start with karigan expelled from school stumbling across a dying green rider and she is shoved into the role of the heroine right away as the rider begs her to carry on his mission yes there are a lot of similarities with other books there is magic special abilities and a threat to the
3630,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,two and a half stars not that it was bad but i just couldn t get myself to care and dnf at almost the end of the book i think view spoiler [ the death of the king s dog hide spoiler ] did it for me otherwise i found all the characters lacking in depth and all the situations already seen or read somewhere else sad that the most colorful and vivid characters of the book was the ghost ok i m kidding it was the swords woman working for the bad side so if you didn t read a lot of fantasy 
3631,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,for a debut fantasy novel i found this to be a very entertaining and engaging read karigan is my favourite type of protaganist very human and relatable but possessing hidden reserves of strength and courage that help her to overcome challenges and adversity it s nice to see a female cast in the role of hero for a change it seems a lot of fantasy novels reserve that role for brawny strong kick ass males tons of adventure and magic keep the action fast paced and interesting i also liked
3632,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,i thoroughly enjoyed this read it has all the right elements of a classic fantasy written with a flowing style and a great cast of characters it is obviously an opener to a much bigger story that i am looking forward to continuing side note this a clean read free of obscenities or sex i found it refreshing magical and a lot of fun well done highly recommended either as a ya or adult read purchase with anticipation of pure fantasy adventure written by a real talent enjoy 
3633,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,i can t believe it s been over four years since i ve read this yet every single time i see it on my shelf i smile fondly and my fingers itch to go through the pages one more time i haven t even continued the series but this is one of my all time favorite books i obviously can t write an accurate review since it s been so long but i m hoping some of my friends here on goodreads will pick this book up because it truly is was a hidden gem 
3634,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,i really like that this story has a lot of leading characters that are female it s always good to read a story where the person who saves the day is a woman instead of a man it s a very well written storyline and keeps me wanting more 
3635,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,this is the first book in an amazing series the plot is unique and engaging this is one of those books that i find myself reading over and over again i am never able to put it down i definately recommend reading this book 
3636,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,excellent high fantasy is probably my favorite type of reading and green rider doesn t disappoint i can t wait to read the whole series review also posted at writings of a reader
3637,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,i absolutely just fell in love with the main character and the story i really can t remember how i came across this series but it has since turned into one of my most favorite reads ever i know this series is not for everyone but i truly loved it 
3638,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,i loved it 
3639,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,look what beautiful covers they give to rubbish books it s such a shame 
3640,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,this is my novel series jackpot 
3641,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,a familiar sort of story with the rare ability to suck me in and keep me hooked loved the plot romance writing characterisation read read read 
3642,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,super cool book 
3643,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,fucking phenomenal what a great book great plot characters setting pacing all of it thoroughly devoured just finished this book again num/num/num still a great read 
3644,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,i read these book such a long time ago i have to go back to them and catch up 
3645,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,oh i enjoyed this so much excited to start the next one 
3646,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,num num stars this is a rough book it didn t grab me immediately and even as i finished the last page i found myself thinking that it felt very pre num basically karigan finds a dying green rider a special kind of messenger who entrusts her with a message for the king she accepts the message and undertakes a dangerous journey to the capital sacor city once she s there we find out that view spoiler [the message is part of a plot to overthrow the king karigan participates in the rescue
3647,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,1,before i start my rant i have to admit that i read a lot of fantasy like a lot i think if i had picked up green rider in my early fantasy days as a teenager i probably would have loved it and raved about it and gone on to buy every book in the series unfortunately while past me may have loved green rider present day me thought it was mediocre at best full disclosure here i read the first num pages skimmed until i couldn t stand the boredom anymore i was literally crying in my fr
3648,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,after finishing this book i feel very conflicted on the one hand it was a beautifully written tale rich with magic adventure and intrigue on the other hand i can t get past the troubling trope of women needing to be raped or sexually violated in some way in order to grow every single prominent female character in the book except one is almost raped threatened with rape or it s subtly hinted in the narrative that they have been raped in the past i understand that the world britain has c
3649,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,i concur with the blurb by terry goodkind about this novel “a wonderfully captivating heroic fantasy adventure this is the rarest of finds a truly enjoyable read ” like goodkind i enjoyed this novel through and through there was not one part of this story that didn’t entrance me it was fun and reminiscent of a beloved classic the “hobbit ” karigan g’ladheon’s thrust into an adventure like bilbo and sent on a quest his task may have been a lot more daunting but karigan sure gets into her f
3650,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,what a satisfying debut novel i enjoyed this book more than i thought i would and i m looking forward to reading the next instalment of this series readers who love classic fantasy will enjoy green rider the tolkien inspiration is hard to miss in this book but britain also managed to make it her own i liked how the protagonist karigan wasn t particularly a chosen one how she came to go on her quest was mainly by chance and it was so refreshing that she wasn t a stereotypical cut out of a
3651,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,remember that time i swore off high fantasy novels forever because i d read several contemporary high fantasy novels in a row that were pure unadulterated crap because i was tired of sexist racist unimaginative fantasy worlds that regurgitated the same old formulaic tropes and plots with little creativity and worse writing yeah i need to amend that resolution green rider despite being several years old and me being late to the party felt like a fucking breath of fresh air this is the e
3652,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,i’m not saying this is a bad book but it is not for me i think my num year old self would have really loved it and if you’re in your early teens or like “chosen one” fantasy stories please by all means enjoy i don’t mean that this book is infantile or that there is something wrong with it i just know that i would have loved to read this in a park imagining that i was an adventurer lost in the woods and attempting to fulfill a secret mission when i was a little younger my current sel
3653,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,back in num a neighbour insisted i read this because the series was her favourite i d just finished the inheritance which was a pretty heavy read and was looking for something fun and relatively light this fit the brief perfectly it s not an entirely original premise or execution of premise and there are an insane amount of nods to lord of the rings plus other high fantasy staples but over all it was very enjoyable and i m extremely sad that i moved away from this neighbour shortly af
3654,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,that was pretty great i picked this one up on a whim because i absolutely adore the cover god what i would give to cop karigan s outfit lol and i m glad i did this is like the definition of fantasy adventure our heroine karigan g ladheon great name is suspended indefinitely from boarding school and she s kind of a firecracker so she runs away to go back home before her father can come get her after a day on the run she comes up a green rider one of the king s messengers who is clos
3655,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,i m terrified to realise that it s been over num years since i first picked up this series it s a testament to the author that i remembered so much of the world building and the circumstances around the storyline stumbling across a dying messenger karigan s only priority is to get home before her father discovers that she s run away from school instead she finds herself entrusted with the dying message of a green rider and thrown into the intrigues of the court while trying to deliver the mes
3656,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,this is the sort of book i used to look for when i was a kid you know after i finished with tolkien lewis mckinley mccaffrey jacques the forgotten realms and some dragonlance scratches head okay so that doesn t sound as desperate as it was meant to be but keep in mind i read all those authors and series waaaaay before high school yep so there s num year old me despairing that the local bookstore doesn t have any more high fantasy/epic adventures to offer very much with the despai
3657,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,an early but easy decision to quit this book as well two dnfs in a row uh oh this book starts out with some action but the writing feels halting she did this then she did this then she did this already there are things that are too easy for the protagonist she s fleeing on horseback then gets off the road to hide and the pursuers happen to stop right there to chat loudly about their plans oh and she has a brooch that grants her wishes convenient after reading some other review
3658,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,i would wish to give green rider num num/num stars this was my third attempt to read it and though it took me num years i can finally appreciate the incredible world kristen britain created as you delve deeper into the story it becomes clear that the author has not created a simple trilogy no the intricate world the depth of the numerous characters the hints of the coming of a great war and the many unsolved mysteries all indicate the start of a long epic fantasy series my inability to put do
3659,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,i found green rider to be an engaging story that kept me flipping pages until i finished it i enjoyed the main characters but felt that certain feelings and reactions were not as realistic as they should have been that is the characters reacted as they did because of dramatic factors rather than being natural experienced readers will realize that this was the author s first published novel but since she has published many more since that time she has improved her style i look forward to r
3660,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,1,it s been years since i read this book and had completely forgotten about it nothing about it grabbed me except the visual detail of the green clothing for messengers i remember being bored as i read it and never looked for more in the series or by the author the main character isn t particularly relatable or likeable and i don t remember her changing much through the course of the book 
3661,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,very classical in a lotr or twot sense without reaching that level in it s build up with an ancient evil an evil sorceror and a protagonist thrown into the middle of it all who then will have to overcome the evil with spunk and attitude and development overall it s a well told story for younger readers 
3662,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,feel good fantasy num with great prose a wonderful plot and a woman main character in an epic fantasy novel i can t think of anything i disliked it was just perfect in my eyes i really enjoy how this is shown through the eyes of a messenger or to be messenger that s unique and not done very often 
3663,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,1,if black company wheel of time malazan were real fantasy this is fantasy s fantasy but i can see the kind of impact this book would have on young girls
3664,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,this was disappointing there is a lot of action but most of it was unnecessary it made the story too long and slow the characters were okay but they didn t do much for the story the setting was lovely but overly described a lot of things were repeated throughout the story i did like the ending though i was surprised by the villain and the way things played out also the ending makes this feel like a standalone which i liked 
3665,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,action packed karigan g ladheon has been kicked out of school after a fight with the wrong person the school bully who happens to be very rich she s defiantly trudging along thinking only about she will break the news to her father when she stumbles upon a dying man in the forest his back is full of black arrows and he wears all green he is a king s messenger a green rider and he pleads with her to take over his mission and get this message to the king the message is of the utmost im
3666,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,it’s a strange thing to review a book that’s been a part of my life for sixteen years i don’t know if i’m capable of separating myself from years’ worth of feelings but i also had a different experience this time around an experience that i somewhat regret undertaking i needed a bit of time to distance myself from my re read before i could write this review green rider was a gift from a dear middle school friend when i had to move from new mexico to utah i was fourteen at the time and e
3667,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,green rider is an exciting fantasy novel full of rich characters and intriguing villains and an enthralling story well worth the time 
3668,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,you are taught very early on that you shouldn’t judge a book by its cover sometimes it totally works for you as happened for me when i saw the cover to kristen britain’s green rider my girlfriend decided to send me into this book with some preconceptions of her own but i’ve never been duly affected by others opinions that being said i was left feeling a little as if the diligence put into the creation of the world and the languages was a little pretentious in light of the apparent juvenili
3669,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,i randomly bought this with my birthday audiobook subscription after seeing it at the store simply because i like fantasy and i like horses seems feeble reasons perhaps but a great find this book starts as our heroine runs away from boarding school after a fight with another student once upon the road homewards she comes across a rider in green fleeing with two black arrows sticking out of his back as he dies he begs her to take his horse and the message he carries one of immense impor
3670,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,the first in a series of three green rider is a great fantasy novel britain does a great job of grouping adventure magic and danger in her book and draws the reader into a wonderful world karigan has recently been expelled from school for fighting knowing she will be shamed in her father s eyes she sets off not sure of what to do next in the deep woods however she encounters a strange rider and his horse he is dying two black arrows embedded in his body and he implores her to complete
3671,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,this is the first book in kristen britain s green rider series from daw books and i m not sure why it took me so long to get around to reading it karigan is a student at a school for the wealthy and elite because her father is a successful merchant but after a sword fight with another student an aristocrat s son where she humiliates him she finds herself in hot water so she runs away or rather she runs from the school intent on returning home however as soon as she leaves she stum
3672,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,first off let me say that i really wanted to like this book and for those that really enjoyed this book i am glad but for me this book was a bit of a mess of contradictions heres s why while the narrative is very action driven and well paced the story seemed not to move very far for a num page book no explanation for the system of magic used it just exists at times britain s narrative style bounces back and forth from that of being exciting and well written to that of feeling a bit juv
3673,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,so i m sure that everyone else has a short list comprised of their favorite books you know the ones that you have to make sure that you get to read annually at least well green rider is one of the books on my list of favorite books and here s why firstly i m definitely a fan of the fantasy genre nothing too out there abstract type books but just good fantasy books green rider has an excellent plot and karrigan g ladheon is a very real relatable character in fact i act
3674,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,unfortunately read it straight after heralds of valdemar by mercedes lackey strong sense of deja vu but likely this would have happened whichever i’d read first it’s ok but not spectacular 
3675,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,to be quite honest it took me quite a while to read this book i d seen it around for some time but although interested i never felt quite motivated enough to read it maybe that affected my momentum because although i thought the story was pretty good and the characters relatively strong i was unable to push through to the very end and ended up skimming the last several chapters just to know how it ended again i think the characters were good the heroine was smart resourceful and rela
3676,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,heros and horses on save the country type adventures count me in great start to what i have a feeling will be an engaging series for more details see my full review on my blog by clicking here
3677,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,it s been a while since i ve read an almost num page book so i hope you guys can forgive how long it took for me to get through this one i ve had a lot on my plate lately for the most part i liked this read too though when you re not absolutely adoring a book that can make it even longer to get through i was determined to see it through to the end however because it feels like it has been on my tbr since the dawn of time parts of it were really good and had me gripped other parts made it
3678,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,due to the sort of recent release of blackveil i decided to reread the first three books in the series it s been a few years since i first picked up green rider and those years have given me a slightly new perspective but i stand by my original rating of four stars here s why as many other reviews point out yes it is obvious that green rider is a freshman novel there are times at which the prose is stilted and the plot line is occasionally overly straightforward but it doesn t detrac
3679,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,you know that dream where you are trying to find someone/something or accomplish something but every time you try something happens you have to run away from something have to go around something else someone stops you or distracts you all the while you are getting more and more frustrated because the thing you are trying to get to is very important each passing second increases your sense of urgency but shit just won’t stop happening that gets in the way that basically sums up my feeling
3680,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,decent fantasy nothing to ouija message tolkien about but it won t make him roll over in his grave either i had an intensely hard time caring about karigan for the first half of the book mostly because for the life of me i did not understand why she took on her quest neither did she which isn t interesting to read frankly i wanna read about strong willed motivated heroes who are fighting to the death not whiny teenagers rambling through the forest trying to inject meaning into their
3681,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,every now and then i come across a book that i wholeheartedly wish i had written—the green rider with its sprawling fantasy world magic broaches intelligent horses strong heroine and chilling evil villains—is one of these when we first meet main character karrigan g’ladheon she has just been kicked out of school for winning a fight against a spoiled noble classmate unable to face her father she runs away with only the clothes on her back and a few precious items but when a king’s messe
3682,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,this was a straightforward book with some truly wonderful characters the protagonist of the story karigan g ladheon is a spunky courageous and imminently lovable young woman as the story progresses her strength of character and inherent goodness are revealed the friends that she makes along her journey disappear making hers a sojourn of sorts something that is uncommon to fantasy stories also uncommon is that of the enemies she meets early on only one ends up being a problem for her 
3683,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,if i d been on goodreads when i originally read this book as a teen i would have given it a num star rating hands down this was one of the stories that fueled my passion for fantasy now i ve reread it and honestly i did like it better as a teen there were things i did still enjoy this time around descriptions of the world the pacing most of the time different characters who were easy to keep track of cool magic etc but it really didn t provide much depth especially into the chara
3684,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,in this fantasy a girl who has run away from school finds a dying messenger rider and agrees to take on his task of delivering a royal message as our heroine is a rich merchant s daughter she has a strong body and educated mind but she s not equal to the evil that pursues her and threatens to subvert the king s rule her green rider s horse has a mind of his own which helps though he s not magical i was fine with most of the story but the last few chapters lost me to a degree we ve been m
3685,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,karigan a young woman finds herself kicked out of school and running away to get home little did she know that running away would bring her so much adventure it starts with her meeting a dying messenger bound to deliver a message to the king whose lasts words employ karigan to take the message to the king along the way she meets up with strange creatures people who speak of magic traitors and the mysterious gray one i purchased this book a while ago based on the recommendation from a
3686,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,i bought this book after saving up for the hard cover price the year it came out i was so glad i got it as a hardback this book sucks me in every time i read it which is about every other year karigan is a great role model she s a great heronine and she s interesting thought she gets knocked out a lot she is remarkably lucky but it doesn t really feel contrived except once which can be explained by the general premise of the book not a rock solid explanation by any means but a passab
3687,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,writing this in num about num years after i read it i was recently reminded of this book it was a random pick from the library stacks i was in grad school and rarely had time for luxury reading as luck would have it or not i got bronchitis and was stuck in bed for days as i was recouping i picked up this book it was a refreshing read and i was felt like it was the first time i could remember a female protagonist written so naturally in fantasy novel it was as if it was not un
3688,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,this book didn’t wow me but it was still a fun read similar to novels like lord of the rings where the fate of a kingdom depends on one unwitting person the green rider centers on karigan a feisty young woman who must send a message to the king in order to save the kingdom it relied on several conventional themes of fantasy novels the old evil that threatens to rise again the unlikely heroine that must go on her own journey to persevere and save the kingdom and of course it wouldn’t be
3689,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,if i was to ask you to imagine a standard fantasy pot boiler you d probably come up with something like this it s not bad it s just very predictable we have a young heroine a king a shadowy grey rider heapings of magic and of course a lot of coincidences all the elements are in place for your basic fantasy story all of which sounds kind of bad it s really not though it s just average is all there are points where writing is a little heavy handed and i m still not sure why the author
3691,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,i found this book in a search of available e books for lend from my library the description made the book sound interesting so i reserved it i m really glad i did this book draws you in from the beginning and you ll have a hard time putting it down the story is intricately woven with many layers the only thing i had trouble with was the age of the main character when i started the book i thought she was about num but after reading the book i think she s closer to num or num i wish the au
3692,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,while all the sword and sorcery wizards and kings chosen ones and magic items are fairly middle of the road epic fantasy stuff the main character shines bright throughout first she stumbles into the whole plot because she was going as fast as she could trying to get home before the mail so her dad can at least hear her version of why she got expelled before he gets the letter from the school she does the standard i m no chosen one the magic dohickey must be wrong speech but instead of
3693,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,not a bad little epic fantasy book has some fun moments a plucky heroine and so on suffers from some pacing issues especially near the beginning not a bad ending but like the whole book wanders around a bit probably the biggest issue i have with this one is that there are too many adjectives and adverbs at play in the prose a stringent edit could have tightened it up a bit more some leeway has to be given because it s epic fantasy and it s a first book leeway given that said a few
3694,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,i just loved this little story what a gem of a book i simply can not figure out how i ve missed this one it s got some lord of the rings taste in there not that i would hold it on the same plane as that at all with a heroine you can root for characters you can love hate adore and feel loathing for it s very quick paced which i loved but there are also times when the descriptions dragged on this would be my only complaint a little overly descriptive but i think that was only bothers
3695,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,the book is well written the heroine was a teenage girl with teenage attitude only doing what needed doing when all other choices were removed it was this which created most of the adventure in the novel the story begins with her being suspended from school and trying to reach home before the notice of her suspension she meets a messenger who has been shot in the back with two black arrows and as he is dying he enlist karigan to finish his task for him she meanders through the kingdom meeti
3696,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,i remember picking this one up in my massive boomerang books order simply because of a few good reviews on amazon and you know what it s actually really good i m a sucker for the no good kid is actually surprisingly good at this one thing and wows everyone at it mercedes lackey is infamous for that type of plot and i fall for it every time my memory is so great i don t even remember the name of the main character d karigan yay for google karigan is running away from school when she s
3697,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,i really liked this book though i probably would have liked it more if i could have read it faster things kept getting in the way i m excited about the potential of the story there s so much to this world i found the whole idea of green riders very unique there were a few times when i thought the plot could move a bit quicker or maybe not have so many details but for the most part the story moved along at a good pace i liked the characters but i don t love any of them yet even karrigan 
3698,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,pretty generic fantasy novel it had some beautiful turns of phrase but the majority of the writing was average magic system seems to have depth but is the type that can never be fully explained and thus never fully utalized by the protaganist the character development of the protagonist is weak but some of the supporting characters and villans are deep and realistic it is a fast read almost too fast one event blends into the next with little if any transition i haven t decided wether i
3699,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,my husband introduced me to britain s green rider and i am so glad he did britain has created a wonderful heroine without making her an unnatural female of her time so many female protagonists are unnaturally stubborn or strong willed for their fictional world but karigan is not only a brilliant heroine but fits within the world she lives in as a strong independent female this book and the one following are a little choppy in changes of perspective in character this failing improves great
3700,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,i m not much of a fantasy fan but my sister swore to me that if i read this book my long drive to utah would go by really fast she was right it did i got to the library as soon as i got home to get the numnd and numrd in the series for me it was one of those books where i didn t want to do anything but read and read bed time could not come soon enough and as soon as my kids were in bed i was reading a great escape the only sidenote i will add is the other takes her time with the series so wh
3701,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,a re read i first read this when the book was first released nearly sixteen years ago also wtf how has it been that long and remember loving it though i recognized at the time that it was obviously very heavily influenced by mercedes lackey s valdemar books re reading this that has not changed and through adult eyes rather than teenaged ones i can also see the flaws apparent in the writing the plot is contrived and the main character is less a character and more an agent of the plot 
3702,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,it took me a long time to get into this story and connect to the main character if i hadn t been reading this for book club i would not have finished it there is not nearly enough character development in the first half of the book for me to understand or like karrigan who comes across as very immature and uninspired the fantasy is pretty basic and light and reminiscent of classic fantasies like tolkien although i eventually came around to karigan i didn t find the writing world or chara
3703,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,i didn t expect to like this book much having it be some dusty slightly yellowing pages that my mother dug up from the basement but the book was great i really got sucked into the world and the whole thing was very believable and realistic it wasn t much longer after that i was digging into the second book and begging my dad to pick up the fourth one once i d reached the third because it had already come out that month the book was amazing and it only gets better throughout the rest of
3704,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,reminds me a little bit of mercedes lackey s herald series in that there is a special bond between rider s and their horses but there is also the element of special magical talents with certain rider pins this is a fun fantasy novel that i had no problem getting caught up with my favorite part was when karigan meets two old ladies in the woods exciting adventure oh and there is now a second book someone reviewed here that they wished there was one first rider s call 
3705,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,i read this book a few years ago along with the second book the third just came out this year so i decided to read them again this book is full of adventure and struggle i love the main character karigan and how she struggles against becoming a green rider but always ends up helping her kingdom by taking on the role without meaning to it is a great series and i will hopefully get onto the second book so i can read the newest edition of karigan s adventures 
3706,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,i tried to read this book many many years ago and gave up on it something about it called to me again so i thought i d give it a try i am so glad i did the first time i tried to read this i was obviously not in a mindset for fantasy but this second time around i loved it sure there were some predictable elements but i found this book to be captivating fun and exciting in fact it s one of the few books that i honestly could not put down 
3707,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,i bought this book mostly beacuse i liked the cover also the name karrigan the protagonist appealed to me i thought i had made a terrible mistake when i first started reading since i couldn t quite get into it the writing style was not quite right somehow i kept at it though found the groove of the style and was pleasantly surprised to have found a pretty good book this one is good stuff 
3708,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,while the writing style was not particularly literary i suppose could be considered a bit elementary to some and the world was perhaps not the most unique or deeply imagined kingdom this book was thoroughly enjoyable kept me turning the pages had all the ingredients of a good fantasy fairy tale castles kings brave girl and her horse a hint of romance lots of magic a dangerous quest i will definitely continue on the sequels 
3709,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,meh marysue heroine unclear writing are groundmites bugs why do they have shields if they aren t bugs what are they and way too many plot digressions there was just no sense of urgency in the writing times when the tension should be high suddenly the heroine is having tea or sweeping a cabin or something there was a lot about this book that i wanted to like but i ended up having to force myself to finish it disappointing 
3710,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,this book was really entertaining for some reason i had trouble getting invested in the more actiony scenes and i never felt like i got a good grasp of most of the characters but i ended the book wanting to read the next one and see where the story goes so yeah i liked it but also it kind of just made me want to reread the alanna books by tamora pierce instead same feel better writing in my opinion 
3711,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,apparently i have a much higher tolerance for high fantasy if i m listening to an audiobook because i was never able to get into this book until i tried the audio it s the favorite book of a good friend of mine though so i was determined great world building intriguing plot good action sequences interesting characters and fun num stars for now but i might bump it up later as the book sits with me for longer 
3712,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,this is probably my most repeatedly read book i think i first read it in seventh or eighth grade and it s one of those books that i read about every year i just like the main character and the story is pretty normal/predictable but in a lovable way can t describe its appeal exactly but i like it a lot i just read this one again on my way home to iowa this year in january 
3713,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,low side of num stars i found the story s lack of sophistication disappointing the author is not as good as tamora pierce anne mccaffery or mercedes lackey at plotting characterization or world building the story was very linear and the enemies straightforward probably would not have cared as much when i was younger and it still better than a lot of modern ya 
3714,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,i read this book again after almost num years i had read it as a teenager several times and loved it i reread it because i recently discovered the rest of the series i was just as enthralled as the first time i read it good writing and a fantastic story line made me feel like a a young girl again 
3715,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,1,i think i struggled about num pages into this that was about num pages too many i hate to trash what i believe is a first novel by someone who s clearly trying hard but this was just really a poor book i don t think that anybody in our book club made it more than about num/num way through the book 
3716,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,as a lover of fantasy novels i ve picked this book up a handful of times in bookstores but i ve never went for it i now see i was stupid what a wonderful book an easy interesting read i now have a new favorite fantasy series to add to my bookshelves and i m very excited to continue on with karigan 
3717,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,green rider oh sweet green rider my best friend has been recommending this series to me for num years and i finally got around to reading the first one i cannot believe that i waited this long i kinda want to kick myself for waiting i m glad that i bought all num books because i m starting first rider s call right now highly recommend this series 
3718,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,somewhere on amazon i saw this recommended looked interesting got it out of the library the beginning was thoroughly mediocre i ve seen better amateur fiction on line i started skimming through it and the story picked up a bit to the point where it was entertaining enough though not particularly original in any way i doubt i ll be seeking out the author s other books 
3719,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,this book is a pretty standard fantasy novel that i read when i was younger and has stood the test of time pretty well apart from a few fantasy tropes that seem a bit too familiar it has an engaging plot and enough interesting well rounded characters to make up for the few bland ones i found out that there were sequels to this book way after the fact and i look forward to reading them next 
3720,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,interesting it took me a while to get into it but then the action/treachery and intrigue got the better of me karigan is a fabulous female protagonist and i m keen to see what her next step is in life king zachary was wonderful but i wanted to know more a lot of the characters grab you straight away i ll certainly read the rest of the series 
3721,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,i don t know if i missed the point of this book or not but i found it fairly uninteresting and well incomplete i read the last word and thought uhh okay what was the point of reading that so yeah not too thrilled if somebody can explain to me the clever subtleties i missed maybe i ll change my mind 
3722,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,so i wrote a review for this when i read it but accidentally deleted a whole bunch of reviews when i was reorganizing my shelves so i guess i just have to read them all again so i can give accurate reviews d
3723,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,a lot of fun really more like num num stars not up there with the absolute best fantasy but as something i picked up in an airport because i was burnt out on school type reading it was very enjoyable and definitely scratches the typical fantasy novel itch 
3724,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,one of the best books that i have ever read lots of fun and adventure the beginning starts out a little slow and simple but it picks up after that magic adventure quest well written drop of romance really entertaining and good read 
3725,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,this story is just as good the however the many th time around as it was the first time i read it almost num years ago this book remains my all time favorite and at the top of my recommendations list karigan and company never cease to pull me in and take me on a wild ride 
3726,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,num num not quite a full num stars but i enjoyed it more than num stars exactly the kind of book i enjoy most and with several in the series already published so nothing to wait for plus lots of horses and magic 
3727,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,this is a book about a heroine who finds herself in an adventure she never expected so it s a learning experience for her as well as for the reader i enjoyed the world kristen britain created and hope to visit it again in the sequel 
3728,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,y all know how much i love a good fantasy novel and green rider certainly delivered some elements reminded me of george rr martin and other pieces reminded me of mercedes lackey but have no doubts britain has her own unique voice 
3729,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,i really enjoyed this book though it took me a few pages to really get hooked however karigan is a well rounded character and i liked how it ended i am definitely going to read the other books but this one could be a stand alone 
3730,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,woo finally finished i read this book mostly during my lunch break at work i really enjoyed it the main character was relatable the action was intense at some points and i never felt like the plot line dragged i have already bought the second book and plan to start reading it soon 
3731,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,i really enjoy this series the characters are realistic the plot intriguing and thoughtful the universe is fantasy based with no technology there is a bit of magic that is intwined with the series 
3732,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,i really enjoyed this book there is a lot of action and magic the main character gets in the middle of a rider sending a message to the king or is she chosen seems to be that she was chosen to be a rider even though she denies her quest i can t wait to read the next book 
3733,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,i really wavered back and forth between whether i should rate this num or num stars the story was interesting but i think the main character was a little undeveloped num pages and i don t feel like i really knew her basically i finished the book feeling vaguely unsatisfied 
3734,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,i ve been meaning to read this for a while now and i did enjoy it but parts of it dragged on also king zachary is a creeper and i don t like it please do not describe how aged he seems and then cause him to flirt with the young heroine really just don t 
3735,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,absolutely loved every aspect of this book couldn t put it down once i started it aspects of action romance fantasy and amazing descriptions made this book awesome 
3736,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,oh god apostrophes that is not the only criticism i have of this book but it s an important one to note 
3737,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,couldn t help but think this was very like tamora pierce it was abit slow to get into but when i did wow awesome book
3738,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,was hoping to find a fantasy series that would grab me think this one may succeed first rider s call already waiting on my shelf 
3739,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,i loved this book it was very well written and i found it really hard to put down 
3740,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,1,i believe i tried to read this when i first moved out to california c num num i was bored and unimpressed and didn t even finish it 
3741,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,1,he who gave me this book said it was a step or two above mercedes lackey i think that gives it substantially too much credit or perhaps lackey too little pure extruded fantasy product 
3742,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,the details to the story were a little fuzzy at first i wasn t quite sure what was going on though it got more clear as the book went on 
3743,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,love love loved this book this is a fantastic fantasy book with intense scenes and characters and a world which completely drew me in 
3745,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,one of the best books i have ever read couldn t put it down and made sure i had the second book lined up before i finished
3746,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,num num stars i guess i enjoyed this a little bit more this time around though the mc can be a little bit irritating at times 
3747,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,it was only ok a classic coming of age tale with a self discovery / saving the world journey with an obvious outcome good for beginners who don t like too much excitement 
3748,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,i liked the horse 
3749,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,a good read i enjoyed it eager to start book num to see what will happen to kerigan and sacoridia
3750,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,great fantasy/adventure story with a spunky young heroine a satisfying read although it is the first book of a series definitely planning to read more 
3751,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,loved it now i am starting the second one d
3752,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4, when you aren t committed to the outcome of the game there is no way you can win this book has been sitting unread on my shelf for quite a while now and i feel very badly for not having cracked it open sooner it was a very good read the story follows a young woman named karigan g ladheon fleeing her school after having been expelled for supposedly instigating and then taking part in a brawl as she travels through the forest on her journey home she happens upon a young man with two black
3753,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,i really want a green rider great coat now i went into this book knowing next to nothing about it only that it had a spunky female lead and that the man who recommended it to me spoke very very highly of it it lived up to it though and i was surprised with all the twists and turns and there were times when i couldn t predict what would happen i did enjoy the little ties between all the characters the chance meetings and how they were all tied together even if they didn t know it at the tim
3754,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,i have some passion for ya as they are called today and this was a more than decent book for young people of any age sadly in many aspects it falls rather flat the plot is quite straightforward and the conflicts and dramatic moments are never really resolved by the mc they kind of put themselves back on kilter on their own and that said our girl karigan never really gets to decide much i fully believe that this book would have been better if the author didn t fall to the temptation of s
3755,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,i was actually initially warned off this book due to the apparent similarities to lotr i didn t see it what i did see was a strong similarity to the heralds of valdemar series especially to the first series arrows of the queen that said no one should write off this book simply because it strikes a cord with another series they are similar they are messengers who act as spies military and whatever other functions the kingdom needs them to the greenies and the heralds both have individu
3756,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,i don’t know how i found this book i’m not generally a fan of fantasy novels but i like the idea of themso i keep trying i usually lose patience with the lengthy world building and confusion of too many foreign names that generally fill the first num pages i must have used the right search terms or found this via another novel i enjoyed i suppose because i did enjoy it there are strong female characters the young heroine in particular kerrigan has just been suspended from her private sc
3757,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,stealing a book summation ffr the book opens by introducing the gray one a mysterious character who creates a minute crack in the d yer wall the wall has stood for a thousand years without sign of wear and would have stood for thousands more years its purpose is to enclose kanmorhan vane or blackveil forest and mornhavon the black karigan g ladheon a merchant s daughter is cast out of her school in selium by dean geyer following a duel which resulted in her besting a wealthy aristocrat
3758,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,this was an ok read for me but not a huge hit for my taste it felt extremely derivative to me especially the first half of the book which felt like a mashup of mercedes lackey s valdemar books and lord of the rings from the introduction/foreward it seems like the author got a boost earlier in her career from terry goodkind and in the book there s a little shoutout to him as the character encounters the river terrygood which made me chuckle a bit when i got to it the plot falls into two halves
3759,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,the last book i remember reading that was as long as this was harry potter and the goblet of fire back when it released and that took me four days in contrast green rider at num and something pages took me a day and it felt like just a few hours if i’m being completely honest i’d never have picked up green rider if i’d seen it in a bookshop at least not with the old cover s i guess it’s a good thing then that i didn’t see the cover when i chose this sometimes the best thing you can d
3760,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,i am so disappointed in this book it s been popping up in my if you liked this you ll like that recommendations for years and i finally gave it a chance and it fell so flat the premise is awesome a young girl karigan what an awesome name takes over from a green rider essentially a royal messenger when he dies in front of her adventure and cross country exploring ensues as she valiantly tries to give her message to the king and fulfill her destiny based on the story alone this is
3761,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,oh i liked this i ve been aching for a fantasy series where a there is more than one woman and b the magical fantasy series actually features some magic honestly it is perfectly incredible how many fantasy books fail to have any use of magic in their pages magic is deserted to some degree by the society in this tale and only certain people use it but the characters we follow including our heroine are among those that do magic permeates the story and i for one say about time i
3762,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,karigan g ladheon has just been humiliated and forced to watch her dreams crumble after she is kicked out of school while on the way home she runs into a dying green rider who entrust a message into her hands this message must reach the king in time although karigan knows nothing about being a green rider how to fight or what is so important about the message she still takes the task on along the way she finds help meets enemies who take her hostage and face danger she never imagined the
3763,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,the good the world itself is interesting britain has obviously put a lot of though into how her literary world works from it s inhabitants to it s landscape to it s politics and even the games played within it the green riders are a particularly interesting group looked down upon by their fellow soldiers for being merely messengers when in reality they possess one of the few remaining sources of magic i was particularly intrigued by the more seasoned riders including one who spends most of t
3764,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,when i read that this book was compared to tamora pierce s novels i rejoiced though some folks compare them to lackey s valdemar series due to the mystical horses the worlds are very different and the way the magic works is very different the pierce comparison is far more astute a well written adventure about a young woman facing challenges and growth and learning about the magic that now surrounds her this novel does a nice job of introducing several characters that i m sure we ll see mor
3765,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,the green rider is a delightful fantasy novel the main character is a teenage girl daughter of one of the richest merchants in her kingdom she runs away from her school after she is suspended and this is when the writer begins to delve into the heart of the story as the main character is being introduced it switches to the view of another darker and magical villain the magic of the book is not explained well but the author still attempts to explain how the villain uses his magic she as
3766,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,this series was recommended to me because i ve run out of tamora pierce s works it s supposedly similar so off i went on this wild ride but alas there were serious stumbles i am dismounting after this book the good the beginning was promising with the hints of magic politics and intrigue i think the horse is a great character and the tropes were familiar but cozy the writing was solid for the most part the bad the second half of the book is where i started to get frustrated fro
3767,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,i really wanted this to be a num star book but i just couldn t quite get there green rider is pretty clearly a first novel which isn t necessarily a bad thing all authors have to start somewhere while i ll definitely check out britain s later books to see how she matures as a writer i can only judge this book for what it is and not what it could have been thus the num star rating first of all the plot kept moving very quickly in this book with enough pauses in the action to keep me from f
3768,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,they say not to judge books by their cover but you could do worse than judging green rider by its art if it looks familiar and friendly a cousin perhaps to mists of avalon s woman on a horse or to the original wheel of time covers there s reason for it this one s a throwback and makes no bones about it if i d discovered this one at the right age as a youngster whipping through marion zimmer bradley and mercedes lackey and anne mccaffrey books looking for stories of girls and women on adv
3769,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,i m kinda leaning toward a did not like it one star rating on this one it was ok enough that i did finish the whole book and these days i am finding it much easier to abandon any book i really don t like even if i paid for it the main thing that made me not like this book was that there were too many saves of karigan by outside forces/characters rather than her being a strong and clever person to get herself out of seemingly impossible situations i was relieved of course that she was r

3771,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,despite of it having come recommended i was a little worried when i started this book and was immediately assaulted by a bunch of well worn fantasy tropes on the first few pages a lurking ancient evil a magical wall a headstrong teenage protagonist running away from home or school in this case etc however the author only uses these to establish a baseline and the story quickly comes into its own most of the characters are likeable and the plotting is strong keeping the story moving at a
3772,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,i listened to the audio book so excuse any misspellings green rider is the story of karigan g ladheon as she rides a dead man s horse towards sacre city to deliver a message to the king she s pursued by the forces of the rebellious province merwell who plan to overthrow the king and replace him with his brother behind the scenes a shadow man encourages the chaos while stirring up old dark magic and plotting to rule the world the first half of the book is a slow slog it s a fascinating wo
3773,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,num num/num the first half of this book all i could think was i should read lotr again because a lot reminded me of tolkien but wasn t quite there i definitely became more invested in the second half and i actually enjoyed the book a lot more than i expected and already want to read the sequel as fantasy goes this one is definitely an easy read which i like because i struggle to get into really deep heavy fantasy and although it does seem fairly typical clever horses dancing elves mys
3774,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,not spectacular or terribly unique but still a very entertaining and ya friendly page turner with a strong central character and story line i m new to this author but found her writing style very pleasant the initial two thirds of the book reminded me of the hobbit a sweet tale of adventure discovery interesting side characters and mild threat a couple of highlights were the strange bay sisters and their enchanting library plus abram rust the latter part of the book was more action

3776,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,this book was hard to get into at first in fact i had to start it twice because i just felt like giving up on it i thought maybe i need to step away and give it a try later it was easier the second time not easy but easier i honestly only continued reading because i knew it was a series and often world building can be arduous and my friend whose opinion in literature i trust actually bought the book for me because she liked the series i had to fight not to compare it to graceling 
3777,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,a very nostalgic read i tried to keep in mind this book is about num years old when i compared the female main character to the current female main character tropes it wouldn t surprise me if this series was one of the founding mothers of female pov i really enjoyed this book thinking of it like that watching and seeing how the female in fantasy has evolved the plot is very classic as well i could call them before they happened however it gave me the happy feels all the same the ending
3778,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,yet another excellent surprise in my trip through the library stacks i picked this one up because of the cover and the first few pages it did not disappoint in fact i immediately went and added the next num books to my want to read list this is a well written fantasy/science fiction adventure that sets up the reader for further intrigue the only thing it is missing is a map which i must say is something that i sort of count on in fantasy literature so that was slightly disconcerting i
3779,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,so this book was recommended to me by someone working at my local bookstore so i decided to take a look at it it did not disappoint honestly this series has me hooked the main character is compelling and i cared about her on her journey the side characters were developed and i can say i can remember them if i can t remember side characters something is seriously wrong have to admit though when i first started reading i felt a little bit of influence from star wars but it was really just
3780,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,green rider was a discount book my husband bought for me truth be told i judged it by its cover not that it was a bad cover but that it was not the type of book i would normally feel drawn to i was wrong what seems like a simple enough story of finishing the last task of a fallen messenger is taken to new heights as the very service of delivering messages is a feat of magic in itself in britain s world a budding power provided by a trinket begins the journey it seems so meager and yet w

3782,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,i picked up this book because i ran across books four and five in the series in a book store and liked their plots so figured i should start at the beginning i would say this is actually a num num but not quite a four but i fully expect the next novel to be a four i see all the building blocks of an interesting world with good characters and a magic system i am curious about learning in greater detail the plot is fairly predictable in many ways but that doesn t mean bad and i definitely get the f

3784,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,i didn t really love this book it took me a long time to get into it the main character was too much of a damsel in distress for the first num/num of the book or so and it got frustrating seeing her get into then out of trouble always with help only to fall back into trouble a few pages later parts of it were pretty corny and predictable i didn t hate it by the end some of the supporting characters were actually pretty good i just had a hard time liking the very childish karigan i m not
3785,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,2,i think this book had lots of potential but there was just too much to make it work the tone was i think what kills the deal it s rudimentary so much that there s no real sense of danger nothing feels like it s lurking in the corner ready to attack when i think that s what the author wanted i was never worried about karigan or anyone else and even if something bad happened the tone made it hard to care the main plot also needs work again a fantasy like this cannot be strung up togeth
3786,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,yes i did have to get used to the world the magic and the time this story played in but once i did it was highly entertaining i loved how animals were theated in this story especially the horses if you are a horse girl and like fantasy you should read this for sure the travelling with your horse is sooo recognizable and besides the horrors the mc faces basically the dream of every horse girl to do once in a while the only issue i had is that i think the story was a bit too long i think
3787,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,one of the best places to find books is by asking your friends for their favourites that is where this one came from i don t know what to talk about first the characters or the plot both were engaging and addictive the story very rarely stopped and i felt bad for karigan and all she had to endure continuously with very little rest it was almost a relief when she passed out so many emotions were pulled from me while i read the book that at times i was grinding my teeth with frust
3788,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,4,not what i was expecting but i was pleasantly surprised it took a bit for the pace to pick up but i was really happy with the way the plot was managed through different points of view karigan was a nice heroine she recognized her faults and was nonetheless courageous good world building i really liked how nothing was explained too much beforehand karigan knew she was naive about magic and politics and other skills and we gradually learned with her however it wasn t like she unreasonably b
3789,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,i read this novel maybe num years ago and i still remember it that s how amazing it was i was at camp and one of my camp mates was reading it and i remember asking her how she liked it and she answered i love it and so did i i borrowed it from her after she was done and enjoyed it thoroughly karigan is an awesome heroine and a great main character the only problem was the next books took forever to come out that i just moved on to other books recently in chapters i saw the most recent bo
3790,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,5,a solid story of adventure fantasy at the time that i first read green rider this was the first book in a while that could surprise me i loved the characters and how they and the plot are interwoven plus i am a fan of good angst and there s definitely some good angst in this series though it doesn t dominate the story or the mc s life the romance is a thread in a larger tapestry you ve been forewarned i highly recommend this series if you enjoy high fantasy of the sword and sorce
3791,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,1,dnf num i m sorry i just don t understand why this book has such good reviews i rarely ever don t finish books usually i ll suffer through a bad one to see if it gets better or just to find out how it ends and be done with it even if i don t want to continue on to the sequels but this book was just so unbelievably boring the main character is boring and the plot moves at a snail s pace almost right after the book begins the main character comes to these old ladies house and just stays
3792,Green Rider,Kristen Britain,3,an enjoyable if rather derivative fantasy adventure i enjoyed the characters particularly the development of the central female the plot was also exciting enough with plenty going on to keep me hooked there were some shortfalls however which prevented me from giving this four stars some of the writing was odd you can tell that this is a first book for example some of the vocabulary and grammatical construction grated on me also the derivative nature of the main storyline and some c
3793,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,1, it s hollow it goes on forever my god it s full of tropes i mean seriously i m not saying this book was complete harry potter rip off but come on it s got an orphan with mysterious powers jealous bad guys who are disproportionately threatened by a child a kindly old man a wizard school with color coordinating robes and folks who don t take kindly to muggles err poor people and yet there was no stew no tunics and no prophecy i m sure there will be a prophecy later after all

3795,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,i was going to put this up on my currently reading shelf but it didn t take me long enough to finish it or perhaps i read more than i check this website either way this book i just finished half an hour ago is a cute little start to what seems to be a simple and inoffensive fantasy trilogy set in a stock and trade fantasy setting with basic characters and a plot you would expect that being said it was interesting enough to make me go look for the second and third books or rather i wi
3796,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,“if this young woman is a natural we should expect her to be more powerful than our average novice possibly even more powerful than the average magician ” this one started off a bit slow and dragged on a bit but for some strange reason i kept on reading as i felt that it would eventually pay off the characters were well developed and the world building great the heroine annoyed the crap out of me at times but i m glad that i held on i really would like to see where this trilogy goes so i eage
3797,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,1,a protagonist that is super special and a world apparently divided into slums and powerful rich magic people i like my fantasy in shades of grey not black and white and i m sick of protagonists that are born more special than other people rather than character development and hard work making them more special so i guess i should have known this one wouldn t thrill me but i was looking for a kickass female magician protagonist and i thought maybe this would give it to me pet peeve canav
3798,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,this book was divided into two parts and felt like two different stories to me part one would be the chase and part two would be the actual story thus i will review both parts seperately part one num stars sonea lives in the slums she and her family have been put out of their homes by the magicians and now they re back on the streets this event happens every year and is called the purge an angry mob gathers around the magicians who are protected by a magical shield no matter how many
3799,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,2,this review was written by manon for rantingdragon com the redundant beginning sonea is a dwell that lives in the slums everyone in the slums hates the magicians that live safely luxuriously and arrogantly up in their magician’s guild only those of the houses can become magicians and those in the slums are regarded as rats of the city without any magical potential until sonea and her gang start throwing rocks to the heads of the magicians that have gathered for the annual purge the purge bei

3801,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,this was a very enjoyable read with an interesting story and some very likeable characters i particularly enjoyed the chapters about magic and entering other people s minds loved the descriptions likening minds to rooms in houses it was all very interesting and made a change from the usual magic books where everyone is throwing magical stuff around and killing each other the ending was very obviously the lead up to the next book and i have no problem being led in fact i am looking forward t

3807,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,i first read this as a teenager and i remembered loving it re reading it now it s lost a little of its shine the book centres around sonea a teenager living in the slums who discovers she has magic powers magic has traditionally belonged to the upper classes alone and so sonea flees the magicians believing they will attempt to kill her in reality they want to bring her in to teach her to control her powers the first half of the novel feels like a cat and mouse tale that goes on far too lo

3810,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,this was better than i was expecting it to be i like my fantasy a little darker than the standard and this had some components that fit nicely into that category a world in which powerful greedy magicians rule the world and keep society firmly under their thumb the setting is fairly stock fantasy and the main character s unrelenting stubborness began to really annoy me both of these issues kept me from rating it higher than num stars but i still liked it enough to read the next book in the se
3811,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,as a first novel it s not bad and while it s enjoyable enough that fact shows throughout the story lacks any real depth character development is minimal the plot is extremely predictable and the dialogue very stilted i get the impression that ms canavan has done a bit of dungeons and dragons playing as it comes close to such an adventure all surface single layer action and no deep storyline there is a little hint of a darker story in there but we don t get to see much of it here perh
3813,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,1,reading through this felt like trudging through mud the writing was horrible it was so dry and lifeless that i had to push myself really hard to reach even a quarter of the book the characters are cardboard cutouts having some traits borrowed from other more successful novels and don t get me started on the dialogue it was nightmarish the magic in this book has no construct to it its just random people reading thoughts and throwing balls of fire no joke the protagonist is a scared little
3814,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,2,i m glad that i didn t purchase the entire series the magicians guild has all of the elements of an interesting fantasy story without the story to support it this took me so long to get through that i found myself skimming quickly just so that i could finish it s a shame really because the idea was great but the execution was lacking

3816,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,it could have been better and shorter 
3817,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,2,this book started off on the wrong foot for me with a contradiction in the first paragraph is the wind howling because of what it sees or is it silent because of what it sees the next few chapters did little to improve my opinion the characters were stereotyped and the description clumsy there were info dumps about how the world worked there were words changed simply to make the world feel different—for example ale became bol and there were substituted words for tea coffee and trouble 
3819,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,2,i didn t hate it but i couldn t finish it the multiple povs worked against it taking away all sense of mystery and suspense you just sit waiting for the characters to work their misunderstandings out knowing that eventually they will it s just a question of how long it ll take and boy does it take a long time eventually i just decided it wasn t worth the wait the characters were all very simple and uninteresting to me they re good or they re bad they re male or they re female but ve
3820,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,i wasn t too thrilled at the first part but the second part kind of makes up for it and it seems like there could be interesting developments in the two other books

3823,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,the first half of this book is pretty boring things picked up in the numnd half i ll probably try the second book and see if it gets any better 
3825,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,this book was a very easy and enjoyable read and i will definitely be continuing this series i enjoyed each different pov in this book and thought they all really added to the story i liked each character and although we learn a lot more about them as the book progresses there are still mysteries about their pasts that i am intrigued to learn more about in future books it was great to read about a society with magic that has a university to teach students completely different from harry pott
3827,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,i would have loved the book a lot more but the ending felt like a cligghanger that was to set up for the next book in the series as setting the stage because of that the book was very predictable but well written making me wanting to read the rest of the trilogy 
3828,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,1,i was not even able to finish this it was so dull and boring there was no good character development and workout on the intricacy of story plot when it was discovered that sonea has magic powers accidently magicians intended to have her with them so for about half of the book she is just running around and hiding believing they intended to kill her as magicians are the bad ones according to story and her beliefs well this is what is completely ridiculous you are starting a book with protagonist

3832,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,the first half of this book is a game of hide and seek which eventually got very tiresome it didn t serve any purpose that i could tell the author could easily have scrapped at least a hundred pages because all she did was repeating herself however once i got past those num something pages it actually turned out to be a nice book i enjoyed it from there on and it has some fine moments but i wouldn t put another book aside for it

3844,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,2,i really can t understand the popularity of this book it was almost bad for me the main problem was the lack of character development especially the heroine s they were all paper cuts without depth or emotions the heroine was a silly girl wanting to escape the magician s guild although she has great power because the magicians are bad and the first half of the book details her attemps to escape them and theirs to capture her they get close she escapes they get closer she escapes

3859,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,a thoroughly enjoyable light fantasy novel good story interesting characters well written i look forward to reading the next in the series 
3860,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,some books are about beautiful writing some about memorable characters and others are about plotting an intricate story line this for me was a plot driven book my interest sustained by the story the writing a means to an end rather than an end in itself it is a book of two halves with strong central characters in the returning slum dwelling girl sonea and the wise mage and teacher rovthen there is a degree of world building as canavan sets out her stall with a city state with an internal c
3862,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,this is the first book in the black magician series i have had this book on my shelf to read for quite awhile it was a decent fantasy book but the pacing is a bit slow and the plot is repetitive i listened to this on audiobook and the audiobook was very well done the narrator is pleasant to listen to and does character voices well i would definitely recommend listening to this on audiobook the magician’s of imardin have gathered to do their yearly purge of undesirables from the inner city 
3863,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,1,there s so much wrong with this book it s not even funny i m surprised it got published and even more surprised i read it through the end imagine if the hunger games and harry potter had a child add some bizarre mutation of bad writing and you ll get the magician s guild all the characters are bland their dialogues are repetitive and shallow the attempt at world building falls flat the pace is agonizingly slow and the plot is like someone trying to tell a joke starting with the punch line
3864,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,5,okay i ll go straight to the point the black magician trilogy is my favorite trilogy ever i ve read it five or six years ago can t even remember exactly when and i still love it all the same the interesting thing about those books is how i came to buy them in the first place i was in the bookshop browsing when i suddenly saw it on the shelf i immediately liked the cover white with a mysterious magician i thought that it was unusual but interesting whatsoever then i took this book
3866,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,num num stars the magicians guild doesn t quite get num stars from me because all of the running around and hiding the main character sonea does drags on for too long i think if we had gotten past this part a lot sooner and more would have happened i would have liked it enough to give it num stars i wasn t real crazy about sonea for a while but she grew on me i liked both rothen and dannyl a lot and i hope the next book gives more character development for both of those characters cery was ok bu
3867,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,1,i always thought that the door to the publishing world was closely guarded and that to be a successful novelist you had to be brilliant enough to shine through the sea of muck pouring through to the editor s desk trudi s characters are interesting enough to force me to buy the second not the third book in this trilogy but only with the gritted teeth and angry soul with which a house wife watches the next day s as the world turns knowing that she could watch all year and she d never know if
3868,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,5,ya fantasy num i really enjoyed this series it s fast paced has an engaging story and an interesting world each year the magicians of imardin gather together to purge the city streets of vagrants urchins and miscreants masters of the disciplines of magic they know that no one can oppose them but their protective shield is not as impenetrable as they believe the main character was really easy to identify with it didn t take me long to feel and root for her the story kept me sucked into thi
3870,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,i loved the idea even though it reminded me a bit few other books about magicians and thieves that i read recently i can t really say that the magician s guild was very unique but i enjoyed the idea anyway book s background is well thought and the author put lots of effort on thinking about prehistory authors style was okay but nothing marvellous and thrilling i guess we all know that feeling when we could read a total nonsense but it s written so well that it s enjoyable anyway though
3872,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,num num stars decent fantasy novel i found it suffered from a common flaw in first books of a series a bit too much set up at the cost of plot i did like the fact that canavan just drops the reader into her world leaves him/her to figure things out with the assistance of the maps glossary provided i liked it enough to be curious about what will happen in the next books of the trilogy 
3875,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,i didn t really need to read this as it turns out i d already read the second volume and there was basically nothing in this that wasn t described adequately there i was surprised at how much of the book passed before the magicians found sonea and took her to the school pretty slow really with more background than necessary i liked sonea and cery and rothen as characters but was kind of bored the high lord who is central to the plot of book two hardly appears in this 
3876,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,2,the author tried but imo failed to create a social class difference by writing too much about how and why sonea hide herself from the guild too much unnecessary writings and repetition of similar events in this book hindered the flow of the story also the author neglected character development although the pace of the story picked up in the second half of the book it could have been better if the first half was more compact 
3877,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,2,num num stars this book was such a disappointment i went into it expecting to really enjoy it but was overall so let down by the characters cliches simple plot and just overall how tedious it was although it did get a little better by the end and some moments had potential but not enough to shine through sadly i m not sure if i ll read the sequel but it s very unlikely at the moment 
3878,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,my full review of this trilogy will be posted on the last book but i liked this it drew me into the story though i think there was perhaps a little too long spent in the same old rut in the slums i got to caring about the characters that i was obviously meant to care about and i hated the ones i was supposed to hate not groundbreaking but enjoyable enough 
3879,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,1,this book is a bestseller why here s the plot wizards exist and they re all noble and all belong to a wizard s guild then a poor girl is discovered to have magic and the high born wizards have to convince her to trust them so they can teach her to control it before it destroys her and everything around her along the way some people are jerks there now you don t need to read it 
3882,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,very engaging strong plot and characters and an interesting world just the kind of fantasy i like i m looking forward to the rest of the trilogy 
3883,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,still one of my favourite fantasy series
3885,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4, how am i going to make friends with these people if all i can think of is how easy it would be to rob them i originally read this book a couple of years ago when a friend lent it to me that same friend has now gifted me the entire trilogy so i figured there was no harm in rereading it and finding out whether i still love it as much as i did then i do kinda but not quite in the same way high fantasy is more of a guilty pleasure of mine than anything else it has certain tropes and identifyi
3886,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,i d read the magicians guild and the other two in the trilogy several years ago but when i picked up the magician s apprentice and the ambassador s mission for christmas in addition to still having to read the conclusion of the unrelated series of age of the five i decided i d do a full canavan reread starting with all the books set in the kyralia universe and ending on her more adult oriented age of the five books so in the coming weeks expect to see weekly canavan reviews with a short
3888,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,it was an interesting story but i found the writing rather dull and boring i won t be continuing with the series

3893,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,an easy read although a little disappointing the premise a society where extremes of poverty and wealth exist and where prejudice ensures that no one from the slums is examined for magical potential and offered a place at the magicians guild university is interesting a young woman sonea accidentally discovers she has magic when she throws a stone at the magicians as they perform the periodic clearing of slum people known as the purge they recognise her ability because her anger dri
3895,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,5,i stumbled across this book series through my friend who is passionately obsessed with everything canavan so naturally as a good friend i decided it was time to check it out okay he said it was a fantasy with gay moments and i was instantly hooked it s hard not to want to get your hands on a book like that good fantasy is exciting enough but good fantasy with gays oh yes sonea is a young slum girl who lives in a world in which magic is real but limited to those belong to the magician s g

3897,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,2,so after what feels like a small eternity i am finally finished with this book finished with what has to be one of the dullest slowest and most disappointing books i ve read in a while i don t even know where to begin with this review my notes on this book are mostly just the same thing over and over again how boring it is how i ve read num num and then almost all of it and i am still waiting for things to actually start happening the magicians guild just dragged out so ridiculousl
3898,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,2,the first in the black magician trilogy a coming of age tale focusing on a girl called sonea a commoner who’s power is so strong she is able to work rudimentary magic something that hasn’t happened for hundreds of years as magic must be unlocked the first novel follows her from the gutter to a minor riot to a cat and mouse game between herself and the magicians and then finally her inevitable capture this book came out clinging to the coat tails of harry potter though offers none of th
3899,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,2,canavan had a good idea that was ruined by the description on the back of the book and the fact that this is the first book in a trilogy lately i ve been ragging on the start of a series syndrome in which the author is so preoccupied with setting up their story that they forget to tell their story from the beginning and the fact that this is book one of three you know that sonea is going to exhibit magic then the guild is going to want to find her that s all on the back of the book t
3901,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,it wasn t that bad but not great either the biggest problem for me was the slow beginning sonea s hide and seek from the guild at first it seemed an interesting idea not to put her in the magic school right from the first encounter took sooo much time and pointless struggle that it became boring i also felt that the protagonist was frustratingly passive throughout the whole first half she did nothing on her own intent and only followed instructions proposed by others i couldn t even tel
3902,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,5,if you loved brandon sanderson’s mistborn series then you will absolutely love the black magician trilogy the black magician trilogy written by trudi canavan is an utterly fantastic book trilogy that i would recommend to anyone with even the slightest interest in fiction unlike a lot of other book series such as my own this series is short and succinct wrapping up with only three books to be fair there is a prequel novel and sequel series but i would prefer to think that those books do

3906,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,1,what a raging disappointment this book was i expected badass magicians and fight sequences and emotion and well basically what i expected was a good book and what i got was a book that is mediocre at best i can t even properly formulate an argument i m so angry or bitter at least do you know it took until page num to even capture the girl a girl from poverty living in the slums was able to outsmart an entire guild of magicians for half the bloody book if you want to read this just ski
3907,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,num num stars a book very well written but which lacks a little something a little anger a stone thrown and everyone discovers that sonea is a magician something that should be impossible because she is not a noble if the magicians guild is torn about her fate they all agreed on the fact that she absolutely must be recovered tracked down in the maze of the capital sonea will have to quickly distinguish between friends and enemies the author s style is really nice the world that he creat
3908,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,1,i really tried to like this book i really did i picked it up because i was in the mood for some fantasy escapism and willing to suspend disbelief unfortunately this book is too poorly written to do the job cardboard characters a flimsy plot partly stolen from harry potter and the dungeons and dragons rpg games a lack of mood and suspense and very mediocre writing make this a disappointing read it s the first part of a trilogy about a young slum girl sonea who discovers she has magic
3910,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,the first installment of trudi canavan’s the black magician trilogy the magicians’ guild is the story of a young girl sonea who discovers that she possesses magical abilities as a lower class street girl living in the slums of the imaginary city of imardin with her aunt and uncle sonea’s life has been one of destitution and hatred of the city’s snobbish upper class every year the magicians of imardin hold a purge during which they sweep the streets of imardin in an attempt to eliminate b
3911,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,it is hard to believe that this is ms canavan s first book the story centers around sonea who discovers that she has magical talent at the most inappropriate time the powerful magician s guild is there to witness her discovery and then pursues her as she escapes into the slums that surround the city the guild law doesn t allow for any magician s to thrive outside of the guild sonea is helped by the thieves but is finally discovered and taken to the guild the guild offers her the choice of
3912,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,this book starts so slow but half way through it picks up and becomes intriguing to the point i couldn t put it down i needed to know what happened i often thought there should be more action in this story or at least not be over num pages long most of the pages did feel like filler i will read the series because i m interested enough to find out the bits that were left hanging in this book what i enjoyed most was the world the author has created i do like to see a world created where the a
3913,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,actual rating num num stars my main issue with this book is the lack of female characters there is one also i don t know if i m being pedantic but the healing arts are the main discipline chosen by women annoyed me more than a little why aren t the warrior arts being dominated by women also the main female character constantly relied on men to help her it annoyed me that she never seemed to make a decision for herself like ever the writing and the storyline were both phenomenal though 
3916,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,a deceptively simple start to a great high fantasy trilogy one of my favorites it s not epic so it lacks a world wide sense of peril and urgency instead this builds the world at this point just a city and characters and mainly sets the stage it s a low key start that might not appeal to everyone consider this an introduction and hurry on to enjoy the rest 
3917,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,trudi canavan s writing and her black magician trilogy in particular have had a huge impact on my writing as well as my reading preferences i read the magicians guild the first book in the series in the mid nums while i was in college working at a waldenbooks store on the weekends and dreaming of writing an epic fantasy yarn of my own i was a late bloomer to the fantasy genre i ve been reading since i can remember but my eyes weren t opened to the sci fi and fantasy section of booksto

3924,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,thoroughly enjoyed it sonia is a sweet character 
3928,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,this series when first published was not released as ya it was later remarketed and relaunched in ya editions too 
3929,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,5,i loved this book excellent story in a beautifully created world 
3931,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,certainly better than priestess of the white it was faster and more engaging add to that sonea wasn t nearly as frustrating as auraya 
3933,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,after lord of the rings and harry potter i found myself in a void of good fantasy books thus i was skeptical whether trudi canavan’s first trilogy was able to fill my expectations however the first paragraphs instantly drew me into the story now eight years and ten re reads later i’ve reached a point at which i can discuss the books’ strengths and weaknesses despite my love for them being a fan doesn’t mean to switch off my brains the story each year the king drives out beggars and vagran
3934,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,5,this book is amazing and the series is one of my favourite series of all time up there with trudi canavan’s other series lord of the rings memory sorrow and thorn graceling realm shadow of the bear empire trilogy deathstalker saga deltora quest jane austens books various historical fictions and last but definitely not least harry potter so yeah whatever you get the picture to me this series is pretty damn good the magicians guild is a relatively short read you can definitely r
3936,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,i feel so bad for not having reading this sooner i had read her stand alone arguably prequel the magician s apprentice and although i did like her book towards the end i guess i was just that lazy to not seek it out sooner actually no screw that i m blaming my local libraries for not seeming to have it whenever i wanted to borrow/reserve it and a lot of other stuff ever in a nutshell sonea with a bunch of other slums kids are throwing rocks at the front of the guild building wher
3937,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4, if i type magician s rather than magicians one more time i ll break something ahem check out this killer of a first sentence it is said in imardin that the wind has a soul and that it wails through the narrow city streets because it is grieved by what it finds there gaaawwwd take my money num num num sadly i enjoyed it too much after that to note more quotes reviewing is hard okay there was a lot i loved about this my only issues were that the first half was repetitive and there
3939,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,sonea is the first slum dweller to have had her magic naturally released this poses a problem to the magicians’ guild and the ruling class for no magicians can live outside of the guild’s rule this fast paced story follows sonea’s journey from realising she has magic to evading the guild to finally having to decide whether she wants to join them or not there’s lots of action danger and intrigue but – having the story told from four different points of view instead of just sonea’s sometimes s
3940,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,there was quite a lot to like about this book once i realised that it was set in a society where the inequity gulf between rich and poor has become even worse than in our real world and that the protagonist was one of the poor people the beginning was well plotted with all sorts of philosophical and economic differences shown between people on both sides of the fence and at that point i have to admit i was expecting a much more complex book than it ended up being a few chapters in it felt
3941,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,2,actual rating num num this is a very up and down for me book it started out good then quickly went down then steadily made it s way up and then so on so forth i don t know if it was the writing that made this one hard for me to get through or if it was the story itself i m honestly very torn about it by the ending of it i ve surprisingly decided to pick up the second book and see if it is any better than the first one it ends with an interesting cliff hanger and the consecutive books will h
3942,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,2,i kept wanting more from this book for something to happen for the stakes to rise for there to be some real consequences to the conflicts but none came the story wasn t entirely bad nor the writing but i didn t feel emotionally connected to the main character or any of the conflict really it was like casually observing a mildly interesting story that was set in a mildly interesting world i liked that it jumped from different povs had it stayed in sonea s throughout the entire story i
3945,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,2,underwhelming you keep waiting for something interesting to happen and it does only at the end and transpires exactly as you would expect the details are nicely done is easy to read but it feels like all there is to the book is the tiny details it s light reading and perhaps good for tentative first steps into magic/fantasy literature for a teenage girl but not for a grown up i think 
3946,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,2,onedimensional characters easily predictable storyline infantile magic but anyway a kind of comfortable read i like the theme and the setting seems harsh not to give it more than num stars but it really isnt above mediocre still i think i might try reading the second book in the trilogy partly because ive already bought it and partly to see if i got surprises ahead 
3947,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,this first book tells the story of sonea a young girl who discovers her talent for magic this being unusual she is pursued by the powerful magician s guild and asked to join this book has all the typical fantasy tropes but a solid and fast moving story you will not find anything new here but comfort in a solid fantasy series first entry 
3948,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,the characters were too shallow for me to truly care about their shenanigans i wasn t sure if i should continue until the end but i m glad i did the plot definitely picked up in the last half but it still wasn t a great plot twist or particularly gripping 
3949,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,5,an excellent book for young adults i loved reading this story of magicians living in a class based society similar in a way to the class based society of a game of thrones and offering teens to contemplate the structure of society and social inequality but without all the graphic violence and sexual themes i also really loved that the protagonist of the book is a young female it s so great to see more of this in literature especially as this is a book i think boys would really enjoy
3951,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,an imaginative world with magic at every corner i read this num num months so my opinion is somewhat diluted as a result i m sure it would have been a num stars had i read it all in a month i would recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy 
3952,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,this was a book/series that first got me into this genre to be honest it does start off a bit too slowly for my liking but stick with it it’s a series that only gets better and is a series i love to come back to time and again 
3955,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,5,still love this book so much that i flew through it it was a tad slower than i remember but i still enjoyed it a heck of a lot 
3958,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,it was a slow read the first num pages but then it became really good
3959,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,it is a lovely series with great magic big intrigues and a strong female lead i absolutely recommend reading these books 
3960,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,5,really enjoyed it might of been filled with some tropes but all the ones i love a magic school someone with great power and a all powerful bad guy it was great fun and well written the first part of the book was slower paced but picked up in the middle 
3961,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,not a masterpiece of the genre but still a fun read the narrative is a bit linear it needs more character development and there is very little world building so far however there is a great deal of potential for growth and expansion within the story the writing is smooth and there is a good flow throughout the book the main protagonists are likeable and i think the book is promising as the first in the trilogy it was an easy and enjoyable to read and i have no hesitation in moving straight
3963,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,care spoilers in review when i started reading this book i had very high hopes i love reading about distant fantasy worlds filled with magic intricate plots and complex characters even better if said world has an elaborate social structure hopefully somewhat reflective of problems in our own society the magician s guild has all of these things and none the story takes place in a fantasy world but you barely explore said world the world feels small and you never really get the feeling th
3964,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,i am very ambivalent about the first installment of this series i will probably read the whole trilogy but there were so many illogical points in this book i very nearly gave up on it altogether there is a decent foundation an interesting world and a promising plot but the execution the main character and the pacing are sometimes so off it’s almost artistic canavan does have a gift for words but the plot does not hold up to the style because the whole book all num pages are more of an
3967,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,5,i have really enjoyed this book as a book intended for young adults i was quite surprised by this book and layer or tow of complexity it has great characters an intriguing plot and a simple but effective magic system i am looking forward to reading some more a full review review will be on my blog soon
3968,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,very good at the start and the end but the middle was quite slow
3969,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,5,i was recommended the the black magician trilogy by a friend whilst we were in school and finally got around to reading the first in the series magicians’ guild last year and finally reviewed it today it was a good recommendation as i have really enjoyed the series as a whole this particular book is not the strongest in the trilogy but it still kept me thoroughly entertained and did not take me long to read i was actually a little surprised to see all of the negative reviews on here as this
3970,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,2,as a child of the slums sonea despises the magicians how could she feel differently when once a year they purge her neighborhood of its poorest and therefore least desirable members everything changes when sonea discovers that she can do magic making her one of the people she most despises when the magicians discover her existence they launch a massive manhunt to track her down before her untrained powers become too dangerous with no place to turn sonea is forced to turn to the thieve
3971,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,3,i wanted to love this book and as it is i rather enjoyed it it was just good enough to make me read the next two i recommend it if only because the next two are actually quite good the main complaint i have about this book is that it had the potential for more it feels as though this is just the first book of a trilogy its sole purpose is to precede the other two books the pacing is fine at first in the very first chapter sonea performs the bit of magic which sends the guild looking
3973,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,4,i liked the books i read all three of the trilogy in less than a week it kept my interest not real intricate but i was looking for something light but not too simple and it fit the bill perfectly it has interesting characters and likable ones and the opposite the evil ones some books let you see in your mind what is going on the scenery the feelings etc her writing did that for me i would definitely read something by her again 
3974,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,1, sonea we must talk to each other he said gently there is a power in you that whether you want it or not you must learn to control if you do not it will kill you yeah sonea you ve seen what your fucking powers can do and how it can obliterate your surrounding but please go ahead and bite the damn hand that feeds you i bought this book years ago by choice because cover looks cool and the premise sounded fun five chapters in i realize its not my cup of tea years later i have to r

3984,The Magicians' Guild,Trudi Canavan,1,i m not impressed i m actually disappointed the magicians guild is a story of magic and mystery there is darkness and great evil but there is a interesting tale and a manhunt here a sort of adventure it has so much potential but it is all wasted all of it well mostly wasted don t get my words wrong but the book could have been better and it isn t it isn t good enough it isn t good as it is supposed to be and it isn t as good as it could had been not good enough the main chara

4026,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,first of all there is a whole lot going on in this novel it is out if my usual preferred genre i prefer to read about real people with real problems while this story is futuristic and science fiction it does deal with the century old questions of power human relationships and empathy for mankind the setting takes place between arizona and northern mexico it prompted me to do a little research on the ajo mountains and salt mines as the author repeatedly referred to them matt the protago
4027,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,5,house of the scorpion was a very good book in my opinion i liked how even though matt was a clone he still tried to live like anyone else would when i read this book i felt a lot of sympathy for him because everyone had to think of him as a beast i felt bad about the process that was done to make matt later on matt is treated better as the book goes on because people learn to accept matt i think the use of eejits is terrible its not fair to basically lose somebody just to get more work don

4032,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,2,this book is exactly why many critics do not respect young adult fiction as a genre it won three different prestigious awards and the writing is barely passable a work of literature this is not the characters are flat and while the story is somewhat fresh the plotting is mostly predictable the ending is neat and sappy instead of flashes of brilliant writing we get flashes of clumsy writing and poor dialogue i suspect it is award winning because it asks some interesting questions about i

4038,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,2,i read this as a possible choice to get a friend who s trying out reading some ya books in spanish as he learns more especially since one of the guys from my ya literature class read it for a project we had to do and said it was one of the best books he d ever read perhaps his summary without the ending of course spoiled the most novel parts of the book for me the particulars of the dystopian setting matt s identity and destiny but i was actually disappointed upon finishing this and
4039,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,2,num num out of num perhaps my expectations were too high but i m quite disappointed although the house of the scorpion raises some interesting thought provoking question about humanity cloning slavery free will individuality agency etc the exploration of these topics lacks depth also the plot is stretched out and the writing is a bit repetitive making this book a rather tedious read unfortunately i believe the house of the scorpion would be stronger without its last third which seems

4041,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,3,for the first half of the house of the scorpion i found myself riveted there’s a lot of tension derived from the collision course of matt’s sole purpose for existing and el patron’s failing health but after that conflict gets rather offhandedly resolved a little over half way through the book the story takes some kind of odd num detour and rounds out with a deus ex machina turn of events and a “huh ” from yours truly if you’re reading a spoiler review then let’s assume you’ve read the book
4042,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,3,i enjoyed the fact that nancy farmer brought up some very pertinent issues through this novel—cloning drugs and finding a sense of belonging through matt’s experience as a clone in opium a place where he is looked down upon by almost everyone the reader identifies with his struggles and is rooting for him to find acceptance the whole way through the novel the author’s setting of the book in a country based upon the drug industry allows a lot of room for discussion about the topic as with t
4043,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,5,before the story begins there was a list and brief description of each character and a family tree which was daunting but the author masterfully introduced each of them and made them distinct and recognisable the story details the life of matt alacran the clone of an opium drug lord from his young age to right until his teenage years for the first few years of his life he is sheltered and has little human contact except with his carer celia an unexpected visit from three children provokes
4044,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,i first read this book in middle school and absolutely loved it it was one of the first books i remember reading that really made me think about the world the idea of revisiting it as an adult made me nervous but ultimately i think it still holds up as a thought provoking story especially considering the intended audience i think this book could lead to some interesting discussions about greed humanity politics etc in a junior high english class obviously since the first time i read t
4045,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,2,matt is a boy who was harvested as a clone at first i did not like the book that much because it was very slow in some parts like when he is in the locked room for four months because of rosa when matt met the original matteo alcran èl patron that is when i started to really like the book because matt felt as if he was a real person with èl patron because all of the servants and the rest of the alcran family had to respect him that part really stood out to me because as long as matt can
4046,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,in the beginning i wasn t very excited to read this book however as i started to get further in the book i realized that this book was very interesting and disturbing at the same time this book made me feel angry at el patrón and because of how matt and the eejits were treated sympathetic towards them as well as the orphans and hopeful when matt decided to take on the challenge of breaking down the opium empire i recommend this book to sci fi lovers and if you don t generally read this

4078,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,5,the house of the scorpion surprised me i picked this book up at the tucson festival of books a few years ago because i heard farmer speak on a panel and the book sounded interested what’s stuck with me these years later is that farmer is of the mind that it’s an author’s duty to basically moralize and teach a lesson to their readers i am not of this opinion and i remember ilsa bick the author who i was there to see saying the same thing so going into scorpion i expected it to be on the pre

4087,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,the house of the scorpion was full of delicious revelations in the beginning which i gobbled up with relish i discovered a futuristic world where humans are grown for spare parts brains are programed to make more efficient slaves and prejudices are based on the science of creation rather than race or religion i found el patron to be the most interesting character and i liked him despite all his evil deeds i was hoping that in the end matt would go back to opium with the same drive to succee

4091,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,5,a great dystopia novel other reviewers have commented on the strengths in the first two thirds the world building the character arcs the pacing the sense of queasy suspense as you gradually figure out what s going on it s eventful and fascinating the last third seems to be a sticking point but i liked it to be sure the last third changes things the setting and many of the characters change even the mood changes the main arc of the book is claustrophobic and matteo feels helpless in
4092,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,3,it was very engaging i enjoyed watching matt do silly things silly but honest and real enough however the scenes are fleeting disconnected the motion here is an illusion like when someone flashes pictures with differential changes it s you who makes the motion that s what i felt reading this hardly continuous enough at least for my taste but i didn t hate it entirely i appreciated it after some time adjusting anyway maybe i expected more because hey look at the three badges of aw

4094,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,5,farmer has a literary style of writing and uses sophisticated language to tell her stories but the house of the scorpion flows easily she integrated issues of individual rights slavery loving those we fear and the effects of extreme power in a humane and gripping story this is a futuristic world where a country ruled by a powerful drug lord separates the usa from mexico the story is about an individual’s journey from being viewed as a monster who was caged and raised without rights for

4097,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,3,this was kind of hit and miss for me i adored some aspects the concept of the book was really interesting a clone of an elderly drug lord is brought up in the old man s mansion and endures horrific treatment and there is a lot of discussion about what it means to be human which elevated it above your run of the mill dystopian novel unfortunately i found the plotting a bit off it seemed that there were patches of huge amounts of action and interest surrounded by long tracts of inaction
4098,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,nancy farmer’s writing in the house of the scorpion well written and is wonderful to read the book is very descriptive especially when it came to the main character in the story matt alacran matteo alacran’s clone matteo alacran or el patron is a drug lord who never let s go of anything or anyone matt alacran learns that everyone is hiding something from him that could mean if he lives or dies i would recommend this my classmates to read i would recommend this book because it is very desc

4102,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,1,wow i really hated this and could barely bring myself to finish it i m baffled at how this won such prestigious awards it was an intriguing dystopian premise which i normally love but the plot was all over the place and the characters were one dimensional and irritating the dialogue was completely unrealistic and silly and there were several grammatical errors that drove me batty worst of all i was soooo bored for most of the book skip this 
4103,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,4,the novel the house of the scorpion by nancy farmer i thought had a good story but got a little boring at parts i felt that the book was pretty good up until he tries to run away from the farm after that i felt that rest of the book was rushed the beginning really grabs the readers attention and makes you feel sympathy for matt i would recommend this book to most people who like sci fi books 
4104,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,3,totally engrossing teen sf clones drug dealing empires forced labor camps survivalism what more could a teenage boy want the female characters are kind of boring and pretty stereotypical but the intriguing premise and the fast paced storytelling made it possible for me to overlook this flaw

4106,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,3,this book i would say was ok it was not to interesting but at the same time it was just below fantastic anyway matt is a clone born from a cow matt is not accepted into the world by most people except for el patron and maria matt later finds out he is not a clone for good but for evil read the book to find out what matt is used for 
4107,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,5,this was one of my favorite books in middle school and it s no less amazing now that i reread it for my class the world that el patron controls in which matt lives is frighteningly stifling yet exciting an absorbing story while at the same time bringing up interesting issues surrounding cloning power and its effect on humanity s future and the definition of identity and humanity

4214,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,3,the point of view in this book is what makes it particularly interesting there could have been any number of people who told the story but to choose the human clone of a powerful drug lord well that makes it readable the main character takes you through a believable series of events in a new country that formed between the us and mexico to accomodate the drug and labor flow between the two countries the point of view ensures that like the main character you re never really sure who can b

4224,The House of the Scorpion,Nancy Farmer,5,i finally did it it took me a year to read this book and not because it was boring but because i have no time and it s a book i actually own so it was taking a backseat to books i checked out from the library i love nancy farmer i d already read sea of trolls so i was looking forward to another good book this wasn t anything like sea of trolls except for the fantastic standout writing and it wasn t disappointing the story of matteo alacran is one of the most complex and yet simple plo
4225,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4, you d better get ready to ride sparhawk meet sparhawk pandion knight and queen’s champion if this were d d his character class would likely be paladin he can cast spells but mostly prefers to just chop off heads with his considerable broadsword sparhawk is a bit of a bad ass so is his horse faran it s the queen s champion don t ever stand in his way i fairly devoured this novel in short order sparhawk has a zero tolerance approach to bs which is immensely refreshing and enjoyabl
4226,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,i ve probably read this num or num times it s fun entertaining amusing i liked this first trilogy better than the second tamuli but both are good if you re looking for something quick light entertaining sparhawk is a great character a battered knight but his horse faran is my favorite it s nice to see a horse as a character more authors should do this 
4227,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,david eddings belgariad series is what first gave me my love of reading especially of fantasy so i always have a soft spot for anything he has written and this book is no exception although i think the belgariad is better i thoroughly enjoyed this book sir sparhawk a knight of the pandion order has returened to elenia after num years of being exciled to find that the young queen ehlena is sick and dying betrayed by a corrupt churchman who has lofty ambitions and her bastard cousin it is
4228,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,the diamond throne kicks off with a bang with the main character returning after a ten year unjust exile at the behest of the new queen with only one little snag in that the queen has taken seriously ill and had had to put into a form of stasis and this begins a quest to find a cure for the young queen d though there are also the parties responsible for poisoning intent on causing trouble which of course leads to all sorts of attempted upsets daring do s plenty of clenched teeth and grim chi
4229,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,the diamond throne is the first book in the elenium series and trust me it is amazing it is followed by the ruby knight and the sapphire rose this is possibly one of my most favourite books i love absolutely everything about it i could write pages and pages on how brilliant this book is but since that would take you too long to read and i would land up giving to much away i’ve tried my best to explain why this book is so fantastic david eddings is more well known for his bolgariad series 
4230,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,david eddings is comfort reading of the highest order okay i will admit that i stopped reading him after a certain point but this series was before that point so i d reread all of the rest of this series in december and all of the followup series the tamuli but my copy of this one had taken a walkabout so i had to backfill and re read the first one last eddings writes high fantasy with capital letters even with all the tropes and archetypes thereof there aren t any surprises h
4232,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,i’m cheating here a little bit because this is a three book series but it seems a little redundant to only talk about the first one so please view this review as being for all three david eddings is one of the great masters of the quest fantasy what tolkien started many many authors have run with though few as successfully or just generally as satisfyingly as eddings the elenium focuses on a knight called sparhawk and his travels to save his young and very beautiful queen who is encased i
4233,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,solid fantasy novel interesting world characters and plot something was missing for me though i couldn t place my finger on what exactly but it was not as good as sandersons books for example especially the dialogues seemed a bot lacking in a way the main character is a great and funny one anyway so if you re on the lookout for a new series and already read through most of the genre this might still be a nice change while waiting for the next favorites 
4235,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,stating this upfront it s not genius writing the characters are two dimensional and perfect they look perfect except for when they have a feature that turns them from perfect to unique they act perfect their motives are noble and honorable except for the villains who twirl their mustaches and laugh at their maniacalness okay maybe not quite that bad but it s close every cliche that could be hit seemed like it was no it didn t wrap up the main conflict there don t seem to be any subp
4236,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,i remember this series very fondly but i think i enjoyed it more as a teenager it s still a good read but the plot is a bit too go here chase clue repeat subtlety is not eddings strong point like on basilisk station the humor is a bit too on the nose the protagonists are a bit too capable and the author relishes showing antagonists getting their comeuppance the story very much doesn t stand on its own which has become a pet peeve of mine and the prologue is a fictitious legend t
4237,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,this is either my numrd or numth reading admittedly it has some of the flaws of most of eddings work the characters are chuckleheads and the plot usually revolves around well i won t spoil it but you can probably figure it out however there are some marked improvements and in the realm of general fantasy it is better than most num sparhawk is infinitely superior to garion num the bad guys are far more interesting than in the belgariad azash is truly something to be feared kal torak by con
4238,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,not the correct edition mine is an old library copy from cassette tapes the sound quality kind of sucked but i ve read the book in paper several times so it wasn t a huge deal this is a simple story a fun romp that doesn t take itself too seriously it s an interesting world with a neat system of magic a definite goal the characters are pretty standard but their dialog makes them more interesting i love that faran sparhawk s horse plays such a great role it definitely ends on a
4239,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,i suspect that the high regard in which i held edding s writing had more to do with the context of my life at the time that i initially discovered his work starved for distraction because this at least really wasn t very good and filled with disparaging and unnecessary references toward women it is possible that this is just the very worst of his efforts but i think i ll have to stand by the past tense held in my opening sentence as far as that high regard is concerned 
4240,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,the dialog in this book is probably the best thing about it eddings has a wonderful talent with snappy remarks and clever comebacks i remember when i first read it reading bits aloud to my sister but thparhawk he lisped you know how thatin thpoths when it geths wet yeah probably doesn t mean much to you but trust me it was hilarious it s a true fantasy novel with knights and magic and battles and the works definitely my favorite eddings novel that being said after rereading it
4241,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,the diamond throne starts the elenium trilogy and centre around the hero sir sparhawk who is the exiled queen’s champion from an order of knights who are trained in magic as they are combat on returning from exile sparhawk finds that his queen has been poisoned and her power usurped by the corrupt head of the elenian church however the sorceress serephina has encased the queen in diamond in order to delay the effects of the poison and buy sparhawk time to find a cure sparhawk sets about gathe
4242,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,reread this book for what may be the sixth or seventh time it s a day read potato chip craving that somehow moves beyond this book has the elements i cherish most it has plot pacing action and character development if you are a slow reader the book may lack urgency sparhawk is a three dimensional character not the best but far from the worst you get to know the first few characters in the starter and the plot presents equally appealing dual conflicts if you haven t read anything by da
4243,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,this is the beginning of a new edding series and i am not as hooked as i was with the prior series of his plot line is ok so far characters are brilliant i love sparhawk and kuriks constant bickering like an old married couple just not as gripped by this as i was before with eddings still good just not great i will perservere 
4244,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,num num ok so it s kinda formulaic but the characters and their dialogues are just so utterly charming i wasn t immune on to the ruby knight 
4245,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,eddings basically repeats the same plot over and over again i m particularly attached to sparhawk so i didn t mind at all 
4247,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,lillias rocks the denouement
4248,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,an exiled knight returns after num years to find his queen deathly ill and encased in magic stone in order to prolong her life he sets out on a highly political and violent quest to rout out who is behind her mysterious illness and thwart those people that would want to usurp her throne i enjoyed this book it wasn’t earth shattering but it was a fun read it was also a fast read i made it through it’s num pages in num hours or so what enjoyed the most would be some of the quotes eddings made s
4249,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,2,on the one hand i want to give credit to eddings for trying to write this he went from family friendly bestselling non tolkien epic fantasy author of all time at the time to immediately a dark and brutal semi noir proto grimdark story about church politics drenched in sex albeit off screen and blood and elder gods and incest and pederasty and fountains of blood and ethnic cleansing and blood and when i was eight i loved it although given his massive decline in sales apparently a lot
4250,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,the most i can say about this right now is first the story is not tied up at the end of this book not in any way i ve read this before but forgot that fact i got to the end and actually went wait a minute what second do yourself a favor and don t listen to the audiobook if you must listen you can speed the narrator up to a more human sound but still i d recommend avoiding it all together it gets num stars because i remember liking it fairly well when i read it years ago listening t
4251,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,num num stars that ending is great eddings writes spectacular characters as always and finally the plot is thickening sparhawk is a really likeable character although there are still shades of belgariad/malloreon characters in all of the other characters it might just be because i ve missed them all 
4252,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,1,read this many years ago and ended up skimming the second half i could see why eddings has such a poor reputation the writing was boring and the characters were caricatures with flat dialog and a generic epic fantasy quest plot i ve never been tempted to read anything by eddings since 
4253,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,not a ground breaking fantasy and definitely reminiscent of the belgariad but it s good nostolgic david eddings fun so it gets a num in my book 
4254,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,i asked someone to buy me this book in grade seven if memory serves i had read and loved eddings other series the belgariad by that point pawn of prophecy was the first novel i ever read by myself giving it a special permanent place in my heart and i was eager to read something else from the guy who at the time was my favorite fantasy writer and the only one i knew which would be why i read maybe a third of the diamond throne before realizing i didn t care and i stuffed it disapp
4255,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,2,it s my own fault i picked up the diamond throne because of my fond memories of reading the belgariad as a teenager in my own defense i can only hope that eddings earlier work was better than his latter despite getting through four hundred pages of the diamond throne i couldn t muster enough patience to get through the last few chapters the characters are shallow the plot circular and the only notable themes are racism religious tripe and the type of avarice which you expect to find i
4257,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,if nothing else i can credit this book and the subsequent series with being the books that got me to really fall in love with reading i always liked reading but this was the book that opened the flood gates it was given to me by a friend when i was in seventh grade and it s safe to say it changed my life so whatever i may think of it now it will always have a special place in my heart that said as an adult it was pretty mediocre eddings has fun characters but they re pretty one note t
4258,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,i have very vague memories of reading this when i was a lot younger but not mush stayed with me i m not sure why as i really enjoyed it this time round sparhawk is a pandion knight a champion of the church and the royal family when he returns to his native land he finds his young charge the princess ehlana entombed alive in a block of crystal a drastic measure needed to save her life while the primate annias is plotting to put his own lackey of the throne and take over the church hiera
4259,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,eddings is an author that i was introduced to in the numth grade i read the belgariad without much thought to what i was reading low comprehension high enjoyment it was the fourth grade years later i would re discover eddings and read through his entire catalog of available works at the time the elenium becoming one of my favorite book series the main character in the diamond throne is sparhawk a knight of the pandion order the pandions are one of the sects of church knights in edding
4260,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,when i first read this in highschool i would have definitely given this book num stars i loved it i thought that eddings was amazing so needless to say this second round was a bit disapointing don t get me wrong i still enjoyed it just not like i thought i would first of all i think i remember the whole series and i thought that a lot more happend in the first book but that is okay because at least i have something to look forward to the story still has plenty of good plot and is a gr
4261,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,my very favorite david eddings book and no surprise here it s also the very first one of his books i ever read this is a great sword and sorcery adventure tale complete with the heroic knight his handsome best friend comrade in arms an ethereal sorceress and the lovely spellbound princess they re all trying to save plus it s got a whole cast of interesting characters and a lot of snappy entertaining dialog the real shame about eddings books is that the great stuff from this book is th
4263,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,cnum nice comfortable old fashioned/main stream swords and sorcery fantasy novel the protagonist has the most memorable name of sparrowhawk and the copy that i read had been well loved and frequently its the type of book that i can read in between heavier books and read with a smile good start to a great series publishers weekly s review contained the words graceful fluid style of storytelling which i feel is a num correct fwftb sleeping jewel entombed doomed exile fcn queen eh
4264,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,i have read this book several times before but not for about num years and i wondered if it had ‘stood the test of time’ the start of the book is a bit like clint eastwood riding into town at the start of a spaghetti western in fact sparhawk has a little of the ’man with no name’ about him the rest of the book is a fairly typical david eddings fantasy it is easy to read with an interesting group of main characters there is always something happening although at times it feels like it is tak
4265,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,if you never read the belgariad this could be a great series however if you started following eddings when he surged onto the scene with the pawn of prophecy as i did you will see that the elenium is just more of what eddings already did in the belgariad and the mallorean it s as if he took all the character archetypes from those books and scrambled them up and re presented them with new bodies and throws them back into the same old plot isolated it s a good read however if you ve read
4266,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,1,this book was one of those ones that reinforced in me the lesson to never judge a book by its cover it lured me in with its pretty purple cover and mention of knights and queens and crystal thrones and magic spells and ethereal fantasy names unfortunately it turned out to be one of the worst fantasy books i ve ever read the one positive thing i can say about it is that it didn t cost me anything and i was quite happy to return it to the library 
4267,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,easy escapist fun i first read eddings in middle school and i still re read his books when i want fantasy with a sense of humor friendly banter amongst protagonists heroes doing the right thing and bad guys who do the wrong thing even though they often feel badly about it eddings best series is the belgariad but i enjoy this one too sparhawk and his horse are grouchy and funny and the female characters are strong and feisty 
4268,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,all possible cliches tropes and archetypes of high fantasy are present in it and its practically a guide for the same however the book lays a solid foundation to the trilogy with its engaging characters amusing dialogues and provides a good pace its super fun read with characters that seem awfully similar yet offer a sliver of their own personality every now and then eddings narration rarely takes rest as the plot moves in a steady pace all in all its a great start to the series 
4269,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,has similarities to eddings other stuff but this is definitely an adult series whereas the belgariad and mallorean were slightly more kiddie interesting world and i m loving the organization and personalities of the knights but i can see that this may get a touch long i was hoping the main task of this book would be completed and lead in to the larger overarching quest but it seems it s going to be dragged out 
4270,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,first book of the elenium just the sort of epic fantasy i have come to expect from eddings the focus of the characters in this book are religious knights similar to paladins some good action in here along with some dry humor 
4271,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,as the first book of a series its great good characters a noble hero and a truly despicable villain yes its a ying yang kinda thing looking forward to the next one in the series and that is the most important thing it leaves you in suspense no other word for it 
4272,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,i really enjoyed this the style is very frank a little archaic and some of the words are fun the storytelling is easygoing with humor interspersed and it was an easy read for me i m gonna go hunt down the sequel now because the story isn t complete without it p
4273,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,http //www segredosemlivros com/num/ 
4274,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,a decent fantasy series by david eddings that pales in comparison to his masterpiece the belgariad 
4275,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,a good smooth quiet fantasy after the turbulent butcher s codex alera and clemens s the banned and the banished eddings is exactly what i needed 
4276,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,i felt like this book was an enjoyable introduction to the series there were quite a few funny moments which i enjoyed and there were some pretty great characters 
4278,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,aaand num hours later done watch this space for a crazy conversational review with tehani and jo tehani i was feeling a little book weary yesterday so thought i might as well start my reading for this conversational review series given it’s usually a soothing experience within a single page i was reaching for twitter because so much of the book cried out to be tweeted great one liners the introduction of favourite characters and sadly some of the not so awesome bits as well i was hav
4279,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,i decided after finishing a re read of the belgariad to re read another david eddings favorite of mine from my teenage years the elenium starting with the diamond throne in this story the pandion knight sir sparhawk returns to elenia after a long exile only to discover not only that his queen and ward ehlana is gravely ill being kept alive by a very costly spell but also that the ambitions primate annias and the bastard son of princess arissa lycheas are ruling elenia in her stea
4280,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3, nature gives neither rewards nor punishment only consequences eddings excels at light hearted tongue in cheek back and forth dialogue an example of this repartee comes when kalten offers an opinion to sparhawk i still think vanion s trying to be too clever about this to which his friend replies maybe that s why he s the preceptor and we re only knights the elenium is packed full of such exchanges another for taste i like talking with whores kalten said they ve got a nice u
4281,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,the diamond throne by david eddings is the first of three in his elenium series published in the nums i ve read that this series has been heralded as a classic by many and was the author s claim to fame i was looking for my next political fantasy book/series when i stumbled upon this series in a couple of recommended lists online after reading a couple of forum posts i ve decided to give it a try in many ways the diamond throne seemed like a good ol throwback classic in the fantasy genre
4282,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,2,an uninspired plot page after page of irrelevant exposition uninteresting characters maybe this book isn t bad but it isn t any good either the author spends far too much time world building giving you so many names of races and countries that you won t remember more than a couple then abruptly rushes into the main story so quickly that there is no time to sympathize with the protagonist or anyone else or even get a vague idea of what he s like the queen he s supposed to save is sim
4283,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,num num this was a solid first book in this fantasy trilogy it s definitely quite traditional in terms of the fantasy genre specifically high fantasy but it s still a very enjoyable and fun read i enjoyed getting to know all of the characters and the writing is easy to get into for me personally there was something missing but i can t really say what i think the dialogue could have used some work at certain points and the writing was a little clunky at times overall this was a fun read and i
4284,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,1,looks like somebody wanted to write his own the black company there is even a weird and powerful little girl companion but well failed good characters are all nice and sweet like each other and always see eye to eye and their conversations are quite saccharine while bad guys look pathetic pimply and idiots main character has finger in every pie and most of the times somebody asks who did this good thing or who will do this well you know who 
4285,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,yes many have said their are parallels between this series and the belgariad but to be honest this is pure fantasy delight with some very funny dialogue between the main characters of the book i got sucked in after just one chapter and ended up reading this in just over a fortnight something i hadn t done in a while i think if you enjoy fantasy have a love for knights and castles are enthralled by magic and wonder then you will be transported by this story i approach the second book wi
4286,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,for a long time i have wanted to try a story by david eddings after reading this one i wish i had not taken so long and cannot wait to read another the story was fast paced and well written while there were no real surprises i still had a great time reading it i kept finding myself laughing the sarcastic wit instilled in the characters was perfect for my taste i would highly recommend this story to all fans of fantasy especially terry brooks and piers anthony i think they will enjoy the
4287,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,let me begin by saying that i really did like this book the only issue that i really had with it was i felt there was a lot of conversation and not a whole lot of action that aside though i eally did like the characters once i started reading i was so invested that i just wanted to know what was going to happen next 
4288,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,this one was a good surprise it started off boring and then the creativity kicked in midway i especially loved the way eddings described each character in detail i almost felt like i knew them the only downside was the way it ended and i have to go hunting for the next copy so i could get answers 
4289,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,this books i absolutely fantastic it s a great bread for anyone who likes fantasy or action there are num books in this series and if you are looking for an engaging detailed read this is the way to go this book is also great if you like violence although it doesn t get to much of the violence until you get to book num 
4290,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,2,i hadn t realised that i d started this before and given up i didn t remember any of it which i m not sure is a good thing it s ok but no where near as good as the belgariad the characters are a bit flat the world not particularly interesting and the plot is mostly padding i don t know i ll probably try the rest of the series since it s easy reading but nit gripping 
4291,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,i m unsure if this series is simply not as good as the belgariad or the malloreon or if i just got bored with the formula by this point maybe a little of both sparhawk is not the most likable lead and none of the other characters are very memorable even his squire wots his name the troll gods were neat but not really anything new quite the meh series really 
4292,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,while i have outgrown some of edding s other series this one and the follow up the tamuli are ones i keep coming back to the protagonist sparhawk is perhaps the most interesting paladin i ve come across and the story is fantastic enough without feeling entirely contrived i ll keep re reading this one every few years 
4293,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,2,cardboard characters with dubious magic solutions normally i like wit and sarcasm but this came across as a pompous western wrapped in arthurian legend should have put it down when i realized i hated the writing style around page num 
4294,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,excellent i wished i had discovered this author before now storytelling that is the best i ve read in a while my regret is i wish i had bought the second book at the same time as i got the first and third strange how it is unavailable in the us 
4295,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,it s been num years since i have read this series by david eddings i only remembered a few characters and the general plot of it really excited to go back through this series book one the diamond throne was full of action drama comedy and heartbreak 
4296,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,good book but frankly i didn t like sparhawk he struck me as arrogant petty and frankly not an inspiring hero i finished this trilogy but opted not to go through the follow up trilogy the tamuli 
4298,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,this series is a fun light occasionally laugh out loud funny fantasy series basically if you ve read david eddings you ve pretty much read this but it s an entertaining light read 
4299,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,as always i find david eddings produces a book with depth 
4300,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,sparhawk was such a fun character he is what made this book so enjoyable 
4301,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,i thought is was a okay book i didn t love it but also i did not hate it i would say to read it if you are into magic and knights and war over all it was a pretty good book 
4304,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,full review coming soon 
4305,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,rereading for nostalgia at the end of a hectic year
4306,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,it s not literature but it s fun i thoroughly enjoyed this book and can t wait to get my hands on more 
4307,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,i felt the need to re read this book series and i wasn t disappointed 
4308,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,one of my all time favorite authors and book series 
4309,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,a re read for me and it still holds up a classic piece of fantasy writing which delivers to die hard sword and sorcery fans like myself 
4310,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,fun fantasy novel with pretty pedestrian writing and dialogue very well built world and society is sometimes marred by flat and uninteresting conversations 
4311,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,that was fun 
4312,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,1,dnf i just couldn’t get into it at all
4313,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4, i m not sure when i first read this book just that it was before my re read in num 
4314,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,this was a reread i remember loving this book as a teen but tbh it didn t really stack up to my adult standards it s okay and the story rolls along quite engagingly but his depictions of women are cringe worthy and i found some of the language made me want to get out my editing pen fairly average 
4315,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,i believe this is the third time i read this book the first being when i was eleven or twelve i was horribly worried that my fond memories of this book and the story would be tainted that it would not be half as wonderful as i remember i am very happy to report that i had nothing to fear the story is just as magical as the first time i read it though time age and distance has helped me understand the book in a slightly different light for starters the world is relatively unimaginative se
4316,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,can t wait for num and num 
4318,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,i ve had david eddings three book series the elenium on my bookshelf since about num and for one reason or another have never gotten around to reading it so when i was putting together a list of books for my num reading challenges i decided it was time to finally knock it off my to be read list the series is comprised of the diamond throne num the ruby knight num  and the sapphire rose num after finishing the diamond throne i m a bit disappointed not that it was bad but it wa
4319,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,originally posted on once upon a bookcase i ve been having trouble with reading lately with nothing quite grabbing my interest or seeming to have inconsequential problems in relation to what s going on in my own life so i decided to pick up the diamond throne by david eddings the first in the elenium trilogy and re read series i knew would allow me to escape my own head and bring me comfort after the death of her father queen ehlana is now on the throne and so sparhawk pandion knight and
4320,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,after re reading the belgariad and malloreon series by eddings not too long ago and re discovering how much i loved those i was a little hesitant to start reading this series because i was afraid it would disappoint thankfully that was not the case at all i felt like the elenium series pace is a little faster than the belgariad and malloreon s which is a plus and this series feels a little more mature than the other two did probably because of the main character sparhawk is a knight b
4321,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,david eddings’ the diamond throne is the start to an incredible series that is very similar in some ways to the belgariad and the mallorean also books by eddings both are set in medieval worlds and both have magic eddings has kept them different enough as to be both very interesting and fun to read as always with his books he has made the characters almost seem real the dialogue narration and thoughts all describe what could be a real person instead of skipping over the menial things th
4322,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,i ve read this novel at least six times now as another reviewer remarks eddings novels are like comfort food thus i enjoy re reading the belgariad / malloreon books and this trilogy i think some of david eddings finest writing is to be found in the first sparhawk trilogy it could be argued that these books were precursors of the grimdark fantasy genre while sparhawk is not an anti hero per se he and his companions blur the lines between good and evil to some extent the material in the
4323,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,fantastic book lots of fun and a great cure for a reading slump also a fantastic intro into fantasy for anyone not that well acquainted with the genre plot story very interesting story but always very straight forward in terms of plot though it has some mysteries and twists those are largely predictable but that does not take away from the enjoyment of the story the end goal is also very identifiable early on and it makes the entire story more engaging since i am at least vag
4324,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,lovely lore magic system but the characters all feel rather flat and one dimensional the good guys are good the bad guys are bad and even the grey ones follow pretty stereotypical tropes goodness prevails throughout the entirety of the book — the villains are always somehow thwarted by our merry band of knights and their suspiciously deus ex machina flavored good fortune eg oh no we re in a foreign city and we need a means of escape without being seen by our enemies wait i have a cou
4325,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,don t get me wrong this book was a good book a solid book a cornerstone of modern fantasy however i can t class it among the best fantasy out there the dialogue is often overly archaic and formal and then suddenly switches to being the opposite there are also more than a few names in there that challenge the tongue and the eye and unfortunately they do detract from the story at times but that s just edding s way as you ll know if you read his earlier series despite these few niggling
4326,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,i am re reading this series for the third or fourth time when one rereads edding s books a lot one notices that the female characters all sort of blend together and the male characters all sort of blend together the stories are still entertaining but the characters are a bit to alike despite attempts to make the characters more individualized he then keeps giving them dialogue that could have come from any of the characters not just the one actually speaking i still recommend this series
4327,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,i remember reading this book many years ago which actually makes me feel a bit old now i m num that s not right and i remember loving it from the start i was definitely younger than nine years old my brother liked it so i had to read it i remember loving it though i re read it a couple years ago after having finished ursula leguin s tales of earthsea series and the similarity between the main characters names from these two books amused me sparrowhawk and sparhawk it made me lau
4328,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,from the author of the garion books comes a series that by my count is a tossup between which of the two series is the best one of the refreshing things about this book and the two series it introduces is that the main character is not the fantasy norm of a young man out to discover the meaning of life during his trial to become a man instead the main protagonist in this work begins the book as a grizzled middleaged knight returning from exile after having a disagreement with the king of his
4330,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,originally published on my blog here in january num the elenium eddings third series is his best fantasy writing to date its hero the grim sir sparhawk helps keep him from the sentimentality and archness which mars much of his later writing and it contains some powerful ideas and a well realised background the story of this first part is concerned with church politics medieval european style in the kingdom of elenia ambitious and corrupt primate annias has persuaded the weak king aldr
4331,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,in my opinion a great book but not quite phenomenal the style of humor in this start to the elenium is on one hand enjoyable and what one should expect from david eddings but on the other hand seemed to lack variation in a way too much of the same manner of humorous dialogue kind of how i think brian jacques redwall books are fun to read but as some others see it the writing and course of events became formulaic and such i did find some of david eddings ideas very cool and interesting 
4332,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,the diamond throne is the first book in the elenium trilogy and the first book in a series of six featuring the same characters and world i read this book a number of years ago and i really enjoyed it then being able to read it again was like meeting up with some dear old friends at the same time… it’s been such a long time since i read the series that there were parts i’d entirely forgotten it was great to be reading a book and saying “i didn’t remember this happening…” what always thrilled
4333,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,2,book one of the elenium sparhawk renowned knight and queen s champion has returned from a ten year exile to find his queen seriously ill and the kingdom in political turmoil he and his brotherhood with the aid of a legendary sorceress must find a cure for the queen while keeping her throne secure as the plot unfolds however they discover a larger evil is threatening their world starts off slow but improves once the action gets underfoot sections of back story drags at the momentum 
4335,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,this is my first book by david eddings one of those authors i always considered but never tried as a kid this is straight up middle fantasy it s not sword and sorcery but it also lacks some of the sophistication and elegance of high fantasy in my opinion this is something of a breath of fresh air after the modern trend of dark foreboding and depressing fantasy still the novel isn t without its share of faults the author s hand is far too heavy causing things to happen purely for the s
4336,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,david eddings just can t fail can he to be honest i hesitated to read this because i loved the belgariad/malloreon and that whole world there and the characters especially silk and i just couldn t imagine anything but disappointment out of the elenium because it seemed so different and grown up and serious of sorts but man was i wrong the style the humour the awesomeness it s all there i loved kalten and kurik and aslade reminded me so much of molly weasley and sparhawk is jus
4337,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,book one of the elenium and david eddings attempt to escape the world of the belgariad and the mallorean i remember back when this book was originally published being excited to see another david eddings book as well as disappointed it was not another series about the world which made him famous today though with a new perspective towards novels i applaud him attempting and somewhat succeeding escaping the trap that many other authors such as raymond e feist terry brooks and piers anthony
4338,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,sparhawk pandion knight and queen s champion have returned to elenia after ten years of exile only to find young queen ehlanda trapped in a block of ensorcelled crystal as sparhawk sets out to find a cure for ehlana he discovers that only he can defeat the evil plots that threaten her rule from publishers weekly eddings begins his new elenium series in a world that has different names but much the same feel as those of his bestselling belgariad and malloreon series fans will find the
4339,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,it s been a while since i ve read a good fantasy adventure story i came into this novel knowing very little about it and ended up really enjoying myself not only did it establish the world very well but it gave some very memorable characters and amusing moments to interrupt the serious tone first i want to talk about the world building which is always an important part of any fantasy novel i like that the reader is immersed into the world without too much heavy explanation i gained unders
4340,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,this was a really good read i ve been wanting to get into eddings stuff for quite some time now and finally decided to begin with the elenium i think this first book was masterfully set up as a basis for the books that will follow the premise is of course quite awesome and i enjoyed the magic that eddings created for his characters i ll be looking forward to reading more of the series so that i may find out about more about the characters i feel as though i only got a glimpse of many of
4342,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,there s always a strange sense of anti climax for me whenever i read the diamond throne maybe it s because the first time i read the elenium i read the second book first and ruined a lot of the plot twists for myself maybe it s because given the pains the prologue goes to in describing the bhellion it s a dead giveaway that this will be the one magical object than can cure queen ehlana or maybe it s because so much of the book is given over to world building but it s really really good
4343,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,1,the protagonist in the story comes home after a long time in exile only to discover that the queen who called him home is deadly ill and to spare time to save her has been capsuled in chrystal by a woman who knows the mystics along with num knights a highranking man within the church all but rule the land and he is not glad the protagonist is back first time i read this book i was around num years old my memories of it was that i liked it but not as much as the belgariad i remember loving the
4344,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,okay so i loved this book i am totally into the story and glad that i bought the entire trilogy at once i hate finishing a book and not having the next ready and waiting there was not a whole lot of resolution at the end in fact it seems to me that this probably should have just been one really long book i am pretty far into the second and again i doubt there will be any resolution to most of what is going on but unlike the song of ice and fire series george r r martin i was not so
4345,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,it s so hard for me to rate this book i ve loved david eddings books since i was a kid who found them stashed away in a friends basement i ve read this series a few times especially as a teen so it s full of nostalgia for me however if i was reading it now it would rate much lower i love the characters and the story so much and they just get better as the series goes on sephrenia and aphreal are wonderful characters the whole group is really but the writing is not great ed
4346,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,although i loved the belgariad trilogy as a kid and was really excited to read something by eddings again and although characters in the diamond throne are lovable and it will be rather unpleasant to leave them to their own devices i decided not to continue reading the elenium trilogy the structure of the story is too frustrating for me there s a problem and the protagonists must take a step to solve it they take it and discover a follow up problem and they must take a step to solve that 
4349,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,the diamond throne is an excellent story covering the knight sparhawk champion to the queen of elenia and his quest to heal his queen who has fallen to a terrible sickness on the way he must face incredible magic unpredictable revelations corrupt churchmen and a knight of his order banished for the use of restricted magic david eddings provides another beautiful story the only problem i have with this is that the whole thing seems a little predestined as though what is happening is t
4350,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,the diamond throne is an excellent story covering the knight sparhawk champion to the queen of elenia and his quest to heal his queen who has fallen to a terrible sickness on the way he must face incredible magic unpredictable revelations corrupt churchmen and a knight of his order banished for the use of restricted magic david eddings provides another beautiful story the only problem i have with this is that the whole thing seems a little predestined as though what is happening is t
4351,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,the eddings s trademark wit and humor is easy to find in this series it s a little darker than one might remember from series like the belgariad or the mallorean the elenium gets far deeper into really byzantine politics and cloak and dagger plots i started out on the belgariad as a teenager and i think i was a little reluctant to try out any of david and leigh s other works outside of the belgariad mythos when i stumbled onto the elenium in a used bookstore though i was far from disappoi
4352,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,if you get beyond the familiarity of the writing or the strange sense you have met the characters before this book can be indeed like a comforting blanket for those reasons you know what you are going to get a band of heroes a quest in num books and finality and conclusion where gods and mortals work together i suspect that having a god that actually answers you in the here and now is something everyone would like a physicality to faith that and being able to do magic this first book sets up
4353,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,i have a soft spot for the series with using the trilogy omnibus on coach trips this is a more adult rather than youth based series when compared to the belgariad/mallorean quintologies resultantly it is a better book and series for it while predictable it is an ideal fantasy comfort read with better rounded characters flushed out better compared to earlier books the story and editing are good and it travels at a good pace with just the occasional moment of excessive tweeness if you enjoy
4354,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,2,a passable start to a swords and sorcery trilogy too much wandering around without much plot movement the queen in this story is immobilized in a protective diamond casing so our hero has to travel to place a to find out what happened to the queen before she was encased he finds out the guy who knows is in point b and so goes to point b a guy at point b tells him the queen is poisoned but the antidote is at point c but after getting to c our hero discovers the antidote might not even exi
4355,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,2,i love the pawn of prophecy and the belgariad series so much i had to give mr eddings another chance with a different series so sad that it was a little too similar to the belgariad with the same characters and personalities but with different names and roles the new mythology of this world is interesting and different so i got through the story but i couldn t stop my brain from constantly comparing to rand belgarath and the rest of the crew this is still well written and edited so i ll
4356,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,an fun and entertaining novel although not very remarkable it s kind of your run of the mill fantasy adventure fare with knights kingdoms magic sorceresses and age old relics of untold power the book even starts out with a prologue that is scarily reminiscent of the forging of the one ring from lotr while the diamond throne is fairly mainstream there is a light heartedness about it that is hard to dislike the characterisation is probably the book s strongest aspect the novel s hero 
4357,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,while the elenium series has all the faults of eddings previous series the one dimensional female characters who always fall in love with much older men the travelogue style of storytelling etc it also had two very interesting features for me fist the protagonist was not a youth who has no idea of how important he is and through whose eyes we learn the world our hero is a grizzled veteran although of course he ends up with a teenage bride which gives a fresh look at world building se
4358,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,remember the old adage never judge a book by it s cover well i did and am glad for it this was my first foray into fantasy fiction soon after i began my num year tenure at weebee waldenbooks the cover art caught my eye and i ended up reading the entire story arch i ready a lot of fantasy fiction since but this was the one that opened that door still have the hardcover in my archives i still do a lot of my book shopping by this method judging by the cover art to make first a first impres
4359,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,it s an epic quest to find a cure for elania s queen who has suddenly fallen ill the book introduces many characters and lands and works to develop both with varying degrees of success by the end of this book the evil plot is revealed and a plan to restore order and save the queen is determined though no real headway is made yet this is a quick read and a book that can easily be put down and picked back up again however that does mean that some may choose to leave it rather than finish
4360,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,classic fantasy at a fantastic pace i read this originally as a pre teen and it was one of my first introductions to the genre i was hooked i eagerly awaited the day when the next one would hit the shelves at my library and requested the next through the inter library loan system devoured each in the series and hungered for more the book and the series are trope ridden and formulaic but the characters are engaging dialogue is witty and the characters endearing i ve gone back and reexamine
4361,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,this is a book that i re read every few years i am actually up to my second set of this series the first one was passed around to so many friends it just fell apart it may not be the best written fantasy and many people here on goodreads have many comments that are not in favour with this book but i love it sparhawk is still one of my favourite characters of all time whenever i am feeling depressed about anything or need to read an old favourite after suffering through to many books i h
4362,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,i have not read any of novels by david eddings so i looked forward to this however i was frankly somewhat disappointed it was just okay never reaching any higher level the plot was rather basic adventure story with random stuff happening the characters seemed a bit too cardboardy there s the hero the sidekick the mysterious kid and so on and i never got the urge to keep on reading after finishing one or two chapters also the mission the main characters undertake seems to be very ur
4363,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,2,i have reread this series and intend to do so every decade for the rest of my life along with raymond e feist s riftwar and empire david eddings belgariad mallorean elenium and tamuli patricia briggs hurog raven mercy thompson and alpha and omega joel rosenberg s keepers of the hidden ways unknown classic dave duncan s a man of his word unknown classic robin hobb s farseer and tawny man s m stirling s dies the fire margaret weis and tracy hickman s dragonlance chronicles tad william s memory s
4364,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,when this series first came out i was annoyed at its similarities to the belgariad and the mallorean after recently rereading all three and the tamuli as well however i ve come to decide that this is the best of them all sparkawk makes for a much more enjoyable protagonist than garion the setting is much more interesting and feels more fleshed out i also preferred that for most of the series the power level of the magic involved was somewhat less ridiculous the series still has its faul
4365,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,i have liked david eddings for a long time his stories will probably not change your life however as sword and sorcery goes the diamond throne is a solid first part to the elenium trilogy the hero sir sparhawk returns from an enforced exile to discover the new queen has been poisoned and the kingdom is rife with political intrigue and so begins his quest to save the queen and restore balance to the continent an easy read with humour and sword fights a plenty well worth a read now the on
4366,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,i recently brought home a box of books that i had picked up when i was in high school and college that i never got around to reading including the elenium series by david eddings i had read several other books by the author when i was younger and was looking for a fun quick read so i opened up this book and was not disappointed i enjoy eddings style the the characters are complex enough to be interesting and the story lines offer enough twists to keep the books engaging without being too con
4367,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,i missed david eddings i read the belgariad a long time ago and loved it this was kicking around at my cousins house and i decided what the heck it s fun the main characters are wonderful the plot is intriguing lots of witty exchanges close calls and swordplay of course my only scruple coming back to the series now that i m weighed down by a bit of literature education is the unnecessary use of adverbs annias i hate you sparhawk shouted angrily would be a good example if
4368,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,i read this trilogy in high school and all i remembered was loving it since i was somehow convinced that it was related to the belgariad and the mallorean i decided to read it again it is in no way connected which was slightly disappointing but it was every bit as good as i remembered while the plot is less intricate in this series than in the belgariad i think that eddings does an even better job with the characters something i hadn t thought possible i laughed my way through this stor
4370,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,well this book is pretty bad the story is simplistic there isn t any sensible driving logic behind the individual steps elaborate plans never fail etc the characters don t have any sort of character they just say or do stuff that needs to be said or done at a given point i don t think the author did any background research on things like swordsmanship or medieval warfare regarding the descriptions and playing out of individual scenes on a scale from teletubbies num to song of ice and fi
4371,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,i haven’t read this book in years so i thought i’d give it a try to see how well it’s held up the answer is not entirely well the plot moves fast the dialogue is witty and the characters likeable sparhawk s a great example of a paladin in literature but the characters personalities all fade in service to the quipping dialogue even the taciturn knight cracks jokes perhaps the characters are too likeable and perhaps most telling of all everything just seems to come too easily the chara
4372,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,meet saprhawk a pandion knight he is the archetype of chivalry and swordsmanship fortunately he is also intelligent he needs to be his protegee the princess elissa has been cast in crystal to prevent her dying from the effects of a poison administered by a schemeing churchman the only solution is to take possession of the bhelliom a jewel so old that nobody knows precisely whence irt came and use it to heal her i love the characters in the trilogy they are an extension of the person
4373,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,bit disappointed i came to love eddings through the belgariad unfortunately this serious which i ve recently reread reads like a search and replace of the belgariad the same jokes and the same characteristics are trotted out sometimes a single individual in the elenium series has traits of two or three characters from the belgariad but othertimes one name has just been substituted for another is it laziness on the part of the author or merely lack of creativity i m ignoring the option
4374,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,darker and grittier than the belgariad and the malloreon the first installment of the elenium is fast paced and filled with action and tough but lovable characters that you ll find yourself attached to within pages sparhawk is probably one of the most well loved heroes in fantasy fiction his no nonsense attitude and dry humour works extremely well with his easy going friend kalten and the other additions to their party their bond is probably one of the biggest highlights of the elenium as
4375,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,david leigh eddings is equal parts gateway drug and macaroni and cheese it s basic fantasy but so enjoyable interesting if not astoundingly innovative just fun and it s just comfort food i ve re read the belgariad/mallorean and the elenium/tamuli so many times since i originally devoured them in middle school while i prefer the belgariad both series can just hit the spot the elenium/tamuli involves more political and religious intrigue while also being more knightly than the be
4376,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,this was a pretty easy read the prologue at the start had me rolling my eyes with the typical long winded retelling of an ancient legend like so many fantasy books seem to it did start to get better with the introduction of the main characters but i honestly never clicked with them none of them had much going for them all the goody goody type that seemed to get out of any problem without a scratch and none of them developed one bit i ll forgive the book this since it is the first in a se
4377,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,beware this review is influenced by sentimentality david eddings is comfort food it s funny interesting and reasonably paced i grew up on these books they were read to me as a child and they were friends during those awkward teen years not to say these are bad books just that they re not so terrific you won t be able to live without reading them warning if you read too many eddings books you will begin to see patterns in his archetypes and quests i suggest if you do intend to read them
4378,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,a great beginning to a fantasy trilogy sparhawk an pandion knight returns to elenia for the first time since his exile to find that his queen ehlana has fallen under a mysterious illness and her body has been encased in crystal to preserve her life joining with friends and allies and outwitting not a few enemies sparhawk begins a hunt for the cure to her illness before time runs out david eddings is definitely a great author of fantasy writing an enjoyable novel with humor and solid cha
4379,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,david eddings is an absolute master of dialogue most authors have a hard time making their characters talk to one another without all the awkwardness and stilted conversation he is hilarious he does not take himself or his characters predicaments seriously and i have had a wonderful time reading this the only reason this is not marked with all five stars is because the conflict is not resolved in any way even all the way to the last page i am lucky to have the whole elenium series in one
4380,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,2,long since donated i read this more than num years ago both the belgariad and the malloreon series became absolutely a part of me i read them in order straight through over the course of two weeks and when i came to the end i was devastated that it meant i had to bid the characters farewell when i started the elenium series i just wasn t grabbed by it in the same way i think i enjoyed the others so much that nothing else would do so i wasn t able to enjoy this and barely got a chapter int
4381,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,good not as good as the belgariad but it seems whichever series you read first you inevitably prefere i feel that these characters just are quite as developed as eddings characters in the belgariad and the mallorian for starters when you first meet his group of knights they classify one as a talker and the other as the strong silent type ironically the silent one out talks the talker four to one in all the following chapters that and other things make me feel like eddings just didn t 
4382,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,i really enjoy reading this book and the rest of the series and it s follow on series sure they aren t high brow literature but they are a great fun read i laugh my way along at the witty repertoire of sparhawk and his friends it s been a few years since i ve read the series but after catching a reference to it in one of the kate daniel s books i decided it was time for a re read of course having my computer break while on fieldwork in myanmar where i have limited funds and little access t
4383,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,sparhawk as an older battered knight works well as the lead character but the rest of the cast seem to be a little two dimentional especially the knights from the other orders the story as a whole is quite entertaining and in this first part of the trilogy manages to miss eddings infuriating habit of slamming a bit of deus ex machina in whenever he writes himself into a corner as in his deamers series this book also manages to lose the smugness that althalus has though the protagonist s overw
4384,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,not as good this time around my tastes are changing it was not as clean as i thought it was in my memory of reading it over num years ago would i hand it to my teens well i did before re reading it and now i wish i hadn t eddings is a very good story teller but why does he need to reference to naked women so much no real descriptions are included but i just wonder why some of the details even needed to be included it had no real bearing on the story line and it just made the characters s
4385,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,i love sparhawk every time he’d open his big mouth i’d smile he was a wonderfully developed character and i loved the way how he’d interact with the other cast needless to say i had a lot of laughs over him the story itself was long though like very long and i skimmed perhaps a few chapters you know for the highlights and random snappy laugh out loud sparhawk dialog num but i must say that the story knows how to get exciting when it needs too the plot was intense the whole th
4386,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,i first read this series while on christmas break during my first year of college my family had moved across the country and i spent several hours in the various bookstores in their town this series caught my eye and i purchased all three of the books as i reread this book twenty five geez i got old years later i realize how juvenile the writing is and how formulaic the plot and characters are but these books are like instant mashed potatoes to me i know there s better things to devour 
4387,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,i am a huge fan of david eddings and the worlds that he creates i feel that his books are very easy to read and his characters very endearing i find myself caught up in the plight of the main character as they struggle to find a remedy to the problem that confronts them some criticism could be made that the main character of sparhawk is not human enough and lacks normal character flaws this however does not detract from the enjoyment i received from reading this book or any of eddings works 
4388,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,2,moody opening get quest travel banter travel fight scene travel banter travel plot point/twist/revelation travel banter travel fight scene repeat i loved these books when i first read them in my teens rereading them in my nums the bones of the formula that produced them became so pronounced that i couldn t help but see them jutting up through the meat of the novel sparhawk and strider are cool the mood of the opening is compelling some neat stuff happens here and there it s jus
4390,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,i really think this is the book where the eddings do their best work it s similar of course to the other novels but sparhawk himself is a different sort of character at least as the protagonist one would more likely find him in a supporting role that makes this and the entire elenium up to perhaps the last few chapters work very well indeed i have a deep affection for garion but if you like to start with the best read the diamond throne first 
4391,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,i just re read this book after saving it on my bookshelf for num years or so it was intense when i first read it and i really got into the story and the fantasy world couldn t wait for the numnd book in the series re reading it was great fun and i enjoyed it didn t have the same edge it had the first time though i did enjoy the characters though sparhawk the knight is a very tough customer worth a second read and now onto the ruby knight 
4392,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,2,uh i started this one before my seizure and frankly i can t remember what is going on plus there is a lot of crudeness in it i will see if i feel like finishing it after eldest only one painful book at a time i remember now why i never finished this series i just don t like the main character and that just kills a book for me if you want to read david eddings go with the belgariad garion is a much better main character 
4393,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,mmm re reading an old favorite i ve never been a huge fan of the first two books in the elenium there s not enough ensemble but it s a nice set up for this world and so much gets put into motion in this book and it kinda is a nice spin on some fantasy tropes like that the protagonist is fairly experienced there s a lot he doesn t know of course but he s not as young and naive as the traditional epic fantasy hero 
4394,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,if your looking for high brow intellectual stuff don t look here this is a very good boys own yarn i love dickens etc yet it was the likes of mr eddings who sparked that passion for reading when i was a teenager i lost him along the way but thought i would read what happened after i stopped reading you can see similarities to the characters in the belgariad but so what it s a good story and you can lose yourself in it for a while i m glad i have found a bit of my boyhood again 
4395,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,1,neighbor i am confused i loved other books by eddings the belgariad and the malloreon series in particular but this was dreadful i don t understand all the num and num stars for this book the book is almost entirely exposition characters repeat things over and over again for no reason one will come up with the most obvious idea and the rest will think he is a genius it drove me up the wall i already bought the second book so will probably read it but i am not looking forward to it 
4396,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,this was the first hardcore fantasy novel that i d read in years and years that didn t start with harry potter and the it took a while for me to get into it but once i did the story really flew by and i need to get my hands on the other two of the trilogy so that i can get an epic fantasy under my belt again for a re introduction into the fantasy world or an introduction for a newbie this book series would be a great place to begin 
4397,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,1,this is a kind of book you can pick if it is raining and you have nothing else to read and your tv is broken there are absolutely no emotions in it just rather limited dialogs and one fully predictable plot reading his book reminded me of a cruse you enjoy it at the very beginning but soon being contained on a ship with very limited choices gets boring if not frustrating this was my first book of eddings and i was hoping for more much more had to force myself to finish it 
4398,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,david eddings is one of my all time fav authors his characters are so well written the stories so entertaining they keep you glued to the pages of his books i can remember still be up at num numam reading his books and laughing myself silly at parts if you like gripping books with humour characters that don t always take themselves too seriously though when the going gets tough they kick ass and happy endings you have to read all of books in the two series david eddings wrote 
4399,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,the content was as ever terrific however do not read this in the kindle version some idiot has ruined the layout by an incredibly huge amount of typos there are several hundred full stops missing which actually alters the meaning of some sentences i had read the book in paperback some years ago which is how i know although some of the errors were so blatant it was hard to miss them 
4400,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,i was glad to get all of the books in this series as a christmas present because i at the moment i finished one book i had to start the next one and i recommend to all of you who still havent read these buy them all before starting to read or you will regret it the moment you finish one book and realize you dont have the next one yet these books can make anyone fall in love with fantasy 
4401,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,rereading this after college was a trip women are all irrational but deserve their pedestals men are all either burly warriors or effeminate pederasts sex workers all love their jobs i didn t really pick up on those things when i read it at at num that said eddings joy in his stories and characters is manifest he was quite conscious of his own limits i am here to teach a generation or two how to read and he still made me laugh until i cried 
4402,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,this is pure popcorn fantasy it s plot driven bursting with action lighthearted humorous at times filled with lots of characters that have little substance to any of them and carries a sarcastic edge to it that almost seems to mock the fantasy genre it requires nothing from the reader but that you sit back and enjoy the show if you accept it for what it is at face value it s actually quite enjoyable 
4403,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,this is a well written fantasy book it is engaging and humorous the only reason i didn t rate it higher was because there were a few annoying points where the characters were all just a bit too slow witted i know it was a tactic used to give information but i personally found that it made for some inconsistencies in character personalities and it was just plain annoying despite this i m looking forward to reading the next book in the series 
4404,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,this is my first reread of this book since i originally read it some twenty odd years ago i remember having some fond memories of the series but i find it hard to believe that now the so called knights of the church were very happy to wade into a battle and kill/murder they were also not very pious some parts were good but this is very much a product of its time and making use of a fan base from the belgariad books 
4405,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,i read the elenium in my late teens and in the following decade re read it at least another eight or nine times even though i ve never been big on fantasy this story was just the right amount of funny exciting and epic it doesn t take itself too seriously but still has a few interesting sociological and theological tidbits inserted into the plot add in a white haired renegade knight with a deep resonant voice and i was sold the elenium was a very amusing light read 
4406,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,2,not nearly as exciting or interesting as the belgariad which wasn t terribly consistent in its own right this is one of those high fantasy books burdened with the same tired cliches of evil coming from the east and only a handful of farsighted warriors bothering to take action add some tiresome political subplots and a romance with very disturbing implications and you have an underwhelming first entry in david eddings most overrated series 
4407,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,first in the elenium series this series is a prequel to his earlier tamuli series and fills in a lot of information that was referred to in the later books however many of the plotlines have already been given away in the earlier published but later occurring books it s starting off as a good series and i d recommend you read this series first before moving on to the tamuli there s more suspense that way 
4408,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,2,after completing the malloreon david eddings decided to create a new fantasy setting with a new cast of characters and write a new fantasy series with the exact same plot we ve already seen twice before the writing is still bland the plot is still hackneyed and now the characters are no longer particularly charming although they all neatly correspond to characters from the belgariad and malloreon avoid 
4409,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,it has been a few years since i read this book ive now read it three times and i still think its great any book that makes you believe you are there in the fantasy world in your mind is a great book the story flows very well and the story is very good it makes you want to buy the next of the trilogy to see what will happen next read it and you won t be disappointed especially if you like fantasy stories 
4410,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,ah my favourite eddings series begins here sparhawk you legend of stoic manhood how you inspired me in my teen years for that i offer you my never ending spect btw edge of sanity have two concept albums which always make me think of this series for some reason crimson and crimson num and the us book art is awful my mother got me the last book in the series while traveling and it was this garish comic book looking cover whereas the aussie covers were beautiful painted things 
4411,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,i first read this book back in the nums sometime and loved it the main thing i love about david eddings is his sense of humor there s this wonderfully dry wit throughout all of his books this was the first book of his that i read i have since read just about everything he s written his books aren t always short but they are always very readable 
4412,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,i forgot this book doesn t really finish now i have to find the time to read the next one but it was refreshing to read it again after so many years i still love sparhawk the character but i had forgotten all about a few of the others if you enjoy heroic fantasy you will enjoy this book read the series they are all enjoyable 
4414,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,could be one of my all time favourites i will only know for sure when all my time has passed lol the story is really nice i always love medieval like worlds and stories about knights but i really fell in love sort of with the words the characters talk in a bit archaic and formal way they re sarcastic and make silly jokes all the time i love the sense of humor in this book 
4415,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,great great great read the use of the english language in this book and the series is very good so well written and the story is brilliant the ruby knight was my favourite out of the three but the first was just as good with humour mixed with peril and the struggle to overcome pure evil this is a great tale that you won t be able to put down 
4416,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,i haven t read this series in a while and hot summer weather made it seem the perfect time the elenium is nowhere nearly as good as eddings other work but is as someone pointed out comfort reading the wit and clever repartee is present as always the first book did seem to drag more in this series than in his other that caused me to knock off one point on the rating scale 
4417,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,no matter where i have gone including deploying overseas and what i have done in my life david eddings books have gone with me and have seen me through all sorts of times the characters are alive and well in my mind and in my heart and i revisit them regularly in the well thumbed pages of my sets i think i am on my numth copies now lol
4418,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,there are a lot of similarities between eddings the belgariad and this this feels more adult somehow but i didn t enjoy the characters as much as i did with the belgariad the familiarity of eddings work was nice and i blitzed through this book because of his style and the story itself sparhawk is a good character and i look forward to his continuing adventures off to book two 
4419,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,sparhawk is great character i would love to see this is an movie my opinion vin diesel would rock the part the book is filled with plots twists friends enemies and frenemies the queen has been poisoned and the hero must search out a cure by the end of book one we have found hope of a cure but still not the cure love it 
4420,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,it makes much more sense then i remember it making when i was a girl i understand the politics about it a lot more i do think eddings is more than a little heavy handed with his descriptions of the races and if you look to closely you realize that the narrative relies far to much on some seriously unlikely chances but i still enjoyed it and will probably finish the trilogy 
4421,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,i ve lost track of how many times i ve reread this book i love sparhawk with a passion that is disturbing and find the older protagonist so much more fun to read than edding s earlier series as much as i like the characters in the elenium the plotting never stop making me laugh maybe it was the gods lol 
4422,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,i read this book num years ago and loved it listening to it again was uneventful it is a good story but i can t find what it was that made me crazy for the books so long ago different chapter and likes in my life then vs now that being said i do recommend this for a good epic adventure lord of the rings esque read well worth the time spent 
4423,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,i got sidetracked from my goal of catching up on all my library books by a gift from a friend hardcover versions of the elenium and the tamuli series es by david eddings so i indulged myself this weekend with a reread of diamond throne it s still fun still classic eddings read gender issues oh my and i still adore all the knightly banter 
4424,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,5,a queen in distress a kingdom under threat a whole load of political intrigue and then enter a knight in shining armour in this book eddings has created a medieval setting in a fantasy world it is completely gripping and i couldn t put it down even though i have read it before perfect holiday / honeymoon reading
4425,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,2,the book was okay and i mean okay i have few kind words for eddings this time given in previous success with the belgariad he got to comfortable that he refused to take risks with another style or storyline elenium is carbon copy of belgariad all he did was change characters names and bang the elenium i recommend the book as a second option 
4426,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,read this as a teenager and loved returning to david eddings world politics gods swords and magic oh my i enjoyed it a lots less as an adult the pace was a bit ambling as was their journey however it s a great high fantasy world and i am looking forward to visiting again in the rest of the elenium 
4427,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,2,the beginning of a new series set in a different world but still feeling familiar and not in a good way the characters and plot just feels like a remix of the last series and the lame jibes continue to annoy the good thing is that the writing is more mature and the characters are a little better developed in this series 
4428,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,4,this was one of my favourite series as a teenagers it is funny intriguing and full of adventure there are not one but two rogue characters who are both charming and wonderful i am not sure how it holds up to an adult reading but i as a young adult book it works the story held up by the cast which is delightful 
4429,The Diamond Throne,David Eddings,3,the diamond throne is well written but is let down by a meandering plodding plot that doesn t go anywhere i felt like i was being taken from city to city meeting similar people and being told the same story over and over pro s sparhawk is a great character wonderful intricate world building nice fight scenes cons very slow few good female characters not a tonne of excitement

4432,A Game of Thrones,George R.R. Martin,1,there are plenty of fantasy authors who claim to be doing something different with the genre ironically they often write the most predictable books of all as evidenced by goodkind and paolini though i m not sure why they protest so much predictability is hardly a death sentence in genre fantasy the archetypal story of a hero a villain a profound love and a world to be saved never seems to get old it s a great story when it s told well at the best it s exciting exotic and builds to a

4443,A Game of Thrones,George R.R.

4483,A Game of Thrones,George R.R. Martin,5,i am enjoyed reading this book but i feel awkward to imagine and read the nudity and sex scenes it is natural to have this such feelings i understand why these characters have done something because it makes them tempt to do it back there in the old days they only care about sex to have heirs wealth food wines and battles women doesn t have enough power women may do something for men to earn the money or something to fulfil whatever men desire them to do something they want these women

4511,A Game of Thrones,George R.R. Martin,4,let’s start with the lord of the rings why first because it’s the only other fantasy novel i’ve ever read two because it gives us a readymade point of comparison and three because a song of ice and fire even in its uncompleted form surpasses the lord of the rings on every level save the cloying power of nostalgia when i think of the lord of the rings i think of high school i think of chess club members and d d get togethers on prom night and virgins getting stuffed into lockers

4519,A Game of Thrones,George R.R. Martin,4,in a game of thrones martin s dwarf tyrion lannister explains that most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it true i think isn t that why we read fantasy novels about gallant knights that die fighting bravely against the undead sure they die but they die bravely when other soldiers die serving their lord they die loyally regardless the dark lord will eventually implode and flowers will bloom unlike in reality of all the characters in fantasy few seem to have stepped so

4534,A Game of Thrones,George R.R.

4535,A Game of Thrones,George R.R.

4536,A Game of Thrones,George R.R.

4538,A Game of Thrones,George R.R. Martin,5,wrensreads review my goodness i sadly have watched the shows before reading the books…but i am kind of happy that i went against this unwritten code of mine there are a lot of names to remember like really a lot the show helped in a way of giving me faces with names so i can remember the relations between families and people and who did what so there is a benefit in watching the show before reading the books martin is a brilliant writer he writes in the mind of children boy and girl a
4539,A Game of Thrones,George R.R. Martin,5,i loved this book there was action right from the beginning i d already watched the tv series which was brilliant but reading the book made me appreciate the job the directors did on the show the casting was spot on in my opinion the book does have an edge over the tv show as it goes more into what the characters are thinking because of that i had more sympathy for tyrion than i did in the show my favourite character was arya i just loved how tough and smart she was i m really lookin
4540,A Game of Thrones,George R.R. Martin,5,well that was quite the experience i m not entirely sure how i was ever able to put this book down before i suppose i ve adapted to reading enormous high fantasy series so reading this was a lot more pleasant this time around i m not entirely sure what to say in terms of a review it s an absolutely fantastic first novel in a series it s wildly entertaining and everything is laid out beautifully everything was built up so gradually that by the time we got to a full fledged war how and why

4542,A Game of Thrones,George R.R. Martin,5,it s a complicated book but that s because it s a complicated story it will take a while to read but it s totally worth it along with the rest of the series well written with such diverse characters that jump from the page constantly keeps you guessing so compelling so captivating a true fantasy fiction to get completely lost in the only thing that i did not like was two characters that i really liked died 
4543,A Game of Thrones,George R.R.

4544,A Game of Thrones,George R.R. Martin,5,i am so proud of myself for reading this it was actually really really good i felt some parts did drag on but that might be because i took an entire month to read it overall it went by fast and if i didn t have to read other books at the same time i probably could have read this in a fairly short amount of time there is so much drama and a lot of twists there isn t a lot of action until towards the end but i still think it keeps a nice pace to it it s told from multiple character perspe
4546,A Game of Thrones,George R.R.

4660,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,the dark is rising by susan cooper is a young adult fantasy novel first published in num the second book in the series of the same name apparently the first book over sea under stone was written for a younger audience and provides more of a prequel than a beginning point this book tells the tale of will stanton who on his eleventh birthday learns that he is an old one a member of a group with magical powers who represent the light opposed to the members of the dark cooper uses colorfu
4661,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,the one of my heart but not entirely a book of childhood unlike the rest of the series this one is layered all through young adulthood for me i read it countless times as a wee thing of course but it was also my book on a horrible flight home from oxford after trinity term and what i read the week i retired my first guide dog and what i read in tiny pieces in the month after i lost my eye looking at that list is one of those foreheadslap moments where you notice that narrative refrain i
4662,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,i suspect that the books of this sequence are among the most beautiful i ve read i get that feeling especially with this book the tone here has changed already from the blyton esque kids on a great adventure of the first book and the character is different accordingly it s almost a bildungsroman for all that we only see less than a month of an eleven year old boy s life one of the main things i love about this sequence particularly from this book on is the characterisation where simon j

4670,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,i loved this book very much in my early teens unfortunately it was a disappointing re read the imagery is still very beautiful but i now find the worldbuilding unsatisfying it suffers from the unquestioning existence of good and evil labels the good are good because they are born that way merriman the protagonist s teacher places great emphasis on the burden of being for the light which i now find disturbing not noble their burden is that they have to be misunderstood by the ordinary p
4671,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,i saw the movie the seeker which i now use as a standard to judge all movies i really dislike but i was required by my class to read it so i did honestly the book was entertaining but i still didn t like it for multiple reasons the beginning was really hard to follow susan cooper needs to make it less work for the reader to try and figure out what s going on the plot was good the classic battle between the darkness and the light but will stanton didn t have to make any sacrifices seri
4672,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,num/num/num more of my christmas reading this time i m struck as i never was as a teen how very bleak cooper s universe of light and dark is the old ones for all they come from human families presumably if will stanton is representative are not even a little bit human and light and dark clash in ways that care nothing for individual men and women their battle isn t for the sake of human salvation it s for things and forces far far beyond human concerns this becomes most evident in silv
4673,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,read this for the second time ever for the darkisreading challenge i had forgotten a great deal of it like the fact that it takes place between the winter solstice and twelfth night i remembered that it was will s numth birthday but not the significance of the date/s it has been really interesting to read it now with a community and see how many people were influenced by this book and series i can also see how it has influenced modern middle grade fantasies 
4674,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,num num stars long past childhood i read this book for this first time high marks for the fabulous writing see excerpt below and for the vivid setting i felt i was there during the christmas season in hunterscombe england the plot is fairly gripping especially the scene in the church on christmas day after everyone left and the scene in will s home when a very unwelcome guest was invited to come in and the scenes of the bone biting deep freeze that struck other good scenes come to
4675,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,not impressed comparing these to lewis and tolkien is a big stretch this is the second book in the series and i must say i was seriously disappointed the comparison to lewis or tolkien probably caused me to drop my rating i even considered a one decide for yourself about this but there is for me a feeling of what could have been in these books the writing itself isn t the problem it s just and this is my opinion the story feels awfully flawed i wanted this to be a better book i really

4677,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,i’m trying to think of how many other books’ sequels are more notable than the books themselves the dark is rising is the second book in the sequence yet it was the one that got adapted into an apparently awful film and it was the one that gave its title to the entire series i suppose i can see why of the first two books it more stereotypically conforms to the monomyth and has that “epic” quality one desires in “epic fantasy” over sea under stone is firmly a juvenile adventure whereas t
4678,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,this is the second book in the dark is rising series unlike over sea under stone this book is much more supernatural/magical in fact the jump from the first book to the second almost feels like a jump to a different series except for the continuity of themes and some characters like the first book this one is very well written and passes the audiobook test which in my experience tends to expose sloppy writing this book like the first was brilliantly read by alex jennings as for the
4679,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,this book has maybe one of my favourite ways of looking at england the country and people he saw one race after another come attacking his island country bringing each time the malevolence of the dark with them wave after wave of ships rushing inexorably at the shores each wave of men in turn grew peaceful as it grew to know and love the land so that the light flourished again it doesn t quite work i think there s the issue of colonialism which was arguably wave after wave of the dark
4680,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,i first read this when it was released around num years ago i was already in my late teens but i ve never seen age as a barrier to reading good books no matter what age range they were intended for the entire sequence is terrific but this is the book i always come back to often at christmas when the book is set will stanton s num year old jump from straightforward boyhood into a world of mysticism and magic is brilliantly described and the story moves at a perfect pace what can i say 
4681,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,the dark is rising has been one of my favourite books ever since i first read it aged about seven given its midwinter setting it s a book i often re read at christmas though i hadn t done so for a few years the last time i tried was in num when it snowed heavily the weekend before christmas and the snow didn t melt until almost new year and somehow having actual snow outside and bitter cold instead of the normal damp mild greyness of december made it seem far too bleak and real and i had
4682,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,there is pretty much nothing i did not love about this reread whether it was the hazy fondness of nostalgia or the sheer delight from the story in and of itself oh will stanton i adore him at thirty almost as much as i did at ten i love how visceral both his fear and wonder are i love his family sorry drews the stantons kick your ass i love the push and pull between will as old one and will as youngest stanton the contrast between wise magical dude and little boy never fails to delig
4683,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,it is a long time since i last read this series and this numnd part of the series is very well done indeed if reading book num was a throwback to an earlier time and structure and as noted not a bad thing this book is leap years beyond well written evocative and visual descriptions that add significantly to the tone and atmosphere well structured great pacing with tension derived from a variety of situations not the least will s family well built with enough background and story t
4684,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,these things are so enjoyable i m considering hoovering up one a day before i start back at work next week really loved the clarity of the images cooper paints the carved doors in the snow the burning log across the old lane the palm fronds packaging the carnival mask from jamaica my only complaint is the persistent potter bashing i see in other reviews it s as if people are angry that this series hasn t gotten the same crazed treatment and/or think that they are somehow better than potter
4685,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,i read this many years ago and liked it when the movie came out not a very good movie i wondered what my num year old self would think of my hazy memory of what my num year old self had thought turns out my num year old self wasn t much of a critic the dark is rising was quite disappointing making it all the more surprising that it won awards and stuff i guess i can kind of see why the writing is at least meant to seem deep the fact that it has a literary style of any kind is a novelty 
4686,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,okay wow i should definitely have read this when i was younger and i m very sorry that i let my feelings for the ridiculous movie adaptation muddle my appetite for reading the actual book 
4687,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,a re read of book num of the series the eponymous volume which gives the series as a whole its title in contrast to the first we are plunged into out and out fantasy from pretty much the start of the book the setting is a few days before christmas and it is nearly will stanton s eleventh birthday will would like nothing better than a white christmas but it is a case of be careful you might get what you wish for because a whiteout occurs which paralyses most of england and is actually a
4688,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,relatively dark this second story is shorter than the first book in the series and a completely different story as in the first i loved the narrator s voices for the characters i know that these books are aimed at middle grade readers but the children s abilities to solve problems come a little too easily i m still willing to see what the third story brings 
4689,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,i wouldn t say i totally enjoyed the first in this series over sea under stone but at least the kids were active in searching for the treasure here in the second book we have a main character that doesn t really do anything he s around when things happen but that isn t nearly the same thing when you start a story off by having a character learn he must find certain objects you figure the searching will be an exciting complicated part of the plot in this book he is either lead to each p
4690,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,i ve never so disliked a book i very much wanted to like this second installment of the dark is rising sequence completely failed to engage me i thought the first book over sea under stone was not bad at all interesting concept decent plot but this second book had the most banal characters an undeveloped plot and essentially no character development for the protagonist will my primary issue with this book is that cooper took a great concept arthurian myth and failed to turn it into
4691,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,the first num pages or so did a good job of sucking me in cooper knows her english folklore well and there s an unsettled dream like quality to her writing that i find appealing but once the plot kicks into gear the book devolves into a manichean light vs dark fantasy with a subtle but ever present reactionary streak the light is almost always associated with englishness whereas the dark is coded as foreign brought into england from the big scary outside the betrayal at the center of
4692,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,the dark is rising was entertaining but i was a bit disappointed in it my main issue is that everything just happens to the main character will stanton he doesn t get a chance to actively make any choices or take any actions independently everyone just throws all the solutions to him including giving him a book to read that infuses his mind with all the answers to his questions it would have been more satisfying for him to work a little bit to be the hero 
4693,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,this is a lovely seasonal read don t know how i missed it growing up i blame parents i particularly like the fact that i finished reading on a key date

4695,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,the second is the series and one that i enjoyed as much as the first although it could be argued that the writing is so much richer that i found myself questioning whether someone totally different had written it will the seventh son of a seventh son has found that he has a role to play in the great war between the darkness of the light and set around a time of renewal and light cooper is clear that she is celebrating the times before christianity and giving a more than subtle nod again to
4696,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,vague wordy and devoid of detail a typical hero’s journey with not much to compel the reader forward and not many important characters actually have names so who’s ready for a vague plot summary ☺ yay warning severe sarcasm ahead you’re a seemingly normal boy who hits puberty and suddenly you discover that you’ve been special all along yay you never knew this but turns out you’re the only person in the entire universe who can save us all by going on this big quest or else the world
4697,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,reread for the umpteenth time i first read this when i was around num or num and have reread it many many times in the num years since often as the sort of slow paced christmastime reread that i pursued now starting on midwinter eve and ending on twelfth night there s a special sort of magic to reading slowly savouring the seasonal magic of this book on the days that things happen in it i always love rereading the dark is rising it captures a certain sort of magic better than anything else
4698,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,it took me a while to get round to reading this which i don t mind too much reading these books is like coming home in a way i ll touch on that more when i review the grey king and silver on the tree i think anyway again this is a bit of an on the spot overview of how i felt reading this book just this time my longer review which really covers how i ve felt about the book over the course of many rereads is here the second book of the series is probably the most familiar to me i didn

4700,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,upon rereading as an adult i m finding this book and series difficult to categorize although on one level i enjoy the lyrical writing the english mythology and the fascinating world building i find the incongruities distracting no wonder i didn t care much for this series as a young teen the book itself doesn t quite know what it has to say the battle of light and dark of good against evil is central to good fiction and especially to epic fantasy the major problem i found with this

4702,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,a book which i can never be unbiased about it s just always spoken to me ever since i heard the radio play at the impressionable age of eight or nine or so funny to think i did pass it over in the library once aged about thirteen it was in an edition on its own and i didn t want to read it like that because i d figured out there was an earlier book and i hate reading things out of order this is where the series starts to mature a little it s still pretty much dark vs light rather th

4704,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,this one is just magical much of the writing comes close to poetry in this title i will insist that the writing is of higher quality than j k rowling as much as i love harry potter this is the best of the series will comes into his powers and discovers he is the last of the old ones he has to find the five signs and save them from the dark the series is based on english folktales of arthur and merlin i think the reason why this never came close to harry potter in popularity is that will
4705,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,the second book in the sequence shifts gear to epic and prose to mythic will stanton discovers he s the last of the old ones on his numth birthday he must gain command of his powers and quest for the signs of the light before the dark puts them beyond reach mentored by merriman lyons and supported by the circle of old ones around the world can he grow up fast enough to keep the dark from rising this is a very different beast to first installment over sea under stone but brilliant in its own
4706,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,there was a lot more going on in this book than in over sea under stone and with this book the series is beginning to feel mythical and epic an enjoyable and quick read but there wasn t anything here that surprised me an eleven year old boy is journeying around and finding little mythic trinkets in legend of zelda fashion and it s all happening in a few days right around christmas i would ve loved this as a kid but now it all feels old hat but i enjoyed it enough that i will continue
4707,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,one of my childhood favorites though the plot and characters still resonate with me after all these years it has a moral complexity that adult novels all to often lack no matter how many times i read it it still keeps me up past my bedtime with its mood of quiet menace 
4708,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,i ve read this one a number of times over the years but today s re read was really inspiring this is the true stand out of cooper s fiction a work equally effective for adults and for children i think that in the ways she weaves english folk tales poetry and the fantastic the dark is rising is one of the finest works of genre fiction moreover the book is filled with deeper truths about sacrifice good evil and the way our deepest commitments can threaten our humanity eat cooper s sho
4709,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,a very enjoyable fantasy novel although written for children it is more than good enough to be enjoyed by adults it s not exactly character driven and the main protagonist never really does anything but rather has things done to him but the plot has plenty of interesting twists and turns and i was never bored while reading 
4710,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,this is a book i read for the first time as a child it had a profound impression then so much so that the first snow we have the kids and i curl up to read it aloud the setting and characters are vibrant the magic and intensity in the tale cause a familiar shiver as an adult definitely a family favorite

4715,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,novel review for the dark is rising what would you do if you were suddenly forced to face a powerful force the day before your eleventh birthday the plot of the story contains twists and loops of adventure and bits of mystery the characters are portrayed in third person point of view and are described throughout context the story takes place in multiple areas of time and space the dark is rising by susan cooper is an interesting novel that follows a boy named will stanton and his journey to
4716,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,there are many books i enjoy there are few i cherish i cherish this book i cherish the entire series except for the first over sea under stone which just doesn t seem to fit but this one has a special place in my heart the dark is rising would be classified today as young adult fiction when i first read it at the tender age of eleven it was considered children s fiction and it was the first children s fiction book i read that treated the audience like adults it was a book of
4717,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,susan cooper s num novel is pretty much the last word in the second golden age of british fantasy it s one of those books that just can t be denied rather like a force of nature and it s not hard to pinpoint why there s a legacy to cooper s work that runs pretty deep not just in the ancient british mythology she invokes like so many of her peers but in the actual structure of her story the inexorable one of her favorite words approach of the dark is rising owes a lot to the wolves

4719,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,why is it that some books are deemed timeless and others are not is it because they re simply outstanding or a little weird and ahead of their time you just know in a century there will still be new fans to pride prejudice or the lord of the rings every day i wish i could say the dark is rising falls within the same category but i cannot the dark is rising is not a bad book by any means it s exciting at times and has most of the ingredients for a great fantasy story the old ones an
4720,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,gorgeous haunting enchanting i don t know how to praise this book as it deserves without sliding into the realm of gushing sentimentality but it really is a delight the plot is not flawless but it is intriguing and probably was not as cliche in the nums when it was published as it now seems given the overwhelming quantities not quality of fantastical bildungsroman type ya fiction churned out these days the shimmering prose though sets this work apart from the likes of harry potter an

4723,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,so i am working my way through the dark is rising sequence at present and now is the turn of the dark is rising itself i am struck struck struck by the ferocious nature of cooper s prose throughout these books a prose which is both eloquent and vicious and raging against the dying of the light and the darkness of the worlds the dark is rising is will stanton s story and in a way it is his story that he was destined to always have and to always be at the heart of there are echoes in this

4727,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,there are some books that shape us and for me this is one of them i still have my original copy the broken binding and stained pages a testament to how often i read it the way susan cooper draws her battle lines – dark and light good and evil – is very stark but almost everything else about this book is subtle and real and the writing is superb scenes and pictures from this book have gone so deep that it almost feels as if i lived them myself the rooks the signs the beauty and terror

4732,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,a book about good not really knowing what it is doing vs a quintessential and almost predictable evil with british myth and folklore thrown in herne the hunter the wild hunt yule christmas twelfth night and the hunting of the wren this tale is as british as it can get and since i refused to watch the film then i have no adaptation to compare it to not that i should this is goodreads not sure what else i have to say really but since i love british myth folklore and the ritual year
4733,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,in which everyone i know disowns me guys i just didn t like this like at all between will being a total yutz will s character development will don t do that ok i will refrain from doing that one thing until the second the moment has passed and then i will do the thing you just told me not to do oh i shouldn t have done that oh oh i m an old one now oh and the dark s reason for being the bad guy is well dark is the opposite of light so there must be a bad guy and because d
4734,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,audio book for car/work meeeeeh i loved this series as a kid but this time around i think i stopped listening at the first mention of a black rider the book has a whole white/good dark/bad theme but i still think susan cooper could have come up with a different term when lotr is probably the most influential fantasy book of the current age you need to not have characters that are so derivative i kind of forgive george rr martin for copying the name of frodo s father for khal drogo kind
4735,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,this is another of those stories where a young kid turns a certain age and discovers he s the chosen one with multitudes of heretofore undiscovered superpowers and a mission to complete to save the world it s well written cooper s command of the language is complete but the whole quest felt like a big macguffin chase there s no why other than so the dark doesn t win there s no attempt to explain where all this comes from or why these things were hidden in the first place just a tre
4736,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,how could i have forgotten how wonderful this one is i don t know why i never re read it but it s been on my shelf forever and i always looked at it warmly and in fact often said aloud oh i love that book but passed it by maybe i remembered how very scary it is and oh it is the writing is brilliant absolutely top notch there s not an extra word and the words that are there are wrestled into new glittering shapes both malevolent and benignant the characters are similarly familiar
4737,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,1,i think one or more of these have won newberry medals and are somewhat iconic in their genre i ve always intended to read them to see if they were worth it i was enjoying the book until she brought the christian god into it and lumped him up with every other god looking kindly but condescendingly on a christian priest for his poor ignorant narrow minded doctrines that could not see that there is a greater good vs evil light vs dark that existed long before and far outside the sphere of
4738,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,as part of a reading challenge i picked up the dark is rising for the middle school novel category i read it already about num years ago and the only thing i remembered about it was absolutely loving it so i began it didn t take long for me to realize that even though the tale was entertaining i was far more interested in puzzling out just why i loved this book so much i have a few theories but haven t quite it worked it out entirely it was definitely a fascinating journey into my
4739,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,the world is made from light and dark only the old ones keepers of the light have the power to prevent dark from taking over the world they will do this by joining the signs of power to make a circle will finds out he is an old one and not a minor one either he is the sign seeker his decisions are the future and his thoughts are demands by simply telling a fire to start it will by looking at a burning flame he can extinguish it throughout this book he gathers the six signs and join
4740,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,go to twitter check the hashtag thedarkisreading there’s lots there this is a rich text terrifying and ambiguous drawing on myth and legend in a particular landscape looking back to the box of delights as much as pullman’s la belle sauvage looks to it all haunting and beautiful texts key to an understanding of british fantasy literature maybe the dark is rising is hailed as great because it is that pivot 
4741,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,i first read this book in primary school and loved it so much that i did an assignment on it each time i re read i m absorbed into the world of the old ones with their ancient british traditions and folklore christmas is the best time for a re read i ll be leaving this series well placed for my kids to discover when they re ready 
4742,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,the dark is rising the dark is rising num by susan cooper is a great fantasy book for middle grade kids i didn t read the first book but i didn t have any trouble picking up from the first page it had slight suspense mystery magic adventure and intrigue it also captured the middle grade attitude/life style perfectly great job 
4743,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,this was probably my numth time to read the dark is rising during the christmas season a classic of children s fantasy it incorporates themes of arthurian legend and british mythology but remains solidly grounded in the life of an eleven year old boy i have read this book annually at christmas time for many years 
4744,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,i love this book the plot is your basic good versus evil nothing super special but the descriptions it s so evocative good anytime but perfect for mid winter 
4745,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,i was particularly enamoured of the gorgeous illustrations 
4746,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,if this was the first book in the series i would not have read the second confused and episodic nothing like under stone over sea which had a sort of enid blyton joy about it 
4747,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,rhyming prophesy i can still recite
4748,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,i am taking a children s literature class so i will be reviewing a few of the books i have read this is a classic good versus evil book with the num year old protagonist will stanton going back in forth between present time and past time to fight the dark that is coming the story is set in england during the christmas season culminating in the twelfth night of christmas as will is discovering his role in this battle he realizes others have been waiting for him to do his part as the last of
4749,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,this was a favourite from when i was a kid my num year old self would have given it num stars while my no longer num year old self gives it num num i very clearly remember being disappointed when i first read this book that i would never be able to read it again for the first time the drama and excitement would never be new to me again during a re read so i had to be sure to savour it during the first read and there s plenty of drama and excitement young will stanton the youngest of nine children
4750,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,even though this is technically num in the series i m always going to think of it as the first book i like the story of simon jane and barney but in my brain it s a companion to and expansion on the main story of will and later bran i love these books so much this one in particular always feels quaint and out of time to me because it seems vaguely modern not obviously history locked like narnia but at the same time is old enough to lack all the technological trappings of life that i 
4751,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,an incredibly tense ominous and compelling read ‘the dark is rising’ follows the rebirth of an eleven year old boy called will who on his eleventh birthday is awoken to the fight between the light and the dark and the responsibilities that he must fulfill he finds himself in a liminal time that balances on the edge of being overwhelmed by evil forces who are often closer to will than he realizes to me the fact that those responsible for protecting against the dark have such normal roles
4752,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,confusing random bizarre these are some of the words that come to mind after reading this book it s a shame because the story is beautifully written it just doesn t make any sense the story follows will and english boy from the numth century as he comes into his magical powers there really isn t much of a plot here just a bunch of disjointed events that flit between will s village and family life and his out of time experiences some of which are decipherable but many of which jus
4753,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,the last time i read the dark is rising was more than ten years ago in summer and while i always love this book there s an extra magic in reading it during the time of year in which it s set in the dark and cold days of midwinter with the festive pleasures of christmas all around me in real life as well as in the book this time around i probably read it a bit slower too because for the first two thirds of the book i was pacing my reading for the twitter readalong thedarkisreading tho
4754,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,the second book in the series really takes off with an almost all new cast of characters will stanton discovers in his numth birthday he isn t like other kids with the aid of merriman lyon will undergoes magical adventures while searching for six objects that will help him defeat the powers of the dark sorta harry potterish but really that s where the similarities end the writing in this book was beautiful especially some of the poems/prophecies i love all the arthurian and pagan stories
4755,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,nothing less than five stars for a book i read as much with my bones as with my eyes and brain i remember the feel of first and second and subsequent readings of this as intensely as ever and am still as delighted by the confidence of phrase and ease with which grand and old concepts and visions are described with perfect clarity and the way that really rather mixed up timelines come together with absolute grace and common sense i can t wait to pick up the third of these books for it has be
4756,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4, readathonnum το δεύτερο βιβλίο μιας σειράς τεσσάρων ή περισσότερων βιβλίων this was beautiful and perfect reading for the holiday season i picked it up for the twitter read along under the hashtag thedarkisreading i was not familiar with this book or with susan cooper and i loved every minute of it strong archetypes and dualistic forces good evil light dark but set in a marvelous world with incredible imagery and use of folklore i felt like i was transported to the english countryside w
4757,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,i had never read this so the thedarkisreading hashtag on twitter encouraged me to to do so having heard such good things from others about it i thought the language used was lyrically beautiful and the descriptive passages were just a delight i was a little disappointed at will s passive character however with events seeming to just happen to him with little input or effort from him i realise this is because he is involved in a pre foretold battle and has no say in his fate really but i wo
4758,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,i can t believe it took me over two months to read this book i am a little ashamed seeing how it is a children s book after all and i am a full grown adult but i will say this in my defense and to susan cooper s credit this book was very thick not in the same sense that one of the j k rowling/george r r martin/j r r tolkien or another of the impressive busy and important middle initial parade lot tomes is thick instead dark is rising is just beautiful and meaty for such a short novel 
4759,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,like many books of the era this is just too slow for me to read as an adult surprisingly it s aged fairly well since it mentions no technology to date it i m not sure how i missed this as a child but i suspect i went from robin of sherwood on tv to the mists of avalon/belgariad without picking up any children s fantasy in between there s very little character development and no real reason for anything to be happening beyond light good dark bad later fantasy seems to place more emph
4760,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,this is a long way from being the first time of reading i have a lovely edition of all four books bought for me as a child thanks mum and they have been regularly re read with joy this one i often read as a standalone rather than as part of the sequence though it works both ways anyway i was inspired to read it over christmas by thedarkisreading over on twitter no regrets one friend has commented that on re reading it didn t live up to their childhood memories but for me it still does
4761,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,i just want to say that i really like the way the main character was treated he was allowed to be a kid he was allowed to make mistakes that didn t ruin everything they had consequences but it was acknowledged that he had made them because he didn t know and not out of malice and when he acted like a kid when he wanted to be only with his family when he was about to cry it was not seen as him being weak at all 
4762,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,a compelling frightening and magical world interwoven with our own and made from our folk and fairytales it s winter snow crisp on the ground when you wake up into a different world than when you went to sleep i love the rhyme at the beginning of the book which you can follow through the story and the real places that are visited in the story i read this as a kid years ago and on rereading it just a few years ago it had all the same magic as before 
4763,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,susan cooper’s second book in this series builds on the strengths she showed in over sea under stone crisp literate writing and a love of mythic britain but she really doubles down on the mythic britain angle and adds a technique that i love and have used in my own work the sudden transformation of the mundane into the surreal even cozy family scenes can turn on a dime into unsettling horror while still staying suitable for young readers she threads a very thin needle there quite skillfu
4764,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,well that was very little like the first one in the sequence but it was good it s much more mystic and fantastic with old ones the the dark herne and lots of other bits of myth from british history will on his numth birthday finds out he s one of the old ones and has much to accomplish to protect his world from the dark it s spooky a bit scary and worth the reading children s lit that doesn t doesn t talk down to children 
4765,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,our num num year old group read the classic the dark is rising by susan cooper most of us were disappointed as we had really expected to love it some commented that there was too much description and others that the time jumping was confusion this may be our lowest scoring book hoping for much better next month we rated it num / num / num / num num / num / num / num / num / num
4766,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,this book is a bit denser and more confusing which perhaps was inevitable as cooper introduces the actual meat er magic of the series it definitely took more effort to get through than over sea under stone but it was good in its own way i m glad merriman was in this one as a tie in or it would have felt too disconnected from the first book 
4767,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,pulled me out of a slump loved the writing so atmospheric and just beautiful highly recommend if you re looking for something easy going and a little bit dark great characters great plot will hopefully continue with the rest of the series 
4768,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,the twitter group read a long gave me the kick in the pants to pick this up and i m very glad i did i started reading on mid winter s eve which is when the book begins but i couldn t quite keep the pace until the twelfth night it s eerie and snowy and the battle of light and dark carries on will stanton wakes up to a quest that is his as he turns eleven i m really enjoying the read a long as it is fun spending time with this book with other people too 
4769,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,this book is one of the touchstones of my year every christmas after the gifts are opened after dinner is eaten after my family have all gone home or to bed i light the candles in their angel candle holders and i read this book by golden candlelight and every year it s perfect 
4770,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,an excellent re reading over christmas 
4772,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,last book i read in num i first read this in the num’s as a kid and loved the whole series re read for first time since then as part of twitter read a long i tried to read the book with the time line of christmas in the book but finished it ahead of twelfth night i think it’s much darker reading it as an adult than when i read it aged num/num or maybe i understand more considering rereading the rest of the series and then might do same for the greenknowle books 
4773,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,third re reading of one of my favourites read as part of the dark is reading readalong lovely to read at this time of year 
4774,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,as a youth i really enjoyed this book and its prequel over sea under stone for some reason i didn t pick up the other books in the series though upon re reading it doesn t hold up as well for me i had zero recollection of anything that happened in this book aside from a faint remembrance of the christmas party scene at the manor house so it felt like i was reading this book for the first time i found will stanton to be a bit irritating it was hard for me to reconcile that he could
4775,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,i really like the storyline and concept of this book but the long descriptions and writing style made it a bit of a slog at times 
4776,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,i m reviewing some of my favorite wintertide comfort books for the holidays the dark is rising by susan cooper was one of my childhood pleasures in reading fantasy it was dark horrific enthralling and otherworldly also very english which is what christmas time should be in my heart of hearts what s most interesting about the the dark is rising is that as i ve re read it as an adult the glory of what cooper accomplished here grows it is fundamentally a fantasy novel about a boy who d
4777,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,my second or third time reading this one i absolutely love the images created by the author of this english village the dark and especially the rooks 
4778,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,a holiday tradition one of my all time favourites 
4779,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,a good christmas reread i hadn t read this series since i was a kid but picked up this edition recently at the library book sale 
4780,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,a gripping plot tho’ not the easiest to grasp 
4781,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,update num/num/num once again i m disagreeing with myself and my original review below as well as num year old pierce s assessment this happened with over sea under stone as well but in the opposite direction num year old curmudgeony pierce wants to give this num num stars rounded up to four but num year old pierce thought this was his favorite in the series and would surely have given it all five stars had goodreads existed back then but al gore hadn t brought the internet to the masses yet i m af
4782,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,it is winter it is christmas 
4783,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,a decent children s fantasy book made better by excellent narration of the audio book 
4784,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,the day before his birthday will stanton notices that animals suddenly seem to fear him by the next day when he turns eleven it has become clear to will that the animals know what he is only about to realize that he is not an ordinary child but an old one with the important destiny of finding and bringing together the six signs that will vanquish the dark as the days pass from his birthday through christmas and on to twelfth night will experiences the usual christmas festivities of hi
4785,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,i do love a good foreboding would be even better if it wasn t constantly accompanied by assurances that nothing bad can happen to will which undercuts it a bit 
4786,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,i think i first read this series in fifth grade unlike most books from my early life i ve reread them several times and own the series it s a really great blending of some general celtic myth with bits of arthurian as well it s a really amazing series in this book will stanton has a birthday and his whole life changes the youngest of several children suddenly finds out he has a legacy to live up to he is one of the old ones guardians of mortal men from the powers of the dark his world
4787,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,well the book struck out boldly in attempting to do a lot of things but i don t think it quite ever did them too much was amorphous and vague too often seemed like a poor version of other great books whose feeling she was trying to imitate also too many characters introduced in one book couldn t handle the fact that all but one character was new and the family had like num kids on a larger note i just don t know if this book fits in with the whole christian mythology type scheme that so m
4788,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,i first read the entire sequence of the dark is rising in the hot sunny conditions of a summer holiday in southern italy appropriate maybe for the first in the series over sea under stone but not so much for the second the dark is rising takes place in susan cooper s native buckinghamshire up into the chilterns and down along the thames during the darkest of dark times midwinter s eve through to twelfth night i reread this now as part of robert mcfarlane s global thedarkisreading readal
4789,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,i reread this on audiobook in january num my initial review from num was glowing i called it one of the richest books i’ve ever read when it comes to history mythology and cosmological good vs evil concepts and i was madder than a wet hen that some of the other books in the series didn t live up to it after nine years of reading i would mitigate the glowing terms slightly but i would give a lot more credit to the other books in the series i think my enjoyment of the dark is rising wa
4790,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,i loved this book and gave it a rare num star rating 
4791,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,will stanton is the youngest of a family of nine children on his eleventh birthday he is told that he isn t an ordinary human but the last of the old ones born on earth to prevent the forces of evil from seizing power with the help of his mentor merriman lyon he must learn to control his special powers to fight evil for good the dark is rising is the second volume in susan cooper s series of the same title since we only meet the most important character in this second book you can read it b
4792,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,here it is a well written children s book that incorporates arthurian and celtic mythology without resorting to cliches or dumbing down the ideas for children excellent plotting pacing and setup for future stories while it was very different in tone from the first book in this series which was more of a mystery it dealt with the same themes of the fight between light and darkness in the world i really liked the fantastic elements throughout this book and since it looks like the subsequ
4793,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,this book is everything that people say it is and lives up to its reputation beautifully a fast fast paced read it manages to never feel rushed as it takes you through the twelve days that mark young william s ascension to what amounts to minor god hood and because this is a british novel from the early num s will is neither obnoxious nor overly precious and so his transition feels believable including the parts of him that wish to stay normal the cast of characters is larger but compelli
4794,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,as a child i never got past the first book in this series which i seriously regret a wonderful and rich history is woven into this story with well developed characters beautiful settings and just enough adventure to keep the pages turning 
4795,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,this book made it clear that the good/evil theme in much fantasy is just about making someone else evil without explanation and then spending the rest of the book to show why the writer was correct it s pretty lame thinking and lazy writing the good are good because they are us and so we identify with them the evil are them and so we don t it s not a real exploration of the theme and how it works this is troubling because when people don t face some outside wwii ish villain or the easy
4796,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,i don t know what it was but i did not like this book at all the writing was strange everything happens very fast and there s very little explanation given for a lot of the things that go on will the protagonist seems to obtain knowledge from seemingly nowhere everything moves at a very brisk pace almost alarmingly so and while i wouldn t say i was lost it was definitely difficult finding even ground the time travel aspect of it all felt out of place and will seemed to do so with ve
4797,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,pretty decent boy wizard story but i preferred the previous book over sea under stone which had less magic but more adventure this suffers from the usual chosen one problem too much predestination which undermines the tension of the story also its a bit video gamey the plot involves collecting magical items and at one point something happens which i can only describe as leveling up it took all my self restraint not to shout level num achievement unlocked uncompelling the other problem i h
4799,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,i liked this book but i had a few issues with it her use of adverbs after dialogue tags was driving me crazy but eliminating those is a more recent convention i think this book is num years old also i really liked having an num year old protagonist but he didn t do enough in fact sometimes he screwed things up and had to be rescued and the whole light/dark imagery became trite at times the coolest thing about it was the whole mystery of it we didn t really know what was going on we
4800,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,although this is the second book in the series it essentially revamps the character and story and could be considered a good starting point my eleven year old son who is fully versed in all of the pretenders to harry potter s throne found the first book under sea under stone completely uninteresting and didn t read more than a few pages but i dropped the dark is rising on his nightstand and anxiously await his verdict where the first book constantly hints at magic and mythology but nev
4801,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,forget the movie which was total garbage and buy this book for any child especially young boys who love adventure and magic and mystery this is hands down one of my favorite series from childhood cooper has the very very rare knack of writing for young people without either writing down to them or treating them like adults who have been shrunk in the wash based in roughly modern day england this book is wholesome and good without being saccharine and is a coming of age story in the
4802,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,i read this because it was on newsweeks what to read now and why list it was a list of num books and i had read only num shocking i know actually alot of them i really don t want to read no matter what they said about it this one sounded intriguing though even though it was a young adult book it is a newberry award winner and deservedly so it was num on the list and here is what newsweek said forget harry potter in the tradition of tolkein this series of novels about five british chi
4803,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,this is the second book in the dark is rising series of books what s a bit odd about it is that the only character in this book that was in the first book over sea under stone is that of merriman lyon and he was secondary i did not enjoy this book as much as i did the first one i fell in love with simon jane and barnabas drew and they had nothing to do with this story this book is a series of quests that will stanton a brand new character to the series has to complete successfully in o
4804,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,when you are eleven or twelve years old a little bit lonely and feeling different from everyone else and you find a book about another eleven year old who discovers he s magic is different from everyone else has to keep it a secret that s powerful stuff i could pick this apart as a cynical grownup but i m going to remember back to my num or num year old self reading about will stanton for the first time not exactly sure what was going on unfamiliar with some of the legends and mytholog
4805,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,highly recommended children s/yas fantasy adventure set in buckinghamshire and steeped in the mythology of the british isles it is somewhat dated now but since it deals with universal themes the importance of family of accepting responsibility for ones actions how ones actions can have unforeseen and tragic consequences loyalty love self sacrifice it is still a very good and relevant read it is also nice to read aloud if you are a parent the dark is rising is the second novel in a s
4806,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,there is just something about great juvenile fiction that strikes an emotional chord with me that adult fiction often does not i wonder if it recaptures some of the mystery and strong emotions of childhood that we often lose or discount as adults i’m not sure but susan cooper has this magic throughout over sea under stone and more so in this the second book in the dark is rising series i feel eerily gripped by the powerful struggle between the dark and the light cooper provides a real fee
4807,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,the dark is rising is about a young boy named will who must learn how to use his special powers he learns he must find the six signs and defeat the black rider he learns from the old ones how to use his powers and how he will get the signs to defeat the dark will stanton is an eleven year old boy he wants to explore and learn more about his family he is the seventh child in the family and he is the only one to have special powers he learns of his powers on christmas and uses them to defeat
4808,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,i m re reading this book for like the numth time it such a wonderful story as i was reading i was reflecting on the very magickal trip alora and i took to england a few years back i bought her a copy of this book and while we were staying in a small youth hostel in cornwall we were getting ready to sleep one evening chatting up the other guest a young schooteacher on holiday i talked the schooltearcher into reading the first chapter of the story for two selfish reasons one she had
4809,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,i read most of this series in middle school but i remember very little of it i ve been surprised by all the correlations between the dark is rising and other popular fantasy series i ve been reading lately will stanton comes into his magical abilities on his numth birthday harry potter and the stanton family of nine children with a set of twins bares a strong resemblance to the weasley family also will is the sign seeker and harry plays seeker on the house quidditch team there is even a
4810,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,i remember as a kid reading the lion the witch and the wardrobe a wrinkle in time series c s lewis and others of this particular genre that when i came across this series i was excited and interested i love celtic themes and stories and looked forward to reading the dark is rising sequence my problem with this book is the vagueness i appreciate authors who allow my imagination to run free a little and to fill in the blanks this was not that i had to actually stop what i was reading a
4811,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,i m really terrible at reading series in sequence that s why i like books that stand alone even if they build on an larger story sequence the dark is rising and the series of the same name is an excellent sample of a book that stands strongly on its own and contributes to an entertaining series will stanton gets a warning just before his numth birthday which happens to fall on midwinter s day that he must help defeat the dark as he is the last of the old ones over the next many days he mu
4812,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,i read this to my youngest children ages num and num with other children i led them in discussing the story and we enjoyed looking at it closely and considering the celtic mythology at the end of it though i realized that it was a disappointing book because the main character will isn t in charge of his fate he s called the sign seeker yet he doesn t really seek any of the signs he doesn t even make any choices even when he has to choose whether to give the signs to the bad guys or save
4813,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,i love the atmosphere of this book the way it draws on british myth and legend the vaguely pagan feel of it how heavily it ties in with the season during which it is set there are some great moments i can see how reading it as a child or young teenager could be a really fun and exciting experience but i have to say reading as an adult i found the story a little weak will comes by his powers a little too easily he just knows what to do at the right moment and does it most of the charac
4814,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,i read this book many many years ago as an adult it is still one of my favourite books of all time the hero will is a wonderful character the youngest of the old ones the book is both scary and reassuring the characters are well drawn and it is a brilliant book for older children i was originally excited when i first heard it was to be made into a film with christopher ecclestone but the film does not do the book justice and many of the essential elements have been lost it s a pity su
4815,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,i guess i felt that there was no struggle involved in this in that way over sea under stone was a better book because the children really had to fight their way to the end goal in the dark is rising i felt that absolutely everything was handed to will there was no self enlightenment no moment of wow i never would have believed i could do this why should i feel anything but envy for a character who was destined to have this adventure from birth and never for one moment had to work har
4816,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,1,first off i hated this freakin book where do i begin well first off there was zero character development i think there was also just to many characters introduced at once i kept forgetting who was who this book could go on and on describing the details of a twig for pages at a time and at other times there would be so little detail that i had trouble imagining/understanding what the heck they where talking about this book could ve been half as long there was allot of stuff that happene
4817,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,i found this book just painful to read the premise was good and she took classes from j r r tolkien when he was still teaching but the generalities and abstracts just bored me to tears i would find myself drifting off trying to imagine what the dark or the light or the stag or the hunter looked like and the narrative flow would be gone definitely not enough concrete description to hold onto i kept falling asleep while reading this book a bad sign indeed for me a fantasy fan def
4818,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,initially i was disappointed that this book didn’t continue with the over sea under stone characters but i loved the increased energy in this book and that it contained more fantasy elements it’s a classically themed good vs evil story with some interesting magic and time travel ideas will’s character was easy to identify with and the story line was captivating i really enjoyed it and i’m looking forward to seeing where the next book greenwitch takes me 
4819,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,three stars for nostalgia s sake because i read this book over and over as a kid but truth be told i m rather embarrassed by how much i subconsciously let this book influence my writing i suppose it works because susan cooper knows how to create an atmosphere and there s something very appealing about the setting the rambling stanton farmhouse the small english village and the snowy winter season itself sometimes magical and sometimes claustrophobic but the quest that drives the narrati
4820,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,i was first introduced to this book by ruth feiker the librarian at my daughter s elementary school loved it from the start and over the years i ve read it several times though i think this might be the first time i listened to it alex jennings narrates the perfect choice for december story starts on the eve of young will s eleventh birthday on the winter solstice and ends on twelvth night plenty of english folklore light versus dark good versus evil magical/mystical versus everyday l
4821,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,at first i was disappointed as i flipped ahead looking for the drew family they had disappeared but merriman was back so surely they would be and will stanton holds his own as a major character there s so much exposition and the stanton family is so large and hard to keep track of that this one is a bit of a tough slog but it s good and the stantons need to have multiplicity after all will is the seventh son of a seventh son also contains a first look at herne the hunter a marvelous
4822,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,overall i d say i prefer stories about heroes who become rather than who are chosen but if it the author is relying on fate how better than to use time travelers and incorporate all the myths of the british isles the compressed time period of the winter holidays works well i like that will has a close and involved family parents included such that the author had to take him outside of time to be in any danger the story is well paced the villains ambiguous and the whole thing is enormous
4823,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,i read this with my num year old daughter and we both enjoyed it i found it to be well written entertaining and appreciated the author s ability t morei read this with my num year old daughter and we both enjoyed it i found it to be well written entertaining and appreciated the author s ability to weave the tension necessary to the tale with humorous and warm descriptions of the young hero s family life i did wish that will protagonist had a more active role in the adventure 
4824,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,the only regret i have about this book is the best kind of regret that i didn t read it sooner cooper writes in a way that captures perfectly the mysticism poetry and longing of arthurian lore additionally she wasn t afraid to craft a sense of dread i do love a good foreboding it s as in a good piece of music it builds and builds and you want it to end right away and yet the tension is so intriguing and when it finally resolves it is thrilling my only quibble is that will seems like a
4825,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,perhaps i read this too late i never read it as a child and as an adult the biggest issue i have with it and it s a huge issue is there s no tension and no conflict everything is destined to occur and there s no deviation from that the main character doesn t make any choices he just does what he is meant to do and more often even others in the book do things instead while the main character watches there s a lot of deus ex machinae popping up all over it was disappointing and somethin
4826,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,pro num has time travel and mixes it in with magic/fantasy num i think there are some interesting ideas in the story num i found it to be relatively compelling con num the character development was not as strong as i would have liked although the novel is relatively short which may be the explanation i realize this is a ya book but “the hunger games” for example did a much better job with characters and of course is much longer overall i give this a num num maybe higher for a younger audien
4827,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,after the gaping disappointment that over sea under stone was this book was great it had magic and adventures and stuff happening and fighting the evil dark etc i really liked that there was clear and present danger from an enemy that was interesting what is most interesting is probably the references to folk lore and symbolism of different elements there also seemed to be more clues to follow than the rather dull treasure hunt in the previous book it is also intriguing that a child or you
4828,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,on will s numth birthday he learns he is the last of the old ones and thus begins an entertaining tale of the dark vs the light time travel and the power of magic even though this is the second in the series i had to reorient myself since this story is about a completely different family than the first book and has much more magic although apparently she brings everything together as the series progresses there is still the arthurian theme running through the story which makes it highly
4829,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,the second book of the quintet it tells of will stanton seventh son of a seventh son who discovers he is the last of the old ones who fight the dark he is also the sign seeker and goes on a quest to find the lost six signs it is set in an english village over the christmas period and is very atmospheric with the cold weather and reminiscent of family christmas times of my past involving more arthurian and old english mythology plus wonderful characters and some very emotive scenes it is r
4830,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,for a children s book it was a great yarn with plenty of action and lots of atmosphere it dealt with themes of fear and loss and the battle between good and evil i didn t find it as engrossing as some ya books mostly because the story began to seem repetitive as he goes back and forth in time and the old ones appear when he needs them and he tries to collect each of the six signs although the story starts on the boy s eleventh birthday he seemed much more mature than the num year olds i ve
4831,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,the whole series is a dark magical journey just at the edge of what children can handle i loved these books as a young adult i think that means kid and reread them recently they don t work as well as an adult madeline l engle falls completely flat for me as an adult c s lewis is still magic and susan cooper is somewhere in between i highly recommend these books to people under num if you read these as an adult they just seem like a children s version of every other fantasy novel of co
4832,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,so the movie the seeker totally mangled this series of five books stripped them of all the folklore and arthurian history and turned the menace of the dark into a joke with a piss poor actor skip it and read the books instead the movie was mostly based on this book which leaves out some very cool adventures and characters in the last three will discovers that he isn t just a middle boy in a large english family but a wizard type who must use his power to gather a series of symbols toge
4834,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,i listened to this and maybe i would have liked it better if i d read it instead for some reason my attention kept drifting as i was listening and i didn t ever get fully invested in the story or the characters it s a series i ve wanted to read for a while but i m going to stop with this second book for now and if i decide to continue at some point i will probably read rather than listen and see if that makes a difference 
4835,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,probably my candidate for the childhood book that left its deepest mark on me more than narnia more than tolkien susan cooper s writing may perhaps be best described as restrained which is why i had so many fears for the movie and was rightly worried turns out but she breathes elegance and wonder and so much meaning into every line of her work that i m constantly amazed by it it s so clean and powerful and she manages to evoke giant explosions despite using such a light hand 
4836,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,not a bad story just doesn t hold up well against some obvious comparisons the learning phase of this story seems abrupt and the central protagonist seems more otherworldly than relatable the absence of character growing into a champion caused this to fall a bit flat for me i hope my opinion improves with the rest of the series 
4837,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,superb series of five books this is num and is by far the best in the series seriously creepy fast moving and loads of fun as young will comes of age on his numth birthday and enters into a magical world cooper s depiction of our world and the mystical one colliding and interweaving is wondrous one of my favorite series to re read 
4838,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,this book is seriously creepy in fact if the main character wasn t an eleven year old boy i would never have believed that this is a young adult book i really liked it the descriptions and scenery were steeped with exquisit details and the uber creepiness of the whole thing kept me very involved until the very end great book 
4839,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,wow it looks like i may have never rated any of the books in this series even though i loved them all and i read them obsessively strange i did read them a few years before i joined goodreads though this one is my favorite in the series num num/num stars my least favorite in the the series the last one is probably either a num or a num num/num 
4840,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,in perfect honesty i didn t finish this book i know some of you love it i know it s won awards i liked it well enough but it was the least gripping read i ve picked up in a long while the other books in my did not finish shelf are there because i found them objectionable this books isn t objectionable at all just meh 
4841,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,i ve always liked scary books when i read and reread this one best at midwinter instead of thinking ooh this book is scary i m filled with a real sense of dread beyond being a fascinating story it makes the reader consider deep questions about the meaning of good and evil and how difficult it can be to recognize which is which 
4842,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,1,i wanted to love this sooooo much but alas i didn t too many portals and magic that didn t make sense i know it shouldn t have to but it should to be fair i wouldn t have liked this as a kid which is maybe who i didn t like it now my nieces might though 
4843,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,a children s series but still enjoyable to read as an adult the epic battle between the light and dark is decided by which side can acquire certain ancient artifacts a grail a harp elemental signs a crystal sword 
4844,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,3,the discussion of this whole series in among others has made me want to reread it so now they re on the list 
4845,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,i ve read this book about num times over the years my most recent read was in response to the seeker movie so my copy went to my friend lisamarie who loved the movie but had never even heard of the books 
4847,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,not as fun as the first book in the series i never felt much for will and i don t have a good feel for the magical world he s introduced to did a lot of skimming in the later pages still i ll probably read the next book in the series 
4848,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,i m always surprised that more people have not heard of this series susan cooper is a masterful writer and these books are some of the great unsung works of fantasy fabulous stuff can t recommend these highly enough 
4849,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,fantasy which re animates my local myths such as herne the hunter but loses a point for omitting uffington where st george slew the dragon and alfred the great defeated the vikings and kate bush went cloudbusting http //www youtube com/watch v irhanumw 
4850,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,i loved this book as much as i did when i first read it as a teenager the characterization and elements of fantasy are excellent i love snow imagery and this book has a great deal of it i m looking forward to re reading the rest of this series 
4851,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,my favourite children s author i must have read this when i was about nine or ten this is the best of the series in my opinion also the one i read first the grey king was my other favourite all set in britain and involving a sort of pagan conflict between light and dark scary too 
4852,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,this is one of my all time favs i read this as an adult but love the way cooper weaves grail lore manicheaism and english pagan knowledge into a story of boy who discovers he has a special destiny on the eve of his numth birthday top notch read 
4853,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,i like all the books in this series but the dark is rising was the best cooper s writing approaches poetry as she describes will s education as an old one her combination of history myth and weather is spectacular 
4854,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,i originally read this in junior high after my favorite librarian of all time mrs larson recommended it and i picked it up again recently to see if it would make a good gift for one of my nieces or nephews i was enveloped in the magic of cooper s story telling i was captivated 
4855,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,4,wow i liked this book even more the second time around the coolest thing was the time travel since the old ones can go back and forth in time i liked will stanton s character i just wish he had helpers of his own age rather than only the adults num solid stars 
4856,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,2,unique concepts but boring read the fact that the character thinks clinically like an adult and suffers heavily from the superman syndrome makes him extremely unsympathetic for me i read the book after the movie which i liked a lot but was disappointed sorry 
4857,The Dark Is Rising,Susan Cooper,5,read aloud with the num year old

4861,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,one of the great fantasy series ever notice i didn t say for children this series is for everyone with unforgettable characters including faithful gurgi what really makes this series is taran s journey from a hot headed stubborn youth to a man fit to be king of prydain the most moving scenes of the series are in taran wanderer when taran learns that to be a hero with a sword in your hand is no more worthy than to be a blacksmith weaver or potter the scenes when taran finds his lo
4862,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,one of my favorite series of fantasy novels this series is for kids to young adults but i reread them a few years back and still enjoyed them it is often what i recommend to those who liked harry potter and want something similar it is full of good morals mainly geared to growing men and values honesty and integrity over flash and heroics its not all wholesome cheerios though they are genuinely great books the series starts with the book of three it is simple and a bit childish frustrat

4866,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,i fell in love with these books when they were first read aloud to me as a child and they remain just as wonderful now that i’m an adult my husband and i read them aloud to each other during our first year of marriage and ended up staying up far too late reading on nights when we had to work the next day the characters are unforgettable and we find ourselves making allusions to what certain characters would do or say in our situation i can’t wait until our son is old enough to enjoy them a
4867,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,this is a very charming loveable fantasy/coming of age series and it definitely deserves more attention than it gets on behalf of all prydain fans i d like to ask where s our live action movie version of this all we have is one very cute but let s face it also dated and somewhat inaccurate disney animation film the story basically follows along the course of five books the coming of age of young taran an assistant pig keeper who dreams of being a hero he makes and in many cases loses

4889,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,probably the third best fantasy series ever behind tolkien and lewis like lewis alexander s stories are small in scale and scope more like folk art than tolkien s high art and feature children as the focal characters while he shares with tolkien a more self consistent world that is rooted in literary contexts of our own world welsh folklore in alexander s case of the three alexander s unique contribution is that his stories follow the children as they grow and become adults tolkien s

4899,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,the series is much better than i remembered from when i last read them some num years ago in many ways it is admittedly reminiscent of the lord of the rings though i wouldn t go so far as to call it derivative more that they both seem to draw on some of the same much older stories i should say the series is also much darker than i remembered for example i had completely no recollection of the scene in which eilonwy narrowly escapes rape and implied sexual bondage at the hands of dorath
4900,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,i actually started reading this because i read jrr tolkien was inspired by this series to write lord of the rings the first chapter of the first book you can definitely draw similarities between a few of the characters but the plot is very fresh and original it has a lot of fantasy a lot of magic and of course eilonwy who i adore if i had to compare her to someone i would say she reminds me a bit of luna lovegood which of course is harry potter and not lord of the rings still that s who
4901,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,this series is a great read they are a quick read if you want to know if you like them book one the book of three can stand alone there will be unanswered questions but the adventure in the book is complete book two the black cauldron is also its own adventure although there are still things in the land of prydain that need to be resolved these book do have a dark element to them and sometimes some graphic battle images but never described in gorey detail i m surprised disney eve
4902,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,stephen king once said that he d pay someone millions of dollars if they could invent a machine that would let him feel as though he s reading his favorite books for the first time again if such a machine ever comes to be the chronicles of pyrdain will be the set of books i spend my imagined millions on better ya than nearly anything out there today little pieces of wisdom scattered throughout all five books heroes who pay a dear price for every piece of wisdom they gain and every victory
4903,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,these books despite the travesty that disney made of them with its halfhearted movie attempt are simply spellbinding i grew up listening to my father read these on car trips over breakfast and before bed we gathered as a family to follow the adventures of taran wanderer and his companions and we would listen to them over and over these are the kind of stories that stay with you the kind that you build your childhood around and can t wait to carry on to the next generation these are the
4904,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,this is a lovely series for young adults i read it to my sister who has a horror of anything scary but even though these stories deal with difficult and frightening themes she was quickly won over by the excellent characters and the moving story her special favourite is gurgi and i think that mine is probably fflewdur flam whose name i discovered in one of the catalogue of names in the mabinogion the stories re imagine celtic mythology and center around a character named taran who is se
4905,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,this is probably the best children s fantasy series i ve read the first book book of three is merely okay i d give it num stars but the second book the black cauldron is fantastic and the series just gets better from there the series works as a children s book not just by virtue of being simple and easy to read its themes are inspiring and its morals are in the right place none of that divine right of kings like tolkien and none of the misogyny of c s lewis it also has a real female
4906,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,i grew up with these my mom read them to me i always feel this series starts somewhat weakly written for a younger audience without the depth that other authors c s lewis lend to their children s books however every time i come back to the books i find that i love them all as the series progresses the books and the characters mature though many of the images are familiar from other works it was in part based on welsh mythology they lose none of their significance for being repetiti
4907,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,3,i m not a fantasy person i have a working knowledge of fantasy tropes and stories and works and i ve seen lotr and i love fairy tales but i don t really enjoy reading fantasy all too much and this series is an example of why there s not enough structure here too much roaming around whining about what will become of us i love the part about the cauldron and the horned king and some of the side characters but the lead here is so boring and dumb that i really don t remember much else about
4908,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,3,when i was a kid for a time lloyd alexander was tied with dickens as my favourite author he’s best known for this series the chronicles of prydain which is a children’s high fantasy epic quest boys’ adventure kind of thing in retrospect that sounds really dull i say meh to boys’ adventures and high fantasy seems ill suited to children’s stories because the world building ends up too slight and sanitary anyway even when i was a kid i preferred a different alexander series the westm
4909,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,i read these for the first time in fifth grade reread them about num years ago and one per night this past week i really like these and though they are kids books it is fun sometimes to take a break from nibley heidegger anf foucault and delve into some good clean fun i think that of all books non religious this set really shaped who i am i really wanted to be like taran in this book when i was young and wanted to gain the same wisdom and strength that he did since i started out as h
4910,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,my library recently acquired lloyd alexander s papers and after attending a lecture about him i have wanted to reread these favorites from my childhood ah these did not disappoint this is classic fantasy similar to lord of the rings at times and as an adult i enjoyed alexander s messages about the type of people we need to be this edition included some short stories set in prydain which provided good background information for the series 
4911,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,i remember reading these books many years ago and quite enjoying them though most of the detail of the story had escaped me on re reading i again enjoyed them a great deal and not i think for reasons of nostalgia they are simply well written and tell an enjoyable tale recalling to mind the similarly excellent earthsea books that are for children but not quite glad i picked up this collection to give them another go 
4912,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,i read each of these books individually but it s easily one of the best fantasy series in existence geared towards children it should have the same amount of recognition as the classic chronicles of narnia by c s lewis in regards to plot elements many similarities can be found between these novels and tolkien s the lord of the ring however there are striking differences and this is an excellent gateway to the fantasy genre for a younger crowd 
4913,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,i read almost this entire series as a kid i didn t want to finish the last book and have the series be over and i loved it i read it as an adult and loved it still the same taran wanderer is my favorite but as a set this is deserving of num stars a must read for kids 
4914,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,my grade num teacher mr baltgailis read a few chapters of these books to us everyday after lunch he made the characters come alive and this series left a great impression on me twenty years after i spent quite a bit of time hunting through used book stores searching for this set which i finally found same edition as what he read to us very nostalgic i haven t yet found the time to sit down and reread the series but looking forward to getting to it again soon 
4915,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,this alongside the chronicles of narnia was my gateway drug into fantasy and medieval studies i was seven it was the greatest thrill of my young life to delve deeply into taran s adventures to this day num years later i remember exactly where i was exactly what i was wearing exactly what i was snacking on and exactly how i felt when i was reading each of these books i wore my first set out 
4916,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,this is a series from my childhood which i find unforgettable and one i regularly re read with my children i find it to be a classic tale of friendship adventure and learning how to be there for your friends when they need you perfect for young ears and hearts even today so thank you sir lloyd alexander for your tales which continue to enchant me today just like when i was a wee chit of a lad and which i share with my lads and lass happy reading everyone 
4917,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,i like the narnia books but these books really take the place in my heart some people reserve for lewis work taran gurgi eilonwy gwydion they re like old friends and they ve stood up to many readings and many years the black cauldron is my personal favorite but each of them is great in its own way in the end the uniting theme is how even assistant pig keepers can with hard work and good friends grow into true men 
4918,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,this series boasts a newberry award and a newberry honor young taran assistant pig keeper of caer dallben finds himself swept into an ever accelerating current of danger and excitement this fast paced yet well written story encourages strong character built through choice and consequence while highlighting the cost of violence conceit and cowardice a hero’s journey adults can also appreciate 
4919,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,this was one of my favorite series as a young reader and lloyd alexander is one of my favorite yal authors i just finished rereading the black cauldron today and loved it the books are full of adventure and curious characters they also explore what it really means to be a hero and the true nature of honor these books have deep moral/philosophical lessons while being entertaining too i didn t want to set the black cauldron down i m going to continue rereading the series 
4920,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,i loved these books when i was a kid they re a sweeping fantasy tale of good v evil rooted in myth and also a funny affectionate coming of age story i was afraid they wouldn t hold up when i returned to them a few years ago but they were still wonderful princess eilonwy is one of the best girl best friends characters ever and she gets the best witty lines the movie the black cauldron was very loosely based on these books very loosely 
4921,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,i originally picked these up because i was curious where the inspiration for disney s the black cauldron came from boy are these books so much better than what they did with the film yet another fantasy series that takes the normal tropes of scrappy young boy turned hero to a much more real and relatable level taran is such a wonderful protagonist full of real flaws and all the sort of feelings everyone has when they are young and want to do great things a must read for any fantasy lover 
4922,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,i first read this series in school and still enjoy reading it again and again it is easy to like the characters and care about what happens to them something not often found in stories written for the pre teen age group the main character taran learns that it is not as important where you start out in life it is how you go forward on your journey that counts fun to read to young children because they really enjoy saying hen wen is an oracular pig 
4923,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,perhaps the greatest fantasy series for the child/ya crowd ever harry potter has nothing on prydain a coherent contained universe interesting characters following a long bildungsroman arc a solidly feminist female character high fantasy mixes with fairytale storytelling in the best quasi british fantasy world this side of tolkein 
4924,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,i read this series for the first time in junior high and then read them again while in college this was the first series i had ever read i believe the first time i read them i read the entire series in less than num days i can t say i learned a whole lot from the books although they were pretty entertaining the typical good versus evil and all 
4925,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,it s been a long time since i read these middle school actually but it was my first real intro to fantasy and i still remember how excited i was as i was enveloped by these stories i ve been hesitant ever since to re read them for fear of losing the magical feelings i still so vividly remember from my childhood 
4926,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,the ending was too tolkien ish and a little sad but it was a fabulous series overall the black cauldron is my favorite out of all of them and taran wanderer was good in terms of character development but as a story not as interesting as the others i really loved the castle of llyr although it was more of a girl’s story i can see why this series is a classic 
4927,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,this series was formative for me as a writer and as a human being taran and his friends got me through my childhood and the mystical welsh setting inspired me decades later to set one of my own novels in wales in short every kid should read the prydain books before they leave middle school it s a classic 
4928,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,these are a great fantasy set i loved these books so much i named my first born son after the main character taran so many people only know about the movie the black cauldron that disney did which is loosely based on the first and second books combined if you have kids these are a must read num have newberry awards one an honor the other the award winner 
4929,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,i just retread this series for the third or fourth time i absolutely love them fans of the chronicles of narnia the hobbit and harry potter must stop what they are doing and grab these books you will be drawn in from the first meeting of taran the assistant pig keeper as he plunges into adventures he is anything but ready for 
4930,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,my dad read this to me as a kid and i loved the stories when the box set was re released my wife and i purchased it and read it during long car trips it s written for young adults but we enjoyed reading it a great coming of age story overcoming challenges interpersonal relationships and good vs evil 
4931,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,these books alongside the hobbit changed the way i saw the world when i was younger it made me want to travel through woods and forests in search of adventure and action these books made me who i am easily read by children but should be read by everyone of all ages one of the few series that are truly ageless more should be written this well read it 
4932,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,excellent ya series much better than narnia has a great children s story with heroic characters doing heroic things but there are a lot of dilemmas that the younger reader might miss i especially liked the black cauldron and taran wanderer 
4933,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,3,i struggle a bit with how to rate these older children s books the style is quite a bit different then now instead of the stories that appeal to all ages so that they sell more books these are actually more geared for kids not as much filler and not very subtle characters or plot that having been said i really liked this whole set but it didn t make me stay up at night reading it 
4934,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,this was one of my first books that actually captured my imagination it was the first time a book that my grandma loved that was a jf book actually got me excited i could not even get myself to read chronicles of narnia but i could read the chronicles of prydain i felt that i could truly identify with the young pig farmer who is the hero of the series 
4935,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,num the book of three num the black cauldron num the castle of llyr num taran wanderer num the high king i read all five books in high school they are lots of fun i love eilonwy and the way she speaks it s great 
4936,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,it s a very charming fantasy series with a great sense of humor likable characters and culminates in a painful coming of age story for main character taran the assistant pig keeper it s also heavily based on welsh mythology folklore and naming conventions i d recommend it to anyone of any age 
4937,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,oh i just love these books the castle of llyr is probably the very first fantasy novel i ever read and what a fun one it was i like to think of these books as tolkein for kids they have all the components of an epic fantasy complete with the campbellian hero s journey and honestly how can you pass up a set whose hero is known as taran assistant pig keeper i just love it 
4938,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,these are an excellent choice for reading aloud the characters each have a very particular voice and the story is fantastical yet believable a hero is nothing more than a searcher who must make some critical decisions making those decisions requires some heart and soul and making mistakes requires some humanity 
4939,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,i read these books for the first time when i was in sixth grade i remember waiting to get the next one from the library after i had finished the previous seemed like forever this series was in part responsible for my love of fantasy novels i personally think that they are wonderful books for people of any age in fact i just bought them to read again num years later 
4940,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,before harry potter and hermione there were taran and eilonwy alexander s series was my harry potter one of those fantasy series that helped make me a lifelong reader now i am revisiting the series with my own kids like much lasting young adult fantasy it is essentially a myth/quest narrative in which the hero and heroine come of age 
4941,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,the numnd and numrd books are most fanciful and engaging numst has its fancy the rest and sometimes the first three were often too practical for my taste i actually do enjoy this series but for a high fantasy i am surprised by how practically minded it is beautiful wisdom nuggets scattered delightfully through 
4942,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,this was my gateway drug into the world of fantasy fiction yes it belongs on the mg shelf but if you weren t fortunate enough to read this in middle school you should definitely read this now fantastic stuff also highly recommended for those precocious young readers who are not quite ready for harry potter yet 
4943,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,a delightful series in truth this is one long fairy tale which is long enough that the main character taran is really quite developed in the end the target age is probably num num but if like me you genuinely enjoy reading books which are innocent and delightful then you may like this series 
4944,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,my mom read this series to me when i was quite young and i loved it i enjoyed the books just as much when i re read them a few years later lloyd alexander will always be one of my favorite authors 
4945,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,oustanding young adult fantasy which holds up over time i re read the series a few years ago without expecting much and discovered a new layer of humor and adult concerns which had unsurprisingly bypassed me as a child highly recommended 
4946,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,i have read these books a couple times over the years taran wanderer is my favorite one but they are all good and well written written for younger readers but still a fun and enjoyable read for older readers as well 
4947,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,these are the first books my husband and i read together we re reading them aloud again and i d forgotten how much i love them the story is good the characters are memorable and there are little nuggets of truth and things to learn love these books 
4948,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,i read this series in fifth grade i loved it more than narnia and lord of the rings years later i realized it is very grounded in celtic lore i haven t reread it because i know as an adult i won t feel the same sense of wonder and i want it to remain in my imagination the way it is 
4949,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,3,these books had a beloved role in my childhood i especially loved the drama of the black cauldron even for one of lloyd s typical heroes i find teran annoying and dislike how in the end eilonway dimmed her shine literally to stay with him 
4950,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,this series of books has the same feel as the lord of the rings series but personally i liked these much better 
4951,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,travel to the magical land of prydain where you ll meet an assistant pig keeper a furry hungry creature a lying bard and a girl who has a magical bauble then you ll meet the bad guys who have a black cauldron that creates armies of the living dead freaky 
4952,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,inspired by the classic book of welsh mythology the mabinogion this series follows the adventures of taran assistant pig keeper in his quest to find his destiny full of adventure humor and wisdom i consider this series one of my num fantasy series every child/teen should know 
4953,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,one of my favorite fantasy series always gives me a sense of the possible characters are an interesting mix humor lightens everything in this world of bravery friendship and tests of character hints of many legends and stories are woven into a tapestry specific to alexander and prydain 
4954,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,this is ya before the genre was coined and so stands out for its sheer subtle hero themes the young boy hungering to be a true hero and his path to self discovery there is no clear ladder that goes to being a leader and this book stays true to that 
4955,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,what a great set of books these books have excellent characters adventure and great development together the comrades have to go through trials that allow them to learn and grow to become confident in who they are and grow ever thankful for the simple things 
4956,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,my favorite series when i was a kid i liked it better than the lord of the rings and far better than the chronicles of narnia i fell in love with the characters and was genuinely sad when i finished the last book and couldn t live in their world any longer sigh
4957,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,it doesn t get much better than the black cauldron books i think i especially like that each book isn t a repeat of the one before each takes it s own place and you can t read just one of them you ve got to do the whole thing 
4958,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,dad read these to me as a kid saw them in the library and thought i would give them a second read and enjoyed it almost as much as the first time through i already can t wait until desmond is old enough for me to read them to him 
4959,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,my favorite fantasy books growing up i re read them as an adult and still loved them it was a ton of fun to recently read the mabinogi the old welsh epic tales and see how much they d influenced the chronicles of prydain 
4960,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,i was already starting to steer toward fantasy as my genre of choice but this entire series cemented that desire it is a great introduction into fantasy for young readers and i highly encourage them being immersed in its wonderful story 
4961,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,fun childish light hearted often becoming more serious over the course of the series many of the descriptions felt overly repetitive and eventually one could predict how alexander would describe most any character or situation especially recommended to younger fantasy readers 
4962,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,i read the series with my boys and we all thoroughly enjoyed them i liked that the characters were well developed and made appearances throughout all of the books recommended for your young readers 
4963,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,one of the most worthwhile edifying series for kids there is 
4964,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,i loved these as a kid no idea what they are about anymore but pretty sure i still have this exact set on my shelves will save for my kids eventually

5047,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,revisited these for the first time since high school they re like a perfectly rich unfrosted chocolate cake traditional and hit the spot if you re a fan of welsh or british history fantasy or the hero s journey i don t see how you wouldn t like them fun fact i have finally realized that the creature gurgi is what a talking dog would actually be 
5048,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,absolutely charming and delightful i wish i had read this when i was a child over the course of the num books taran starts as a child and grows into a man the subject matter starts pretty innocently and gets darker and darker raising the stakes with each book harry potter did the same thing 
5049,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,the chronicles of prydain is a wondeful series full of fantasy and andveture these books are about a young boy named trana who enbarks on a dangerous adventure in order to save the lands of prydain from the evil queen achren and the war lord arawn along the way he meets many allies such as gurgi who help him along his journey to save prydain this book is best for reader craving adventure and suspense in every book it is also for readers interested in fictional senarios and kingdoms i loved
5050,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,these are the books that made me a fan of reading and fantasy 
5052,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,this is probably one of the greatest fantasy series ever written the character development and plots were absolutely fantastic we got to see taran grow up and deal with heartbreak and realise what it truly means to be a hero i cannot recommend this series enough 
5053,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,the chronicles of prydain was one of the epic fantasy series i read growing up alongside narnia and a little later lord of the rings unlike the other two series taran of caer dallben goes looking for adventure his eagerness to prove himself gets him into trouble with others more often than not some lessons taran learns are far harder than others and by the end of each book he becomes harder to associate with the child at the beginning of the book of three unlike the disney film the vil
5054,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,re reading whatever i can get my hands on lately i knew that this was going to be an enjoyable romp into my past i can t remember when i first read this series but i have clear memories of looking for everything by alexander after i finished the series i wish the sexism and extreme dearth of good female characters num wise witches num headstrong princess num bad witchqueen eventually turned good and one oracular pig do not make nearly enough in the way of females when the entire series is over
5055,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,a great far ranging far traveling adventure this series of books by lloyd alexander are such a treasure i recall trips to the library most likely middle school at the beginning when i borrowed the large hardcover versions the story never gets old for me even though i know the stories by heart now i just need to convince my oldest daughter to try out the series i may need an exchanter s help to make that happen i recommend this book to anyone who likes a grand adventure 
5056,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,4,did you ever see the black cauldron old disney animated movie well these are the books that was based on a couple years ago i read these num books for the first time wonderful stories about trusting yourself and your abilities being patient accepting yourself for what you are and being content with that and being a true friend don t watch the movie again it really is bad read the books instead re read the nooks this summer trying to get my num year old into them he hasn t read them ye

5058,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,i devoured these books when i was young quality fantasy reading for like middle school age give or take a grade to be honest thinking back on the series it remindes me a lot of weis/hickman dragonlance chronicles trilogy dragons of autumn twilight winter night spring dawning but for a much younger audience and with a welsh influence 
5059,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,this book series has always been one of my favorites the characters are engaging and complex the plot is strong and hooked me from beginning to end it’s got such a beautifully written epic hero’s tale and honestly i put it up there with the chronicles of narnia and lord of the rings as some of my favorites of all time 
5060,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,i haven t read these in about fourteen years but when i did i thought they were fantastic i don t know if i would feel that way today so i m scared to revisit them but as it stands right now they re still amongst my favourites 
5061,The Chronicles of Prydain Boxed Set,Lloyd Alexander,5,great series a great set of fantasy books intended for younger audiences but readable by all ages watching the main characters grow almost makes you feel a part of the story especially watching taran mature with each book highly recommend 
5062,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4, warning mention of rape and discussion of such follows i gave this book four stars so obviously i did enjoy it there are actually many many enjoyable elements to this book and i promise to get to them in a moment i found myself so completely annoyed with daughter of the forest though i really enjoyed the book we are treated to the terrible acts committed against sorcha and it s rather graphic at moments yet when it comes to consensual loving sex nothing fade to black the moment
5063,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,first let me give a shout out to the rapists and dog killer/abusers in the book with a gif below now let s crack on with a short review 😊 so sorcha was not born the seventh son she was born a daughter with num older brothers finbar liam cormack conor padriac and diarmid these brothers take care of sorcha and i forgot to mention she s a healer well one day their father brings home the evil sorceress that is to be the wicked stepmother yeah she puts an ole curse on the brothers and such 
5064,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,reviewed by rabid reads num num stars everything i could tell you about daughter of the forest by juliet marillier can be summed up in a single paragraph from the story itself if i were telling this tale and it were not my own i would give it a neat satisfying ending in such stories there are no loose ends there are no unraveled edges and crooked threads daughters do not give their hearts to the enemy the wicked do not simply disappear taking with them the satisfaction of vengeance yo
5065,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,i want to call this book a combination of kushiel s dart and assassin s apprentice but in reality daughter of the forest is a category all its own a gorgeous mix of historical fiction and fantasy an insightful hero’s journey with a dash of romance it’s been some time since i’ve had the pleasure of reading a book so deserving of five stars sorcha daughter of the forest tells her own tale in this book about an ancient celtic/british feud and the magical undertones that influence it she is
5066,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,i love ireland and love retellings so this was all sorts of enchanting sorcha is the seventh daughter of a seventh son and has num older brothers a few of them communicate mentally and there are hints of fae and magic woven throughout the druidic irish setting it s a long story but basically young sorcha s brothers are turned into swans and she has to remain silent for years as she spins a thorny plant into shirts so they can be human again it s a truly miserable isolating task and the story
5067,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,“all that he had of her was his memory where he held every moment every single moment that she had been his that was all he had to keep out the loneliness ” daughter of the forest is one of those books the ones that are scored on my heart the ones that caused both my awe and respect for the story and for the author for it takes a tremendous amount of talent and soul to write such a book i recall the tale of the six swans i remember being a little girl watching the animated version and it made m
5068,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,“real life is not quite as it is in stories in the old tales bad things happen and when the tale has unfolded and come to its triumphant conclusion it is as if the bad things had never been life is not as simple as that not quite ” juliet marillier “daughter of the forest” the above quote hands down sums up “daughter of the forest” for me yes this is a fairy tale but it also speaks truth about life about how once you go forward you cannot go back to the beginning…because things are
5069,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,num num stars aside from a couple of minor qualms daughter of the forest is pretty much an example of an almost perfect debut novel this book is a beautiful retelling of the celtic swans myth which has been familiar to me since childhood through the hans christian andersen s version the wild swans sorcha is the seventh child and the only daughter of lord colum of sevenwaters when colum remarries after being widowed for almost num years the evil stepmother and witch puts a dreadful spell on
5070,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,it has taken me forever to get to this review because i was just not sure how i could possibly pack everything i felt during this book into coherent words stuck together that would even possibly do it justice i still don’t think that i will be able to manage it but i’ll try daughter of the forest dof takes an old irish legend/fairy tale and breathes new life into it i was not familiar at all with the original version of this story so i cannot comment on how closely it follows but i will say
5071,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,incredible i know i ve said i ve been speechless when reading books before but this time i genuinely don t have the words to express what a masterpiece this novel is i actually finished this novel early today morning at around num num but it was only at num num ish that i actually got up to go to sleep i couldn t get this story out of my head i simply kept thinking about it if juliet marillier hadn t already made a fan out of me with heart s blood then i d be tripping over myself to fall at
5072,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,i have always loved the fairy tale about the sister with numerous brothers who had a wicked stepmother who enchanted her brothers to turn them into birds the number of brothers and the type of birds can vary i have seen it with ravens and with swans in daughter of the forest ms marillier used the version in which the heroine has six brothers and they are all turned into swans i must say i truly enjoyed and devoured this heartbreaking emotionally wrenching novel based on that fairy tale 
5073,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,the pages of this book flow like a river of sorrow and anguish and pain and loneliness courage and hope and an unyielding love but the stream is strong so once the current of the six swans retelling has caught you you will be there held like under a spell and unable to stop it is not an easy tale but oh a beautiful one the fairy tale is known and so i am not spoiling anything by telling you that daughter of the forest tells us a story of sorcha the youngest child of the lord of seve
5074,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,what a breathtakingly beautiful book it’s hard to describe daughter of the forest it is a fantasy a historical and a romance it reads like a fable or a fairy tale it has all the elements of a fairy tale – the evil stepmother a fairy godmother sort of an enchantment an impossible task to accomplish a prince charming and a happily ever after this has to be my all time favorite book now i was captivated by the story mesmerized by the voice of sorcha our heroine i did not put this b
5075,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,how do you know when a book is a great book when the line between reality and fiction begins to blur so that you could be sitting on a sunny balcony off a busy street and still feel like you are in the cool dark confines of the ancient irish forests when you are struck with sympathetic muteness because talking means the difference between life and death for the heroine and it takes an actual conscious effort to unlock your throat and answer when someone calls out to you when you sudden

5078,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,trigger warning sexual assault it was very difficult for me to give this book a star rating first off i want to say that i enjoyed this story a lot and found it very enchanting i didn t want to put it down and i will be continuing on with the series i really enjoyed the writing and i thought the cast of characters was very intriguing and really pulled you in to the story the novel did lull in a couple of places but that didn t impact my enjoyment of the book i did listen to the audio book
5079,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,3,num num stars wondrously evocative and lyrical enthralling suspenseful redundant too redundant this is a popular romantic fairy tale found in the young adult and juvenile shelves yet i question that classification as there s a graphically adult scene disturbing as explained in spoiler further below major spoilers are tagged and hidden daughter of the forest is an über extended take on the six swans set in medieval ireland when druidic and christian cultures first started to overlap s

5081,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,amazing if i wasn t sure before this book solidifies juliet marillier as one of my very favourite authors the story of sorcha and her trials as she works to free her six brothers from enchantment is painful and gut wrenching while it doesn t all result in a traditional fairy tale ending the story does deliver what feels right and more true to our own experiences no one can live through what sorcha and her brothers do without being irrevocably changed marillier s writing is perfect as usual
5082,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,as often happens i feel rather inadequate when it comes to reviewing something so beautifully written and emotionally demanding this is a retelling of a celtic myth the six swans a mix of folklore and fantasy historical fiction and romance daughter of the forest is the first of a trilogy of num books it seems this book isn t fantasy in the way of most it isn t filled with invented kingdoms or massive battles it follows sorcha seventh daughter and only child of lord collum as she suffe
5083,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,i just want to say that i have very mixed feelings about this book it is one of my favorite love stories of all time it is not some mere trite story it is meaningful and deep however be warned it does have what i have referred to before as content there is a part near the beginning where she is abused skip it there is a part at the very end after they are married there you go so if you read it and want to come away unscathed be careful start at the part where red finds her maybe s
5084,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,1,i would not recommend it especially to young adults the story was beautifully woven and the writing is very engrossing but there is graphic description of abuse that did not strengthen the book and was very unnecessary it pretty much ruined the book for me

5089,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,i went from to this to this to this there are books that you take little sips from then are those you devour… this a little bit of both it’s intricately told with a cast of characters each as nuanced as the other that i couldn’t help but get drawn in that it’s lengthy is of no issue in fact i loved that aspect of it particularly since it allowed the reveal of who was close to whom and which sibling had what role but this is mainly about sorcha though youngest of the seven among whom
5090,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,3,i am a great lover of fantasy but i am discovering that i prefer my fantasy books to be original and not based on fairy tales one notable exception being cinder and its sequels fairy tales are known for their cruelty and hardship and daughter of the forest is quite relentless in this respect it may be that the book was just a bit too long and sorcha s tedious task seemed to take forever however i was uncomfortable with several of the scenes and wished they had not occurred i won t be cont

5103,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,daughter of the forest is an absorbing heart breaking story it s a retelling of the classic fairytale of the wild swans and it doesn t gloss over the darker implications wallowing in the misery of them is more like it in ireland in the time of the druids sorcha is a healer and a true child of the forest each of her six brothers is distinctly drawn and the bonds of love and loyalty between them are firmly established tangible almost as everything falls apart their closeness makes the

5108,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,i am a huge fan of fairy tales however i think that the ones i am drawn to the most tend to fit into two categories i love the dark realistic retellings with grey characters that are both villains and heroes and endings where nothing is truly resolved i also love the black and white versions with clear cut uber villains and endings chock full o’ sweet sweet comeuppance this book is somewhere in between those two extremes although i really liked it i found myself alternately wishing for m

5116,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,this was an interesting mix of heroic journey in this case heroine journey fantasy and romance who would have thought that a plot that requires the protagonist be unable to speak for much of the book would still be able to draw in the reader i will say that i did have to deduct points for the book being more descriptive of non consensual sex than of consensual sex why do some authors do that however i did like that the book ended with not everyone and everything living happily ever aft

5133,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,in three words enchanting lyrical moving do not judge too quickly that which you cannot understand some books are slow and some books are really slow daughter of the forest definitely falls into the latter category to the point where if i hadn t been enjoying the story immensely i would have described it as painfully slow but actually the slow style was beautifully done although it did take me a few chapters to get completely absorbed it meant that we learned a lot about the pro
5134,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,this was the first fantasy book i ever read so there was a fair amount of nostalgic enjoyment i got out of the re reading or in this case listening i have to admit that i never read all the books in this series and this is something i want to rectify this year the framework of this first instalment is a little bit like a reimagined grimm fairy tale we have a wicked stepmother who casts a spell with only one person that can break this spell but it will take courage tears and sacrifice the

5138,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,currently rereading thoughts from num this book is different of any other book i ve ever read the mythology was very refreshing and interesting although the part where sorcha is torturing herself by making the shirts could have been less extensive still red is a great character and i fell in love with him immediatly i will read the other sevenwaters books very soon 
5139,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,2,while the prose is very good and the world easy to get immersed into neither the storyline nor the characters are that good as marillier s remarkable storytelling talent would usually lead one to expect the retelling hasn t worked for me but i still like this author

5146,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,to say that i enjoyed this book would be a gross understatement i was absolutely amazed with it the story used to be one of my favorite fairytales as a kid and i m glad that this version stayed so close to it and also managed to expand so well outside the original tale sorcha is an amazing heroine and the hero well he s awesome knowing the fairytale i knew how this would end and yet i was actually anxious while reading the last pages wondering if she d make the shirts on time i will ad

5165,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,once more i m breaking my review moratorium in this case it s because this book is exceptional this is a historical fiction/fantasy grounded in celtic welsh mythology set primarily in ireland but building on a tale from the mabinogion it has far less fantasy than a song of ice fire yet the fantastic is integral to its plot in a way that it is not in martin s writing the fair folk are the gods of the celts the druids are irish and christianity exists but isn t period accurate
5166,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,2,num num stars the only thing that kept me going was the five star ratings that plague this book i thought that the ending must be great to warrant such thoughts alas i couldn t enjoy the story at all despite coming in with a super positive and expectant attitude although you can definitely see the detail in which the author puts in characterization and the great relationship between sorcha and her brothers there s no arguing the fact that the book is so damn slow that i couldn t enjoy it like

5169,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,this is a super dense book it took me a while to get through it even though in page count it isn t as long as some books the pacing is steady but slow and builds to a really incredible and bittersweet ending i cried like a baby through the last quarter of the book or so it s been a long time since i ve read a fantasy book that is as nuanced and heartbreaking and hopeful as this one i really like the earthy magic and emphasis on fables and fairy tales i was going to give this four stars

5208,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,all words fail me when trying to describe how amazing daughter of the forest is i found myself drawn deep into a fantasy world filled with unyeilding love promise torment and devotion like no other the trials that sorcha and her six brothers withstand are unbelievable the people sorcha comes into contact with on her journey and how deeply she affects their lives are breathtaking i ve never read anything like daughter of the forest and cannot wait to get lost in this beautiful world again

5212,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,this is the second time juliet marillier has kept me up past dawn finishing a book of hers i don t know what it is about her books that make them so captivating marillier always seems to start off so slowly that i m not sold immediately on the story but by midpoint it s like somehow my fingers/eyes are glued to the book and i can t for the life of myself get myself to stop reading i think it s because everything is so vivid it s like i m actually there in the story and i have to see it to

5217,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,3,i really wanted to like this book more than i actually did it had all of the right elements a strong girl magic adventure a destiny to fulfill and romance however the book was just too long the text was dense and cumbersome at points i had to force myself to get through it this novel had such high ratings but for me it fell flat plus there was so much left at the end unresolved i still gave this a num because it is a good story but it could have been so much better 
5218,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,this was my first book by juliet marillier and wow what an experience the audio version narrated by terry donnelly was so filled with raw emotion it brought me to tears many times a beautiful retelling of the six swans by the brothers grimm

5227,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,2, there is no good or evil save in the way you see the world there is no dark or light save in your own vision rating num num stars juliet marillier tells a story of a reserved and protected girl forced out of her element in search of answers but finding only a curse and bad luck i’m not particularly impressed with this book it is an average yet interesting fantasy for me although the author’s writing style is filled with scenic imagery the story gets bogged down in too much description
5228,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,reading this book felt like i was undertaking sorcha s task along with her it was so long and so upsetting and many times i wanted to give up because even though i wanted to know what happened i knew it would be hundreds of pages until i got there it was only at about page num that i really couldn t stop reading which is probably the longest it s ever taken me to get into a book i ll admit i was bored for at least the first num pages still this book is so beautifully written the prose is

5233,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,3,the setting felt very magical and fairy tale like being a blend of irish english and german folklore but do not go into this book expecting fluff the obstacles sorcha faces are the stuff of hurt fanfiction i m not being sarcastic i like fanfction the way that her brothers treat her like she s their responsibility but not their equal even after she saves them really shows how even the most important men in a woman s life will fail to save her or give comfort when needed for that reaso

5245,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,3,{spoilers} i initially thought i would give it num stars but theres something about the story that makes me want to read the next book despite the things i disliked so i m giving it num num and rounding it to num stars i liked the atmosphere marillier s style of writing and the way she built the world but the storyline lacked and perhaps a third of the way through it started to become a chore to read i think it was too simplistic and needed to be expanded plot wise the characters were very unreali

5248,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,no review i do could ever do this book true justice the writing is beautiful and so too is the story i had not known about the swans myth prior to reading this and so i came into it not knowing what to expect aside from what the summary states but what i found i quickly fell in love with marillier interweaves fantasy and historical fiction so well that i almost expect to see fair folk in celtic history books i was fully enthralled throughout the tale and i barely wanted to put the book down
5249,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,i was one of those kids i’m sure you’ve known a few of us who read our complete grimm brothers’ fairy tales cover to cover until the book was in tatters among the hundreds of extraordinary—and admittedly some not so extraordinary—tales however the one about the girl who must endure great travails to free her six older brothers who have been turned into swans has always been one of my favorites because it’s just so emotional and the girl is so admirable happily juliet marillier keeps m

5252,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,i ll start by saying that i read this book without knowing it was a retelling of an ancient celtic fairytale called the six swans since i m not familiar with this tale it was all new to me i did like this story very much although as with some other reviewers it did take me a long time to read it the book has beautiful descriptions but at times i found myself not needing that much detail my mind would wander off wondering where the story was going and rather hoping it would get on wi

5256,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,three chapters in when i picked up this book all the reviews seemed to focus on its being based on a fairy tale currently i m just really enjoying the setting and the characters and have almost completely forgotten this fairy tale basis having finished the book things i liked the setting psudo historical setting made me happy and sad thinking of a magical past world that is now gone and in the context of the story must inevitably come to an end the first person perspective i liked the
5257,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,i have mixed feelings regarding the daughter of the forest for once it was tormenting and heart wrenching to read full of suffering and disbelief at the amount of pain the main character and her brothers had to go trough it was almost to much to bear for me torn between the want to toss the book in a corner and the need to go on reading it was not all about suffering though it was about magic and fairies the good and the bad kind a wild old land and ancient traditions it was about fate
5258,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,3,i have mixed feelings about this book on one hand the six swans is one of my favorite tales ever on the other hand i didn t really enjoy this book yes it was nicely written the characters the descriptions everything was ok but it simply didn t click for me also the fact that it was an exact retelling made it boring the story was embellished and given more details but in essence everything was the same i kept thinking of cinder s retelling of cinderella and how i felt so hap

5260,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,this was one of the best books i have read in a long time though at first the story moved a little slowly it gradually picked up the pace and had me hooked throughout the entire novel there were so many plot twists it was wonderful because i never knew what was going to happen next i absolutely loved the characters and the concept of lords and ladies from history the reader can really see the development of each characters personalities from the beginning of the novel to the end readin

5263,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,3,i never read the same book twice so i thought it would be a good idea to listen to some of my old favorites but unfortunately this also does not work for me i think there are a few reasons for this my brain keeps telling me that i already know this story and that there are sooo many new ones out there also i read this many many moons ago it was my first fantasy novel that i enjoyed and i think i ve read many other and different fantasies which i can now compare to obviously i have al

5266,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,5,num stars for this book i really didn t quite know what to expect when i started reading this book i thought it might be silly and far fetched and i didn t know if i would like it but you know what it was really good the authors writing was wonderful almost poetic at times and her ability to tell this story was fantastic it s one of those books that you just have to let go and open your mind to the story i enjoyed the myth and magic of this celtic retelling of the swans 
5267,Daughter of the Forest,Juliet Marillier,4,i really liked this one i didn t give it num stars because at times it was a bit too wordy for me but then i often have the attention span of a goldfish i am more tuned into love stories with a bit more um activity ahem however this tale kept me captivated and i just spent the last num hours huddled in a blanket on my deck on a most beautiful fall day finishing it

5292,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,1,i m going to go out on a limb here and say that this book was the one that put me off fantasy for years afterwards part of me was slightly interested in how the whole thing was going to end but it was over ruled by the knowledge of nine books at the time after this one that i was going to have to push through the story itself is such a fantasy cliche kid finds out he s the chosen one has to defeat the big bad i liked that story the first couple of times i read it the characters are unlik

5299,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,it took me ages to finish the last quarter as i was away from the book for about num months but mostly it wasn t the book s fault it s my first time around so my review is as much objective as a review can be devoid of any nostalgic factors the book has some problems but i did enjoy it as a whole i should mention that i listened to the audiobook edition narrated by michael kramer and kate reading who did a very good job in narrating the book the bad the first problem i d like to pinpoint i
5300,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,3,when i used to work at a bookstore my coworkers and future husband and i used to joke that robert jordan hated trees those poor shelves groaning under the weight of such immensely long books it d have to be a damned good story to justify that much prose note the rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the recent changes in goodreads policy and enforcement you can read why i came to this decision here in the meantime you can read the entire review at smorgasbook

5306,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,executive summary this is the book that really kindled my love for epic fantasy i was worried that after reading hundreds of fantasy novels and getting tired of the chosen one trope this book might not hold up to my memory of it i was happy to find that i had nothing to worry about as i enjoyed it just as much on a reread as i did the first time audiobook one of my main reasons for doing a reread was the chance to do the audio version michael kramer and kate reading were already among my f
5307,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,did a re read of this book with the crew at fantasy buddy reads and i must say i have absolutely no regrets i remember when my sister started reading these books she was sixteen and i was eight years old at the time and the idea of reading anything other than the magic tree house books was daunting to me much less this massive and classic work of epic fantasy i basically wanted to be my older sister when i was little haha me and my six siblings were all homeschooled we were and still
5308,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,i really enjoyed this entire series as far as i ve read into it at any rate but then i read the essay quality in epic fantasy by alec austin in strange horizons magazine http //www strangehorizons com/ and i found out why i was so drawn into it and then i was just kinda sad here is an excerpt emphasis mine i will refer to the two easiest means of extending a fantasy series beyond its natural lifespan as the jordan method and the eddings method though neither method is exclusive to
5309,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,this was solid fantasy even if there wasn t really anything new we have the chosen one who reluctantly embarks on the journey with a company of nine eight comprised of a magic user who’s not a bearded guy hurray and a warrior with a past the reveal here was painfully obvious considering what we’re comparing it to and several of his hometown friends and whose ultimate destiny is to fight the evil one sounds familiar of course it does it follows campell’s theory of the journey of
5310,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,good ol fantasy at its best if this would have been published today it would be cast off as derivative unoriginal or full of tropes shrug i kinda liked that i read fantasy because i enjoy it not every single book needs to be genre shattering sometimes i do enjoy the whole farmer boy leaves village in search of a grand adventure course it helps that robert jordan does it very very well the writing quality impressed me and i m eager to continue the series and see how the world buildin
5311,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,2,i should have gone with malazan like all my friends suggested dnf num the beginning was promising but i just cannot continue with this series i will not invest num num num page books of my life into characters i loathe the ultimate reason i decided not to give it any further chance or any more of my time was reviews reviews of the second book i found all the negative reviews were in line with how i am feeling right now and there was little that gave me confidence things will change that lan and
5312,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,for a very very long time this series has intimidated the hell out of me i first started hearing about it sometime in the late nums at that time there were seven or eight books out less than the fourteen that finalized the series but i was scared as hell because they are doorstoppers and there was no end in sight i worried that the series would never end i worried that it d suck and i d be stuck reading thousands of pages of books that i hated this was back in my must finish everythin
5313,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,2,oh this book i have certainly read books that were filled with unreadably bad prose which this isn’t i have read books with abysmal dialogue and nothing but preposterous scenes this book doesn’t have those it’s not by any means close to being the worst book i’ve ever read and yet i found myself continually frustrated by it perhaps the frustration is due to the fact that it came so highly recommended and has appeared — as has the whole series on many lists of the best fantasy novels of
5314,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,finally this book has been on my shelf for over ten years patiently waiting for me to pick it up first the bad things well not really bad but the things i noticed that i wouldn t praise the typical trope is of course right in the middle of the story young boy finds himself to be chosen jordan without a doubt used tolkien as inspiration and in parts blatantly copied him the characters travel a lot and if they don t travel they are running away to the point where i thought please get
5315,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,hard to believe i purchased this book num years ago in a grocery store back then since i didn t have such a wonderful website to help me find the next great novel to read i followed cover artists if a book had cover art by michael whelan or darrell k sweet and was in the fantasy genre i would scan the synopsis and usually purchase it and so starts the love/hate relationship i now have with the wheel of time series when i first started reading this novel i had no idea that num years later
5316,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,3,done finally it s actually not that bad or rather not as bad as i anticipated the first half or so is hard to get through if you can t get past all the tolkien homages they were basically what i couldn t put aside every time i started this book only to abandon it a few days later but the second half is a lot better especially in terms of pacing and action i found myself much more invested in the story once i figured out what the end game was and also once i stopped comparing it to th
5317,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,i really liked this book when i read it but at that time i had never read anything by j r r tolkien except for the first half of the hobbit which i have read four times now and for whatever reason never finished i guess i just didn t like it all that much so i had planned to spend the next year or two reading the entirity of the wheel of time and this seemed like a strong start then book num the shadow rising sucked and i stopped and read lord of the rings and now i just view this as a
5318,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,this review applies to the entire series i think it s ludicrous to claim any close similarity between the wheel of time and lord of the rings the only similarities i see are num they are in the fantasy genre and num they are among the best in their genre the writing quality is excellent many characters are extensively developed the world building is very detailed the magic system is average but at least the male/female separation of power sources is something different my only problem is wit
5319,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,the wheel of time turns… and i am now on the wheel what a kitten squisher of a book i had the hardcover edition from the library when i fell asleep reading it the thump as the book landed in my lap would wake me every time not that this was a boring book just that i’ve been having sleep issues lately i hope to take a little breather from the wheel before i head on to book num but i will need to move on while i still remember who’s who this is one of the better swords and horses fantasies
5320,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,what a long read up to now i ve read and heard enough about this series that i know it d be a very long long journey for me to finish it but at least i ve started right and despite my ever dislike toward over num pages books i can say i liked it i think jordan creation of this world can finally fill the empty space i felt after finishing tolkien s lord of the rings and his middle earth i won t write anything about the story as i m sure everybody knows it but i ll probably edit this review l
5321,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,3,i learned something about myself while reading this book i like really simplistic fantasy i like lord of the rings the hobbit and this well i ll be fuckin damned thing is jordan was a good writer even if his pacing is terrible better than some of the other fantasy authors i ve tried and failed to finish though like that goodkind dude and all his excessive exclamation marks my favorite characters were moiraine nynaeve and perrin i couldn t give two fucks on wet cement about rand and

5324,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,after rereading this book for a third time i have decided that this review needs a drastic makeover so here we go time to trim the overgrown shaggy hair on this beast get it a new wardrobe and maybe add a touch of mascara for subtle aesthetics my original review i kept at the end i first picked up the wheel of time in the seventh grade when i did not even know what i was reading literally this copy had no cover and it was only the first half of the eye of the world why someone would
5325,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,when it comes to cliche expressions my favorite may be life s a journey not a destination to be honest i m a pretty goal oriented person but expressions like life s a journey remind me to seize the day in a way that take time to smell the roses or getting things done doesn t journeys and destinations are a big part of the fantasy reader s experience in my humble opinion the weaker fantasies draw us towards a destination and the better ones allow us to revel in the moment i thin

5327,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,i don t want to speak too soon because there are still num books left in the series that i need to get to but i think this might just be a new favourite series of mine tbqh rating might change after more thought but i was really pleasantly surprised by how much i enjoyed this i didn t go into the book expecting to hate it or anything but there are always these feelings of wariness whenever i dip my toes into classic fantasy and classic scifi racism homophobia and sexism oh my there we

5340,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,i’d always put off reading this series due to the mixed reviews and supposed similarity to lord of the rings with a varied opinion of it being a rip off i try not to be manipulated by other reviewers book opinions but when the ‘lotr plagiarism’ is referenced in num of what i read it’s hard not to be having recently finished the malazan book of the fallen i was ready to delve into another epic multi book fantasy series that most importantly was finished i didn’t want another situation where

5344,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,3,firstly i liked this i really did i am completely susceptible to these kinds of stories and jordan seems like a smart and enthusiastic kind of writer guy however a lot of this didn’t work for me and i have lots and lots of thoughts although i don’t know how many i will be able to remember and/or actually articulate in this space i consider myself pretty well read in terms of the fantasy genre i’ve read a little bit of everything and i’m determined to read all the classics but somehow

5355,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,3,after a grueling experience that i have overcome the tale was rather good however this book came with much annoyance frustration and pure stupidity the characters are so childish and immature you cannot help but for the thousandth time roll your eyes also the plot came with scenes that went on for decades or so it seemed it had to be explained everything from the ground to the sky for pages and pages and pages of just one scene how boring the writing was also not a very well pro to th
5356,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,this is the best book i have read in a long time one of the main appeals in this book is that it satisfies our longing to be more than we are that idea parallels tolkien’s idea of insignificant hobbits performing deeds that shake the foundations of the earth although jordan openly admitted to a little tolkien emulation similarities to the lord of the rings in no way detract from the grandeur of the eye of the world in the basketball world it is difficult to talk about kobe bryant without al

5362,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,it is with some conflicting emotions that i’m approaching this review i really enjoyed this book despite all the criticism levelled against it indeed this novel does follow the lord of the rings recipe perhaps even more faithfully than did the sword of shannara however much like the shannara series the tale veers off into it’s own direction once the opening scenes have rolled by so it is agreed then eotw is a lotr clone but and this is a very big but i fail to see how this is such
5363,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,so does the wheel of time stand the test of time yes it does it is now one of the classics of high/epic fantasy the world building is truly impressive but the real value in this series is the arc of the larger story it considers the winding gyre / wheel of fate of myth history and social development showing how the same stories are told over and over and how even characters repeat but how small changes in person and plot can have the largest of significance that is why it is impo

5366,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,exactly num years ago when i just got aquainted with social media a colleague of mine posted an update in fb about finishing a massive series which had num books seeing that being a beginner at reading with very minimal fantasy experience i was awed and i decided that someday i should read this entire wheel of time series as time went by this kept popping up and i kept postponing thanks to manu i finally picked up this massive series and it didnt disappoint me though reading re

5368,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,num num/num stars well this is a very promising start to the wheel of time series this book is by no means perfect and there definitely were some sections that dragged on a bit to long but for the most part i was riveted and immersed in the fascinating world that robert jordan has created the characters were realistic and believable and for the most part likeable i wish i saw more of a few of the characters and at certain points i became annoyed at the characters for being dumb/oblivious i am exc
5369,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,ok so i think it s time i was honest with myself and admit to the fact that i won t be reviewing this book this is for personal reasons i do normally review every book i read but i just can t face doing this one however i will be reading the sequel the great hunt soon so when i do i ll being including some thoughts on the series so far when that happens i ll include the link below 
5370,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,num stars review to come
5371,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,3,dnf num no one can ever condemn me for trying and screw all you fantasy enthusiasts who praise robert jordan i tried my damn best to read the wheel of time series but this is not a promising start for a series that only gets worse in the middle only go gather itself back up again thanks to brandon sanderson may contain spoilers read at your own risk i ve been meaning to read this book ever since i saw it when i was in high school but the thing that never kept my interest was the way it wa
5372,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,3,okay so this book is just one huge prologue for whatever comes afterwards but i m so here for it like i just love how this book is written and the characters grew on my instantly sometimes the author describes a bit too much but whenever i think it s too much it stops and the plot goes forward i really appreciate that i enjoyed this read and how the plot is woven between so many unique and different characters while i still not understand why this series has fifteen book wtf in it i f
5373,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,3,first half of the book is num stars how many inns with bad guys can you visit even tolkien only had one prancing pony not fifteen of them then things pick up honestly i think the entire series probably could have been edited down way too much woolgathering but it s a fascinating world with so many interesting cultural influences and for me personally i m curious to see how jordan deals with the idea of circular time because i don t see how you can have a satisfactory conclusion with it
5374,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,3,an enjoyable first book that sets up an epic scale series it is frustratingly slow at times but does have a solid payoff with the final hundred pages or so picking this up with measured expectations is crucial i feel if you are picking this up with full knowledge that this is a huge series and will take a number of books to really get going then i think that eotw is a solid introduction and clearly sets up an epic story however if you re using this book to test whether or not it can con
5375,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,buddy read with the wonderful people from buddies books and baubles first i want to thank all of those who participated in the discussion thread without you i would have given up somewhere around the numth page this book has such a slow beginning but you kept my interest with your comments and little snippets from the forthcoming chapters and now when i ve finished the book i m truly grateful i won t rehash the plot it s way too complicated and honestly i can t do it justice so just read
5376,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,if i could give this more then num stars i would fantastic 
5377,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,if you enjoyed frank herbert’s dune you might try robert jordan’s ‘the eye of the world’ the beginning book for this massive dragon king series ‘the wheel weaves as the wheel wills ’ ‘the eye of the world’ is about fun mashups of real myths particularly from the hinduism buddhism the book kabbalah bible quran religions but changed by the author to suit his fictional fantasy world intricate and detailed world building and maps actions similar to those instigated by political groups in f
5378,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,my opinion is that this series of books is the best ever written in the field of high fantasy after tolkien s great works of course from the first time i read it it made me such a good impression that i m used to read it again and again so i can relive all the feelings that caused me for this opinion i can argue quite a lot but i think the best proof is this book i do not know where to begin to describe his virtues from its direct connection with the past of the genre from the incredible
5379,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,3,there is neither beginning nor end with a reread of the wheel of time it’s been a long time since i first read eye of the world and i don’t think i’ve ever reread the entire wheel of time series in order so instead of doing a “proper” review i’m just going to jot down random things and approach it from the point of view of someone who has read most of the series already but whose memory of certain things is somewhat hazy hella spoilers ahead most likely he said as if anybody reads these t
5380,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,the wheel turns what a delight of a book from beginning to end there are many brilliant ideas littered throughout this entire story and i enjoyed them all the prose was wonderful from beginning to end and i absolutely cannot wait to see where the series continues from here not many books truly encapsulate a journey but robert jordan does it to a tee and i can understand why some people didn t enjoy that but i thought it was terrific many more to go and i m in for the journey 
5381,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,the eye of the world is a spectacular novel though it is long and overly descriptive the novel is worth the hype i really enjoyed it the plot was awesome 
5382,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,3,my copy of the eye of the world came as a freebie in a goodie bag at a convention way back in the nums yes my cover actually has that mail in rebate offer if you buy this book and the great hunt by num/num/num it then spent several years sitting on the floor of my car and eventually made its way into a box and only recently resurfaced on my bookshelves i remember when i first encountered the book a friend of mine in the army was reading it i picked it up read the back cover and said ok
5384,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,forever a classic 
5388,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,the more i worked my way through this insanely addictive book the more i realised i had no choice but to read the rest of this entire series as soon as possible after finishing the worldbuilding was exquisite there were a lot of great characters introduced luckily they were all easily identifiable from each other and their role/importance in the book was clearly explained and there was a glossary at the back that was one of the most helpful and concise and brilliant glossaries i have ever
5389,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,i really enjoyed this book and to be honest its contents has left me interested not just in the world but the story as well as characters even if some of them are spoilt and i felt engrossed in the journey in this book seeing different places learning about different things and of history and i am glad to have read more classical fantasy adventures and enjoy them the only other is the dragonbone chair by tad williams and while i favour williams book more than jordan s i still enjoyed the eye o
5390,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,edit re read this two years after the first read and holy shit it feels so much better the foreshadowing the characters everything wheel of time might just be becoming my all time favorite series original review well i took my time reading this this being the vacation month one would think that i would have devoured hundreds of books already sadly though this is the only book i have read in the last three weeks been busy with stuff and all that i finally picked up this huge series
5391,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,num num stars another of the great books of the epic fantasy genre the plot isn t original innocent young farmboys venture out into the big bad world as one of them is the great chosen hero against the big evil but it s a story with a classic theme well told and the characterisation is absorbing as is the world building if you like fantasy you owe to yourself to read this book if you re just getting into fantasy start with lord of the rings and work your way around to this 
5392,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,i m glad i was talked into trying this book again i had to give into the rhythm of it a little but ended up enjoying the story and its many parts jordan is very talented at world building and i m curious about the dragon reborn as well as various relationships that are only hinted at in this first book of the series 
5393,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,1,i gave up some time during chapter four about two hours into the audiobook there was no way i could face spending another num hours on this book certainly not knowing there are another num novels to follow this is the first time i ever asked audible for my credit back nice service audible 
5394,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,3,original review written in may of num it has since been rewritten following a second reading of the text on december of num “the wheel of time turns and ages come and pass what was what will be and what is may yet fall under the shadow ” it has been two and a half years since i first tread the beginning chapters of the grand wheel of time saga that is around the same width of time between the last installment being released relative to me starting the series from then on i have un
5395,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,this is the first book in the wheel of time series i read the first four books about num years ago so this was a re read time constraints kept me from putting sufficient reading time into it the first time around and i had to give up even though i was enjoying them now that my schedule has been more stable i’ve decided to give it another try to give a really simplistic taste of what the first book is about for anybody who doesn’t already know… the story starts off in a tiny peaceful villag
5396,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,july num update in trying to introduce my husband to the series i ve now read this book four times crazy i didn t realize i had read it three times before already oh well technically though this time i listened to it as an audiobook so it was a different experience i ll probably continue to re read listen to the rest of the series now i m ridiculous i know deal with it a reviewer s dilemma i ve now read this book three times the first time i read it i must have loved it b
5397,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,“the wheel of time turns and ages come and pass leaving memories that become legend legend fades to myth and even myth is long forgotten when the age that gave it birth comes again ” light that s how an epic fantasy book i mean truly epic begins if jrr tolkien is the father of epic fantasy then robert jordan is the godfather with the eye of the world he created a whole new world where the forces of evil battle against the forces of the light where humanity faces eternal darkness a hopeless 
5398,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,it might have been a num but the feel that it s a retelling of the lord of the rings is just too strong a few random thoughts this could very well be a ya book as the main trio are in their late teens but it s way more layered and complex than any ya fantasy i ve ever read it starts out being interesting but not particularly remarkable it becomes truly captivating when the traveling party gets separated the attention to detail is astounding here s one sample despite his desire for haste
5399,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,this is where it all began for me i remember noticing a friend reading this absolutely huge book and being unable to resist getting a copy i was right it devoured an entire christmas vacation as i sat transfixed watching the characters begin a path that would call me back for a decade since i have read nearly the entire series i have to say that as a whole it dropped and knowing this i may not read this book again if i had a do over in this life sanderson did a fine job completing the dragg
5401,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,what a wonderfull start to an epic journey i really liked the eye of the world the slow pacing was actually good for me the characters slowly develop and it gives you time to get to know tchem the story itself nothing too original but thats perfectly fine because it was told in a very likeable way i dont really care about the similarities with tolkien they are there and they are obvious but they dont bother me ive seen this in many other books where people dont make such a big deal out o
5402,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,although it was glaringly obvious that many ideas in this book were taken from tolkien s lord of the rings christian especially or other religious concepts which often rang loud religious cliché bells i found it an enjoyable and entertaining fantasy adventure the world jordan created excuse me adapted was fun and exciting what would have made it better for me would have been a deeper philosophical dialog however as far as high fantasy goes this is one of the best i ve read t
5403,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,i like the story line in eotw but not the pace some long stretches of nothing and then quick but not well explained action i hope to see more human interaction in the next few books especially rand and egwene or lan and nynaive also i am disappointed in the glossary over half of what i try to look up is not in there and i was stumped on the eye of the world for most of the book was it a person a thing a place etc it finally got revealed at a level i could understand anyw
5405,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,this was my third or fourth time reading this book and i have to say it was absolutely the best because i got to experience it alongside my bestest buddy david the eye of the world is the first book in an absolutely monumentally epic fantasy series started by the late robert jordan and completed by brandon sanderson it has it all action adventure danger romance magic complex storylines and characters you really grow to care for any fans of the fantasy genre need to experience this saga
5406,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,i enjoyed this book a lot more than i ever thought i would honestly i feel like you can tell when an author knows his world backward and forward and jordan is definitely in that class thought the world building was excellent so many wonderful moments of feeling like i was right beside these characters in an inn or out on the road terrific stuff liked most of the characters though none have really jumped out as favorites yet maybe nynaeve and from what i ve read about mat i think i ll real
5407,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,2,this is one of those lessons that shouts there s no accounting for taste some of my best friends and readers who shared very similar reading tastes with me were wild about this series so i had started it with a high confidence that i would love it as well nope i found it pedantic and distant it s been many years since i ve read it but i felt essentially repulsed by the story/writing 
5408,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,january num buddy read with sanctum of fantasy
5409,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,honestly speaking this is my favorite book series of all time i haven t been able to bring myself to read any books after brandon sanderson took over i will someday but i just cant yet

5412,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,let the prince of the morning sing to the land that green things will grow and the valleys give forth lambs let the arm of the lord of the dawn shelter us from the dark and the great sword of justice defend us let the dragon ride again on the winds of time ” author unknown the forth age it is impossible to talk about the fantasy and high fantasy genre without coming across robert jordan and the wheel of time i have read criticisms of his work i have read praises i have seen reviews an
5413,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,read on the wondrousbooks blog where do i even begin with this i met a friend of a friend and we got talking about game of thrones the show then about the books and then he was all but have you read the wheel of time series which i had not so he gave me the first book telling me that it was the best fantasy ever i was not that excited to be honest i expected major disappointment which was great because therefore the book could not have let me down in any way but it went furt
5414,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,back around the time i graduated high school i wasn’t much of a reader the only books i had read voluntarily were pretty much holes and the lord of the rings having been a big fan of tolkien at that point i desperately searched out something similar to try and recapture the feeling i had reading him and watching the lord of the rings movies i first went the natural route many go to cs lewis’s chronicles of narnia which i mostly liked from there a friend had recommended shanara series by ter
5415,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,this review does contain spoilers to the eye of the world and while we will also mention a fair amount of foreshadowing for future installments we will not explain their meanings so first time readers will be able to enjoy this review as well without spoilers for the rest of the series an epic journey in the eye of the world readers are introduced to the main protagonists of the wheel of time rand al’thor mat cauthon and perrin aybara three average boys living in a backwater village calle
5416,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,1,i had heard amazing things about this series and i was always on the look out for a new tome in which to lose myself so i picked up a copy what i found inside was derivative and dull even to my little num year old mind i read the whole thing just to make sure it didn t get better it didn t and i never looked back 
5417,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,3,i hate long journeys whether on boat car or plane i hate travelling my legs get cramped and i get cranky impatient the eye of the world took me on a long journey horseback my ass was sore by the end sigh there were times when i thought the book was “a distinguished piece of fantasy literature” deserving num stars though for a majority of it i thought it was good num stars —not excellent nor great just good i bought the first three wheel of time books on boxing day amen to my fav hol
5418,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,3,so i did it i read the first book in the mammoth wheel of time series i understand that my three star rating of this book may be a point of contention for wheelies© a name i came up with you re welcome however the first book in any epic fantasy series is always a tough read i gave the blade itself num stars and i love the first law trilogy so what did this book have going for it the heavily celtic inspired world which is really interesting and deep this world has thousands and thousand
5419,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,3,this one is very hard for me to rate it took me soooo long to finish it i started it and then didn t pick it up again for several months months but when i did i was determined to finish it for fantasy lovers this book stands up with lord of the rings the hobbit etc it has elements of a game of thrones in it but it is not similar in most ways to got at times the eye of the world was a little too analogous with those other works i know there are certain things that naturally come alon
5420,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,i just re read the series this year the series is spectacular and the world that jordan creates is greatly detailed and absorbing what really makes this series special is the political intrigues a history to rival the simarillion and characters that as you read the books build a certain fondness personally i like the idea of the void its basically the same concept that professionals in sports such as basketball or target shooting where one enters a state of hyper concentration and the bal
5421,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,i remember reading this back in numth grade and thinking it was great but as the series progressed i felt overwhelmed by jordan s writing and ended up dropping the series after the fifth book now my friends have been urging me for a while to pick the wheel of time back up and read with them and i finally said yes i m so glad i did i love this book even more than the first time i read it it just has that classic epic fantasy feel to it there s not much originality to it but i still couldn
5422,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,oh mr jordan how far you have fallen the first num books of this series are intricate fascinating and full of breath taking tableaus what happened from the numth book onward the quality went downhill i gave up around book num or num i think he s on book num now he s seriously milking this tale for all it s worth from the framework of a neverending cycle the wheel we follow the small group of men and women who have roles in the current struggle against the big bad guy traveling through di
5423,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,i guess this is the benchmark for epic fantasy running at num books plus a prequel with the final book to be published in january num the series is certainly epic extremely long with a number of heroes and heroic deeds the tale starts in a backwater district called the two rivers moiraine an aes sedai wielder of the one power and her warder lan arrive in emond s field searching for a young man under the scutiny of the dark one moiraine is unable to determine which of three youths rand mat
5424,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,after much hesitation i have finally decided to start this series that will stay with me for fourteen books i was immediately charmed by the style and the atmosphere rich of descriptions and details of course now originality in fantasy is not so easily and here we have a company on the road a chosen one the evil is awakened this reminds you of something but i must say i really liked the way the author has created this world its people their stories customs and legends that form th
5425,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,limerick at the end contrary to all logic i started this series with book num then i read num through num and finally i went back to the first before moving on now this is a very tolkienesque work in many aspects it s very coming of age plus the handsome dose of epic lore that builds the series not bad but a little naive and less intense than what comes after once again all of what i m writing here is actually an almost num year old memory and not my current observation of the series as of
5426,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,massive in every sense of the word robert jordan s eye of the world begins one of fantasy s most read and well loved or loathed series with a strong sense of adventure furiously driven by every shade of darkness under the sun as the young heroes of the series haltingly step into the boots of destiny challenged by pacing at times the eye of the world resonates well as an accessible stand alone fantasy novel with numerous classicist elements while in the same token promises a thick slathe
5428,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,1, the magic system is abysmal and i don t know if the females attitude in the book is a reflection of the fact that only them can use magic or it s some deep issues the writer had in his own life where all the men are wimps and idiots and all the women are those all knowing geniuses who can use their glares and raised voices to make men squirm like rabbit and yeah i almost forgot there is no story after finishing the series review i take all of that back
5429,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,2,num num numish enjoyed this more than i originally did the first time i tried to read it definitely a little slow and just too long in general but we ll see how the next one goes i can see myself getting into this world and these characters more and more 
5431,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,this is one of my top three epic fantasies and when i got another chance to read it i couldn t resist buddy read with some awesome people at sanctum of fantasy
5432,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,what a way to end my reading challenge eye of the world whew that was good to my regret i delayed starting this series for far too long i think i shall jump right into the next book 
5434,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,3,num num stars review to come i guess nothing much to review there s much to rant about though and while i frame my rant i think i m done with fantasy for a while except rereads like harry potter robin hobb s rote series and cosmere i m sorta repulsed by the hero goes on a journey stuff because unless such stories do well in multiple aspects they suck this book does everything below average so i m tired of these usual fantasy stories of fallen gods eternally trapped evil rediscoveri
5435,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,i ll come right out and say it i have been reading fantasy books for over num years and have finished well over num num fantasy books this is the best fantasy book ever written it is perfect in every way and that makes me sad because i know what s to come i ll back up and give you my background with the wheel of time i bought this book in january of num right when it was first released and i loved it so i bought each wheel of time book the day it was released in hardcover right up until b
5436,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,2,after countless praises i heard about these books being the ultimate fantasy series that beats even middle earth i finally sat down to read the first book guess what it’s nowhere near as good as middle earth starting with the title of the series itself i didn’t like how time moves in an infinite loop it made everything feel predetermined like the characters are not choosing what they will do next as much as repeating the same events again and again i also didn’t like how the hero in the i
5438,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,2,so robert jordan since brevity is the soul of wit i shan t be as wordulent as he in summarily dubbing the wheel of time the most obese hero s journey that i ever held the futile hopes of reading in its entirety but i finished this volume and it only took two tries and a whole lot of willpower i even kind of liked this one most of the time note i m reviewing six or seven years after having read the book the details are sketchy so i ll talk mostly in impressions i enjoyed the way jord
5439,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,i did it i finally did it i finished this ginormous book my geeky friends have been bugging me for years to read it and i ve been dragging my feet for a variety of reasons well the book didn t get any shorter obviously but once i finally gave it a chance i discovered that this is not the drearily epic saga i was expecting but a relatively engaging high fantasy adventure yes the tone and pacing are ponderous and yes jordan writes women rather oddly for my taste but the world buildi
5440,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,a non stop fan freaking tastic chase of epic proportions i first read eye of the world when i was in high school almost num years ago i remembered loving it then and it did not disappoint when i picked it back up again recently i am determined to finish the series now that the final book will be released this coming january it is a captivating story with characters that grip onto you and don t let go in this particular first volume the three main characters are rand perrin and mat all of the
5441,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,for me as for many of us of a certain age this was my gateway into the world of fantasy and this first book of the wheel of time series can always transport me back to that time i remember when the genre felt new and exciting and like nothing else i had ever read this was my first love and it started me off on a road i have been on ever since how can you rate your childhood you can t how can you review something that meant so much to you you can t how can you critique something that
5442,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,i loved this book which sets up the beginning of the end of one age and the start of the next we follow a group for young people from the two rivers as they set out with moiraine and lan who can protect them moiraine is an wielder of the true source magic and has been hunting for rand for a long time i like the characters in this book but the women can be a bit annoying the boys rand mat and perrin are ok stubborn but all trying to cope with what life is dealing them egwyne is one i m n
5443,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,3,i m actually pretty astonished that i picked up this book in the first place i mean i had it on my tbr pile because it s one of the first on the aficionado list and i should really learn to trust that thing better but being a hefty and somewhat obscure fantasy tome i had pushed it to the back yeah i know i should know better than that anyway i saw a paperback version poking out from a pile at a used bookstore and i knew i couldn t resist the cover art looked really cute anyway it ki
5444,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,the eye of the world is the first in a fantasy series that has num total books the first eleven are written by robert jordan and books num/num/num are written by brandon sanderson i ve seen many different reviews on this book some people love it but don t want to continue on in the series because books down the road from what i ve seen have been bad and some people don t like this series because they say it s to similar to j r r tolkien the lord of the rings you do follow a lot of different
5446,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,1,first reaction so far kind of lol last reaction i didn t actually finish the book but i am done with the book another goodreads reviewer mentioned that tolkien is a simplified derivative of nordic legend and that jordan is a simplified deviation of tolkien jordan however manages to still take an incredibly long time to tell his simplified story i would agree with that the book isn t awful and if your a die hard fantasy genre lover maybe it will do it for you but it is sort of dull and o
5447,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,[num stars] this was a very traditional tolkien fantasy but regardless of that i still quite enjoyed it the pacing of this book was a little strange it would be slow and then fast and then slow again and then towards the end things were just moving at a breakneck speed that being said i enjoyed both the action packed moments and the slower world building moments this seems more than anything like a set up kind of novel which really just introduces us to the world and the characters and the
5449,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,the wheel of time put the wtf are you shitting me num novels in epic fantasy that was the main reason i was hesitant to start this series i ve always had commitment issues and wasn t sure this was a series i wanted to settle down with oh well i took the plunge and end up really liking the story big and sprawling with wonderful world building and a great cast of characters i m still not sure how far i am willing to go with this series but for the moment we are getting along and ha
5450,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,2,this series lures you in the author is a passable world builder but the at some point for me the ninth book i m slow you realize num all the women are cookie cutter characters num the only character you liked spent an entire novel buried under a wall num the whole series is one long sexual fantasy and num the man has written himself into a corner has no idea where the story is going and is terrified that s when i stopped reading took all the hardback books it s an addiction to a second han
5451,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,beginning my epic re read of wheel of time series so i can read the last one when it releases this fall it s hard not to give num of num stars to a fantasy series that s had me in its grip for several decades and which i ve read the first five or six of over and over again despite any quibbles i may have with the books and the series robert jordan created something almost timeless and amazing and i love that

5457,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,2,you know i wanted to like this book i really did i had heard a lot of awful things about this series and author before i started but a lot of good things also from comments on other reviews of the wheel of time series it s something that stirs up a lot of strong emotions negative or positive for my part it was okay kind of sums up my response i could go on about the similarities to tolkien as others have done so but i feel that the similarities lessen the further you get into the
5458,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,reviewing a legendary fantasy novel is a little intimidating there is a lot of imagined pressure to fall head over heels with it unfortunately this wasn t the case for me i thoroughly enjoyed this adventure but i never really fell in love along the way a large part of that was character relationships which i ll get back to people who live in small towns off the beaten path generally consider themselves safer than other people in the world but when the biggest of the bads comes hunting
5461,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,5,this is the fifth time i’ve read this book keep in mind that i’m the type of person who rarely watches a movie or reads a book a second time the eye of the world by robert jordan is the book that drew me into the reading world and now the writing world i’d read maybe ten novels before this one usually because they were required reading for school i don’t remember the exact times but it took me almost three months to read the first num pages or so then i read the next num in a matter of da

5464,The Eye of the World,Robert Jordan,4,the eye of the world tew by robert jordan isn t very original it is the standard heroic adventure with a standard group of friends/allies in a tolkienesque journey what it lacks in originality it makes up for with execution while none of the characters are paragons of uniqueness their stories and the potential scope of this tale is well done the villain is essentially satan who has been locked away in shayol ghul and is trying to break free the other elements of the story from the aes s

5475,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,when i was younger i was always confused by the moniker of adult fantasy less used today but more common decades ago i assumed it meant sexy sextime and possibly ultra violence but that was never the case what it ended up meaning to me was boring i can t finish this well now that i am clearly an adult i get it for example curse of chalion this is definitely an adult fantasy it does not feature sex if anything it is rather pleasingly old fashioned and discreet about sex and i
5476,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,funny thing halfway through this book i found myself thinking about what it is that makes bujold s writing so distinctive in the world of science fiction and fantasy she s another one of these writers who straddles both worlds and it suddenly came to me that she was like jane austen interested most of all in people and their relationships in constraint ridden societies after finishing the book i glance idly at the about the author blurb on the inside back jacket and it says that people o

5478,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,the first time i read this i was torn between my respect for bujold and the slow burning plot of this first fantasy i had ever read by her it didn t hurt that it was nominated for the hugo as she had been nominated over and over winning several for her classic sf series but i was like what fantasy but she s so excellent with sf why switch and then when i started reading it there were none of the fast paced elements or larger than life characters that i expected in fact other than t

5480,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,really three and a half stars a slow start for me but sometimes good stories take a while to build and by the end i couldn t put it down there is an interesting mix of characters somewhat archetypical but done well enough that they developed uniqueness a feudal system a failing monarch an unscrupulous chancellor a strong minded but elderly female ruler young heirs running wild but all with twists that give them individuality i do appreciate the hero cazaril being developed more al
5481,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,fantasy books these days are often rough they swear they rape they mutilate and pillage they are dark or grimdark or realistic i like this trend a lot but once in a while there comes a book that is none of that enter the curse of the chalion this book is polite it s quiet and beautiful perhaps sophisticated sometimes it tells a great story and has a very relatable and likeable main protagonist cazaril our main character and only view point perspective is num in the course of the
5482,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,i am myself surprised at how much i liked this book generally i prefer books that are plot driven now and then however a wonderful book comes along built on the characters within this is definitely a character driven story there is about this story much of the way a melancholy feel of the inevitable doomed hero moving inexorably toward his fate to go on here about whether said hero meets said fate and so on would constitute of course the spoiler of all spoilers let me say however that

5489,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,3,num num stars this is a well written story filled with politics adventures blessings and magic the main plot was straightforward and enjoyable although the prominence of gods and curses undermined the importance of the characters while making the political machinations seem somewhat trivial the real strength of this book was in it s protagonist cazaril a decorated soldier his betrayal and imprisonment left him a shattered husk at the beginning of this novel more than a story of war and polit

5498,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,i realized something as i was reading this book many fantasy books when they involve any kind of court culture have as their viewpoint character someone who doesn t know how it works and blunders around until he or she figures it out it s relatively rare to have the main character be someone who does know exactly how things work cazaril the main character is such a man he isn t a quintessential courtier by any means but he knows how things work note the rest of this review has been wi

5501,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,i don’t know what anyone else looks for in their fantasy but for me the number one requirement is characters i care about this is hard to define of course i can’t describe what it is that creates emotional engagement in that way if i could i’d bottle it and sell it but i know it when i see it and cazaril is it indubitably and without question from the moment he walks onstage in his rags on page num he is a man i care deeply about someone i’m rooting for all the way he’s not great hero
5502,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,i loved this book so much and for so many reasons that i wish there was a num star rating i happened to listen to an audio version of this novel but i am considering reading it too just to take it apart and analyze under the microscope the writing style why because ms lois mcmaster bujold s technique is probably as close to artistry as modern writing gets let me start by saying that i read several reviews possible some of them were from amazon stating that the novel is too long and it shoul
5503,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,a lovely intimately told story of court intrigue and of the good people who are sorely tested to remain good in the midst of peril coming at them from all sides there are moments of beauty and lots of quiet good humor that are brought to vivid life by a sharply drawn and entirely believably human cast of characters this was my first bujold novel and it most certainly won’t be my last

5505,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,this was a wonderful fantasy definitely different than the normal run a unique theology take on it is the backbone of the tale so it s far more than just another hero hacking his way through the bad guys in fact if that s what you re looking for read a different book this one has complex politics a semi broken hero romance horror far more this broken hero is different than miles from her vorkosigan series in many ways but if you like those sf yarns you ll probably like t

5517,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,i loved this book here s why num court intrigue no one says what they mean people will do anything to gain the favor of the people of a higher rank than them there are a ton of rules of etiquette that must be followed all of the above gives an author so many opportunities with both subtle and not so subtle humour to show the various shades of human nature bujold was an absolute master with both the characters who set out to master all things courtly and even better at showing the people
5518,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,i must admit i am guilty of typecasting ms bujold i am a hardcore and dedicated fan of her vorkosigan series so i was a bit skeptical about this new non miles book i had a weird sense of displacement as i began to read it it took a chapter or two to stop it but i couldn t help trying to find miles somewhere in there miles isn t there but the elegant writing and exquisite prose that are a hallmark of ms bujold most certainly are while the plot of this book is not groundbreaking or even pa
5519,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,there are some books that i need to be in the right mood for this is not one of those the curse of chalion is one of the relatively few books that no matter what mood i may be in i can pick up and fall happily into from the opening where cazaril battered bruised and broken seeks no greater boon than a place as a scullion in the castle where once he served as a page the calm golden days he spends as tutor to iselle sister to the heir to the throne the frightening days in cardegos
5520,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,i read this in a marathon started at numpm read til numam and then all day today while i was getting a hair cut eating my leftover pasta for lunch walking down the street to get coffee so that gives an idea of the ability of ms bujold to suck you into her world and only spit you out exhausted and dizzy at the final page it is a first class fantasy world beautifully written with one of those amazing utterly unlikely bujold heroes cazaril marked as much by doggedness and decency as an
5521,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,a nice way to start off the new year the first book i finished in num turns out to be i think a perfect genre novel and it s not as easy to write one of those as you might think you have to give your readers some of the conventions of the genre because that s usually why they re reading it in the first place you also have to make it seem fresh not just a tired rehash of whatever came before this book has all the stuff you look for in a political intrigue type fantasy princesses dark ma
5523,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,this was quite a read the first quarter to third i found quite slow moving but then things really started to happen this is one of those books where things keep getting enjoyably worse until you re gulping the book down with no idea what s going to happen next things i liked the setting ahh this is a very medieval/renaissance spain inspired fantasy world which i thought was just the coolest thing and gave the world a very distinct feel to the stock standard northern european setting

5527,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,this one was really close to five stars really close there are just a few nitpicky things i can say that s wrong with it but first the good stuff the narrator lupe dy cazaril is flawed and tormented but still a good man he is very likeable and sympathetic and view spoiler [i love that he got a good ending in this book hide spoiler ] the setting and worldbuilding and religion building even were exceptionally well done i could see the geography of this fictional place in my mind as
5528,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,this first book in the world of five gods series is the first non vorkosigan book by bujold i have read unlike the vorkosigan books this one is strictly fantasy rather than science fiction as i had expected bujold does a great job with the world building in this and her characters are well developed i was intrigued by the quintarian religion they worship the father the mother the son the daughter and the bastard and by the roknari variant which omits the bastard in her sci fi epic

5535,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,wow what an audiobook this is the story of a talented courageous and honorable man who the vagaries of fate have made a failure at almost everything he attempted in his life he’s now tired both in body and soul and at the beginning he gives the impression of having been defeated so many times that he doesn’t have the strength to carry on but an unexpected opportunity with two giggling charges give cazaril the opportunity to continue fighting for both love and duty the narrative is tinged
5536,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,after a deceptively slow start the book picked up a lot around the num mark it went from leisurely to wildfire now that all is said and done i absolutely love this book no holds barred hands down pick another cliche it s a wonderful book that uses fantasy to re examine earth history in this case the story of ferdinand isabella and also ponder the mystery there s enough world history and metaphysics hiding beneath the folds of this story to make it three meals worth of delectab

5540,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,as posted on zezee with books i was hooked soon as i started reading and my curiosity about how things would be resolved and whether or not the gods are real kept me going when i later learned on tor com that each book in the series focuses on a different god i knew i must read them all there are three books in this series so far and i bought the other two immediately upon completing the curse of chalion the curse of chalion has a slow build up despite being hooked from early on my inter
5541,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,note the curse of chalion is the first of three books set in the same world an award winning sequel and a prequel but i ve read none of the others so chalion can be read as a standalone it s that self contained five gods it really is you my lord dy cazaril i bid you welcome to my house cazaril protagonist and sole numrd person narrator of the book has nowhere to go when he returns to the royacy of chalion once a page a courtier a captain castle warder and courier the intrig

5544,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,i haven’t read bujold for a while i’ve forgotten what a consummate master she is from the first page the story pulled me in every little detail is necessary prompting further development every turn in the road drives the plot forward the author builds her rich and complex world gradually without resorting to an info dump through the eyes and mind of her single pov character – cazaril widely educated gifted in literature and music warfare and diplomacy cazaril has been a top ranking o
5545,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,two readers i trust will duquette and amy h sturgis have strongly recommended both this author and book i certainly am glad they did although if goodreads allowed it i would give it num num/num stars instead of the full num simply because i feel the ending was rushed as if the author was ready to get this situation done and the book sent out i felt this especially in the case of the romantic resolution for the protagonist however overall i really enjoyed this tale of a bedraggled galley ship su
5546,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,i don t need to heap more accolades on this already beloved book which was actually published more recently than i originally thought but as i am widely known as the guy who hates everything take it from me that this book is well worth your time you can read a dozen synopses about the plot raves about the character of cazaril praise for the writing so i m not going to do that here suffice it to say those people are all correct one of the thngs that often bothers me about stories is their
5547,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,curse of chalon slow burn thoughtful and complex fantasy i don t have enough time these days to write a proper review certainly not a review sufficient to do justice to this quasi historical adult fantasy tale about a melancholy and broken older character dark magic and curses a feisty young heroine and a fascinating fantasy world loosely inspired by the historical drama of isabella i of castile and ferdinand ii of aragon who united spain in the numth century but with bujold s signature sk
5548,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,the world building is fascinating the main character was in danger of the too good to be true trope fortunately he was made human by his sufferings the first num/num exuded much weariness i can almost taste it the prose was lovely and painted images in my head ms bujold did not disappoint by the way like typical fantasy novels the book introduced me to plethora of characters with dramatic names and strange terms within the first dozens pages it was made worse by the very slow beginning
5549,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,3,i m giving this num stars because in the beginning and for quite some time ii was actually very interested and totally enjoying the story but then at a certain point i started to lose interest i ended up dropping it today after about an hour of listening when i realized how bored i was and i just didn t care what happened anymore in the story so i m onto other things now 
5550,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,this is an excellent fantasy novel by an author who excels in creating believable worlds with sympathetic and engaging characters highly recommended the religious aspects of this novel are particularly fascinating with gods and goddesses who intervene in the characters lives believably not as dei ex machina 
5551,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,the curse of chalion is good classic fantasy it’s intriguing but slow in pace and it’s the perfect book to pick up after an exhilarating page turner just finished reading a dark book and need something lighter this is your book curious about adult fantasy books but wary about violence/mature content this is your book hesitant about fantasy because it’s your least read genre this is your book bujold’s conservative and hopeful tone to her writing is something rarely seen in fantasy these d
5552,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,no spoilers book two of a series but can really be read as a standalone and the first book written in the series we find our main character caz downtrodden poor and broken journeying his way back to the castle where he served as a squire he is lucky enough to be recognized by the dowager of the castle and is taken in to become a tutor and becomes embroiled in their lives bujold creates a strong willed character in caz who is enjoyable to read 
5553,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,this was my first taste of lois mcmaster bujold and i will definitely be back for me while the magic was very understated and there were no fantastic creatures or races to mark this as a fantasy nonetheless it was a fantastic tale of dynastic misfortunes political machinations and self sacrificial secretaries cazaril was the embodiment of a humble intelligent man seeking respite from his wearing and near fatal travels we meet him on the road walking back to valendra fondly remembered from

5557,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,by thor and odin s magical bracers i loved this book given that i have a weakness for character driven stories this was hardly a surprise but i did go in with very high expectations and that normally means i set myself up to fail it is easier to like a steam punk shifter romance you expect nothing but a lot of brain bleach usage from than it is to like something you ve been considering reading for a very long time by one of your favourite authors bujold s vorkosigan series is solid and enjo
5558,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,3,the curse of the chalion is a fantasy novel set around historical events of spain due to that fact the book might remind people of ggk although their styles are very different overall the book was enjoyable thanks to a well written character the setting as well as excellent writing num plot the story is that of cazaril a lord who was sold off into slavery thanks to people who mean him harm in the court we see the world of medieval spain through his eyes as he joins as a tutor to iselle a ro

5560,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,despite the fact that this book was quite a long time on my tbr my expectations were quite high due to the excellent rating and reviews nevertheless i went into it without knowing what it’s going to be about except fantasy of course and thought that this would be a trilogy however this book stands very well on its own and currently i feel no need to read the other two books that take place in the same world but not time… still it was a very good and character driven story that follows a
5561,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,this was a great fantasy with very well rounded characterization cazaril is a man in need of solace scarred both mentally and physically and aged beyond his years he returns to the house of chalion where he served as a page in his youth he is then appointed secretary to the royess and her lady in waiting treachery politics and of course the curse of chalion all distrupt cazaril s solitude at times the pace is a tad too slow but the interesting characters kept me hanging on to the very
5562,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,i don t know whether it was my mood going into it or the book itself but i simply could not put this one down it s the first time in a while that i ve blown off so many of my miscellaneous obligations to spend a couple of daylight hours reading obviously i really enjoyed it the theology and depiction of sainthood within that were quite interesting as was the main character s gradual rise through the book there was a bit toward the end where i felt like it might be starting to drag a bit 
5563,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4, num num stars the book was slow to start but i m so so glad i pressed on the payoff in the end is almost on par with the count of monte cristo usually i m skeptical and annoyed by too much theology in my books but i thought the five gods was woven really well into the plot of this book even in the end when things got all metaphysical it made sense within the story although the protagonist is a man i was happy to see so many strong women in the story as well 
5565,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,i had almost forgotten just how much i adore this book i m glad i remembered my love for it enough to think to re read it or listen to it this time as the case may be

5567,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,i m really not sure how this book slipped past my radar but i am sad it took me so long to get it props to my friend who told me it would be exactly my jam my jam it definitely was this is a slow build character driven political fantasy of a type that i love if you need immediate action snark or a breakneck pace this won t be for you it s told entirely from the perspective of caz a physically broken ex soldier returning to the place he served as a boy to escape the attentions of
5568,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,a meticulously plotted witty and engrossing read that reminded me why i like fantasy so much each event and description has its place and relevance put together to create a flawlessly functioning story it s not a particularly challenging novel there s no great subverting of fantasy reader expectations no working class revolution but it does focus on goodness and kindness and decency rather than daring and war time heroism the novel achieves a good balance of focusing on story character
5569,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,there s just something about the combination of court intrigue meddling gods and witty banter that sings to my soul as a reader the curse of chalion contains all three it also contains women who know their own minds and make their own decisions and use their own resources to save themselves something of which i ll always approve i think caz the protagonist may be one of my all time favorite characters 
5570,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,i was pretty distracted and nervous a few days ago and feeling somewhat down so i wanted a comfort reread but i had already reread all the elantra books by michelle sagara west recently i didn t want to read a paper book either because i can t change the font size when my eyes act up or get tired so i took out my recent e purchase of one of my favourite bujold fantasies there was a sale or a coupon or something i ve just finished it and it really feels like it redirected my spirit and refre

5572,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,bujold needs num chapters to bring the world and the characters with all it s names and themes to the reader only then she allows the novel to take up high speed i tagged it as a historical fiction because it takes up numth century mediaeval spain or more exactly the kingdom of castile and león and tells the tale of how isabella of castile got to marry ferdinand of aragon and all of their relatives but it is more a fantasy novel the historical characters are named differently set in a d
5573,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,i loved this book so much what a great way to start out a new year of books this world the author created is fully realized from religion awesome to politics to geography although there is no map but i can still visualize one in my head from her descriptions to language it was such a joy to be immersed in this world the story is a slow burn for sure it picks up a little when they get to the capital but even then some might find the plot lacking that however would be a mistake th

5577,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,this was an easy story for me to be drawn into character driven — and how lupe dy cazaril is not your typical fantasy hero he is a man damaged betrayed and afraid this of course begs the question how on earth is he going to accomplish his heroics the use of demons and gods is complex and intriguing providing a unique religious presence that — while a significant aspect of the story — is not preachy bujold handled it neatly showing the entirely human tendency to wander back and fort
5578,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,i am in love with bujold after reading only two of her many books the quality of her writing is leaps and bounds ahead of the rest of the genre masterly world building magical systems weapons and armor adventurous journeys soaring ramparts gods and demons love in bloom bujold has it all and can turn a delectable phrase that said her characters would much sooner talk their way out of a fight or skewer their opponents with words this is a blessing and at the same time a curse you see

5581,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,this is one of the best works of fantasy i have read recently the book starts with the hero lupe dy cazaril on the road making his way to valanda the closest place he has got to a home he is not the typical fantasy hero young and just coming of age and entering the world for the first time he is rather a middle aged and broken down man who has already seen and experienced a lot what follows is a wonderful building of cazaril’s character and his journey all the major and minor characters in
5582,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,in the last couple of months i have read all of bujold s vorkosigan saga i am not sure what i expected in this totally different book/series fantasy not sci fi to begin with otherwise i had no idea but it is awesome the main character is multi faceted and interesting and the story is told from his sometimes troubled and confused viewpoint which changes over time as he learns more about what is really going on once again i am enthralled by bujold s creativity and her gift with the writte
5584,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,this is a epic fantasy the characters are well defined the plot is rich and the story has a great mix of adventure magic and romance my only drawback is the names of the characters it s like the author threw the alphabet into a hat a and just used whatever she pulled out in whatever order they came in luckily the narrator lloyd james read it on the audio i listened to and he pronounced them he has the voice of a natural story teller and really brought the characters to life 
5585,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,oh my gosh this was so good on reddit this book was described as really comforting and having finished it i know what they meant i just really enjoyed it the magic made sense and was consistent there was quite a lot of political action but it was all really easy to understand pacing could be a little uneven but still very enjoyable
5586,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,i m doing something i never do rounding up this book is a solid num num stars but i m rounding up because there s just something about it that i can t really pin point that i loved so much i loved cazaril he was a great flawed character and the writing style was eloquent and flowing i listened to this on audio and need to give the narrator a round of applause overall good read 
5587,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,3,num num solid book loved the characters setting and dialog think this fell victim to expectations that were too high due to reading prior reviews loved cazriel wish there had been more around the gods etc didn t feel as much of a fantasy as it did a political drama

5593,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,“if you lent me a razor now for me to cut my throat with it would save ever so many steps ” feared they weren’t writing fantasy like this anymore excellent in every way good world and cosmology building deep first person point of view maybe romance a map humor a satisfying ending what more could a reader want more well there’s that too bujold is a master “his heart melted or maybe it was his wits ” unique among current fantasy because this world has several fully developed religion
5594,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,finally i ve been venturing out trying out new fantasy authors and finally finally i came across one i love i really like bujold s writing nothing about it that rubs me as contrived and fake she crafted wonderful characters within an engaging story that didn t seem cliche whatsoever i am a sucker for a quality likable protagonist mysteries surprises and happy endings all of which i got in this book

5597,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,this book is a slow burn but the protagonist is one of the best protagonists i have encountered in num years of fantasy stories and getting to know and understand him is well worth it num num stars 
5598,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,a unique world with a peculiar interaction between humans and gods a unique story and a unique mc who proved to be a very reluctant hero i did expect some of the twists but that did not detract from my overall enjoyment a bit more action and a bit less intrigue would have made it even better but still it was well worth reading 
5599,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,num num out of num stars the curse of chalion is beautifully written high fantasy novel with court intrigue an interesting religious structure and a varied cast of likable characters the story follows a former castillar named cazaril who attempts to put his life back together after being wronged by a rival cazaril is incredibly easy to root for and his story arc is very satisfying this book has done a nice job of filling the robin hobb less void in my life and i look forward to reading the other no
5600,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,first posted at fantasy review barn another example of me finding a book that it feels everyone else already knew about raved about and left me wondering why the hell i have not read it before ‘the curse of chalion’ is my first reading of bujold but will certainly not be my last here is an author who knows how to play with pacing keeping the duller times in the character’s lives interesting somehow but providing occasional action scenes that don’t lack either even better in my mind the v
5601,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,num/num i have read nearly all of lois mcmaster bujold s science fiction vorkosigan saga and found them fun to read but not light in terms of characters and themes this the first of the fantasy chalion trilogy is similar impressive in plotting and characterization yet so readable that the pages flew by my only complaint is the lack of a map 
5602,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,the first of the five gods series this is a re read – or a re listen because this time it s the audio book bujold is my favourite author and of all her books this is my favourite so this is a five star review before i even start i wasn t sure i liked lloyd james narration to start off with but it quickly grew on me cazaril once courtier courier/spy captain and castle warder now a homeless hungry and ragged refugee is walking from ibra across chalion to valenda home of the doawager pr
5603,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,i can t believe i never read this one until now it s so good caz is a woobie the good end well and the bad end badly and the scene where the wrath from high atop the thing does in fact strike was deeply satisfying and i loved the young noblewomen and how smart they were and how believable it was that iselle would end up as a very powerful leader the magical/religious system was pretty great too 
5604,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,this book is one of my all time favourites i re read or more usually re listen to it several times a year cazaril is not your usual fantasy protagonist he isn t the clean cut heroic type he s in his middle thirties and pretty much everything in his life has turned out to be a disaster the book opens with him standing in the road dressed like a beggar having walked several hundred miles to get home after nearly two years as a galley slave this is a man who has hit rock bottom he s wo
5605,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,overall a little slow to start but oh so worth hanging in there what a beautiful well written story num stars the good stuff num this is a character driven story and one of the best i ve ever encountered told entirely from the perspective of lupe dy cazaril it takes us along on his journey from a broken man to well i can t really say without ruining the book for you while there s plenty going on much of the story takes place inside his mind i know that sounds boring as all get out but
5606,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,3,this book came highly recommended so maybe it s inevitable that i was disappointed as far as fantasy goes it s somewhat above average but still didn t really do it for me the curse of chalion follows its nontraditional hero cazaril a man in his mid thirties who s failed at most of his endeavors and is recovering from a stint as a galley slave as he becomes tutor to the princess iselle and helps her navigate the waters of a treacherous court the story is driven more by character than pl
5607,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,the curse of chalion i love this book i love this series and i generally love everything that bujold writes but curse of chalion is one of my very favorite books period i love cazaril and his general long suffering conviction that he s going to die so he might as well get as much stuff done as possible before he kicks it i love iselle and her bloody minded stubbornness and strength i love betriz s cleverness and kindness and compassion and similar bloody minded stubbornness everything ab
5608,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,2,in my opinion this isn t a fantasy it s a very slow single character driven political thriller approximately num parts politics num parts theology i don t mind slow pacing so long as it s deliberate and eventually pays off instead there are long passages with people sitting there recounting what just happened for the forth time or maybe i just haven t read enough jane austin to appreciate this sort of realism still not knowing that the pay off wasn t going to come about i did feel c
5609,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,3,i think i may be in the minority with this book it was very eh for me bujold is one hell of a writer don t get me wrong and the story was interesting but amazingly predictable the ending was disappointing cliche to the point of being nauseating the characters were very black and white i think the problem might be with me rather than the actual book i just don t think this is really where my reading interests lie i m not a fan of black and white situations and characters i don t en
5610,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,num num well written and thought provoking 
5611,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,i was pleasantly surprised to find a fantasy novel by bujold as the book selection for august num in the sword laser book club i ve always thought of her as a sf writer so i approached this with some skepticism but i ended up enjoying it quite a bit the story is about another cripple possibly inspired by tyrion lannister and certainly informed by miles vorkosigan dy cazaril grew up as a noble page then distinguished himself with honor as a soldier for years before he was mistaken
5612,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,3,mmmmm dreamy savouring coc is like sweet homecoming nestling in a security blanket with a hot cocoa and kleenex and being lulled with the promise of a safe and steady steer through chartered waters to the inevitable happily ever after a fantasy only in as much as names of places are make belief and a coterie of undefined but ebullient gods seem to be popping up straight from the annals of greek mythology but discretely and background fillerish this good old fashioned historical adventure
5613,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,a very refreshing read entertaining to the end i say refreshing because the plot of almost all fantasy i ve read develops in a anglo saxon kind of setting while the curse of chalion takes place in more of an alternate reality medieval spain being myself a tropical man i yearn for a tropical native author of fantasy who would venture to bring their characters to life within the landscapes of the tropics all of the fantasy books i ve read center heavily on the passing of seasons for us
5614,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,golly i don t even like high fantasy much and i m entranced bujold is just that good she paints these remarkably sympathetic characters who somehow manage not to be flat or simple or too idealized anyways cazaril is really charmingly humble about his heroism gah maybe the first adult male character i ve actually admired in literature in months the last one might have been miles vorkosigan and the ladies aren t subject to endless shallow adulation but written as developed people with qu
5615,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,the strength of this story is in is characters who are incredibly well fleshed out strikingly human very believable and more often than not quite likeable also a huge plus are that despite a standard patriarchal fantasy world the novel contains a number of intelligent active well portrayed female characters who exist and work of their own right rather than acting as props or foils for the male characters the story itself is interesting and has good momentum and a few interesting twists 
5616,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,dammit i hadn t planned on this but now i ll have to read the rest of the books in this series and bujold continues to give me at least one passage in each book to laugh out loud at men write poems to the objects of our desire in order to lure them closer how practical in that case you d think men would write more poems to ladies private parts the ladies would hit us lips are a safe compromise being as it were a stand in or stepping stone to the greater mysteries hah anyway i des
5617,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,i don t think i will be able to adequately descibe quite how good the curse of chalion is because it is so very complex and detailed and so well completely excellent it has a hero who is more in the anti hero mold someone who starts out at the beginning of the story as a broken man and who stays broken in one way or another right the way through the story whilst effecting change in a quiet subtle and self effacing way the characterisation of caz is quite quite brilliant he rates with mile
5618,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,a venture into fantasy for her starting with cazaril a worn man all but creeping along the road to a place where he thought he might find refuge after a disatrous campaign he had been sold as a galley slave and freed only by a chance capture by another navy at the castle the provincara remembers him from when he was a page there her daughter the dowager queen is there with her two children the half siblings of the king the terms are all invented they work smoothly though in
5619,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,2,goodreads tells me i read this in may num i did not remember a word of it it was an entirely new experience for me this time around i don’t have too much to say now either i think this is competently written though at times the writing style is inconsistent and doesn’t seem to flow with the rest of the narrative i think the characters themselves have compelling moments but mostly i think i’ve read about thirty other books set in this same world and i’m dinging this book for that how
5620,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,list of complaints i ve read about this book slow pacing maybe if you re used to fast action/thriller type stories i d agree for the first quarter of the book but i d compare it to a relaxing sunday afternoon stroll one dimensional characters by this i mean very clear cut good vs evil no shades of gray i would agree with this statement it seems to belong in the old school of fantasy and this didn t bother me at all too predictable i guess i can see that but come on what s wrong with a happ
5621,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,num num a slow really slow start but a really good second half of the book i really enjoyed it and will continue on with the series cazaril returns to the household in which he once served as a page now though he isn t a boy but a man that has been through dangerous situations that took everything from him he is named secretary to the sister of the heir to the throne this new role will lead him to the court of cardegoss where old enemies and intrigues are threatening him and iselle i admi
5622,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,boy can this woman write this is a wonderful fantasy story about a broken man cazaril recovering himself the story of our hero and what has happened to him enfolds slowly and more and more the reader begins to empathize and understand just who cazaril is i would say that this is a very spiritual read about guilt and redemption about courage and sacrifice and putting the right thing to do over one s own interests i loved it and wished i had written it it won the mythopoeic fantasy awar
5623,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,a rare fantasy book that is a real book not a set up for the next num books like all of lois mcmaster bujold s books this is character driven with like able but imperfect characters and the political observations are spot on the religious culture is well thought out and interesting and the relationships and conversations are all possible and believable in the context one of the reasons i love nearly all her books is that i never feel like yelling at the main characters telling them that t
5624,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,well this book is a bit pedestrian i thought as it slowly meandered along but i could not put it down was totally irritated when i had to put it down to eat stayed up much later than usual because i had to finish it unlike the other two series the sharing knife and miles vorkosigan the pov stays the same in this story good thing too as there is a lot to experience observe and absorb in spite of the build up and reader preparation i was totally blown away by the climax i am also v
5625,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,rereading shards of honour recently i re found a statement that so perfectly describes why i love bujold s books cordelia replying to the wily emperor ezar says that she and aral are both pursuing the same thing though by different names honor or the grace of god and this book feels like an achingly perfect example of that pursuit no matter how many times i read it 
5626,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,as usual her writing is superior her main character isn t perfect he has flaws but not flaws that make you dislike him her religion is fascinating and her world is interesting rather than borrowing from real life she creates her own titles royse for prince royesse for princess etc her story is gripping and you aren t sure of the outcome until very near the end the main character is likeable as are the supporting characters the villain is despicable and very easy to hate typica
5627,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,in many ways this book is a departure from standard fantasy fare all of the tropes are there swords castles kingdoms in peril magic and yet this reads as much like a serious exploration of numth century court conspiracies as it does a rip roaring fantasy adventure although perhaps a bit slower than optimal and although its protagonist comes across as a little too self effacing at times there s really not much to complain about here the plot is well thought out the language precise 
5628,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,while this book took me some time to get into i found myself slowly being drawn into the complicated and intriguing story that it became the world was well developed and i really came to trust and care for cazaril with plenty of twists and turns and what was that moments and many rereadings of pages i couldn t wait to see what was going to happen next i enjoyed the thoroughness and care that the author took when writing this story and look forward to reading more from her 
5629,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,i think i enjoyed this even more the second time around this author has such a great talent for writing interesting flawed but sympathetic characters and i enjoyed following cazaril on his journey through the book a must for fans of high fantasy 
5630,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,this is on my short list of favoured books of all time when the souls rise up in glory yours shall not be shunned nor sundered but shall be the prize of the gods gardens even your darkness shall be treasured then and all your pain made holy 
5631,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,i already was pretty sure i would like this from the reviews apparently i have a thing for decent heroes and i thought the religious concept fascinating i loved following this story of a terrible curse and the people who fight it to its dramatic and satisfying conclusion 
5632,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,1,i managed to read seven chapters of this book but the author focused enough on the num year old protagonist being aroused by the num and num year old girls that he’s tutoring well i had to put it down if that’s something that squicks you avoid this book 
5633,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,num num stars a really fantastic work of fantasy gods meddling in mortal lives political intrigue quite a bit of darkness all of which i m a huge fan lloyd james was amazing as the soft spoken caz and this was a wonderful audio production overall 
5634,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,this is like the polar opposite to a song of fire and ice—the bad guys get what s coming to them the good triumph and the gods smile down upon the world a very interesting take on theology and court politics

5643,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,i had never read any lois mcmaster bujold before and would not have selected this book to read from its description or cover if it had not been for the sword laser book club which selected it as this month s pick as a sword or fantasy selection the whole reason i decided to try and follow this club was that i was stuck in a rut of the same old classic sci fi fantasy authors and there were so many genre authors out but so many seemed to be well trash i wanted to find a clu
5644,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,i don t want to just repeat all the gushing reviews about this book that have already been written and i generally agree with them so i ll just talk about an aspect that fascinated me – the religion the worship of the five gods is central the story and i find religions and their sociological impacts interesting the people of chalion are known as quinterians and they worship a set of five deities styled the father mother daughter and son each linked with a season traditional colors a st
5645,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,the curse of chalion introduces readers to a man who once held a reputation for being a good soldier and trustworthy commander but who has crossed the wrong people and now mainly wants to live a quiet life   the gods however seem to have other plans and soon cazaril is thrust into the dangerous court intrigue he so desired to avoid as well as an epic battle to save his country from a curse few even know lie over it i wasn’t entirely sure what to expect when i began reading this novel and i
5646,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,this book is just great and just a pleasure to read even when it moves into real darkness a man returns from war and slavery to beg for a position from someone who once knew him as a boy the novel begins so simply and yet the heights it reaches feels more and more inevitable as it goes on there are villains but few heroes and even the villains are mostly put there by circumstance and godly indifference a curse plagues a nation and our cowardly protagonist cazaril must break it it all fee
5647,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,i picked this one up on a whim because i kept hearing good things about it that weren t specific enough to entice me to read it for this reason i decided to start it while i was having a weak moment because it was doubtful i d ever pick it up otherwise i m glad i did the book is astoundingly sedate relying almost entirely upon court intrigue and a masterfully unwinding mystery of divine intervention for its forward momentum it s also entirely plot based by clever design as i mentioned t
5648,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,upe dy cazaril has gone through what anyone else might consider a month s worth of their worst days ever captured in battle and somehow left off the ransom list he winds up the oarsman on a slaver ship getting treated as well as most slaves get treated i e terribly before fate intervenes and gets him washed ashore with only the clothes on his back no money a broken body and his slowly recovering wits any one of which is a step up from where he was before with nowhere else to go he walk
5649,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,a sophisticated and complex book for any genre despite sounding and sometimes looking like a run of the mill high fantasy tome the curse of chalion is an exploration of faith as much as it s a page turning adventure set in the fictional country of chalion in a vaguely medieval setting the story centers around cazaril a castilliar of the realm something like a lord who has recently returned to what is left of his home after being sold onto a slave ship he enters into the service of h
5650,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,spending a lazy day in bed after my first full night shift today seems like the perfect time to finally do the proper review of this book that i promised in my first short reaction a few weeks ago the essence of that first reaction for the record was that num this book belongs to a subgenre – medieval fantasy – that i m not too fond of yet i ended up loving it a lot and num it made me cry twice which is highly unusual the curse of chalion on my first read left me with a strong impre
5651,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,3,what are you looking for in a fantasy novel things this book does well num create likeable characters num have a plot that is not a lotr or hp clone it s more like a junior version of a game of thrones num create a fleshed out world built on an interesting set of fictional deities i appreciate that the deities do not feel like fictionalized versions of real deities from world history i like that their presence is felt indirectly by the characters and the characters have to infer the whys and w
5652,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,i enjoyed the dickens out of this novel i thought this was post game of thrones high fantasy but looking at the publication date i guess it wasn t really after the books sure but certainly not after the phenomenon of the show so i suppose the overlap is coincidence or i don t really know anyway i do like this new brand of politically aware low magic fantasy this is a take on got fantasy that s more i don t like to say more feminine but certainly more concerned with women and women s i
5654,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,what a book stellar writing the thing that i love most about the book is that even though it s secondary world fantasy even though its epic fantasy the stakes aren t the world the stakes are a single family a single kingdom and you don t even find out those are the stakes until half way through the book but it remains interesting because every character has a history every character has a story and bubbling underneath the surface is a deep theological debate which you can choose to study
5655,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,i finished this last week but it s taken me a while to write a review as i wasn t sure how i wanted to rate it initially i thought it was a solid num star but then i got to the ending and that was pretty awesome so then i was thinking num star but then i remember that for a lot of it i was hovering around num so i settled at a num num star and rounded up hence my num star rating for me the beginning started out a bit slower than i m used to and i think that for once i had the audio version on too fas
5656,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,this num novel by lois mcmaster bujold won the mythopoeic fantasy award for adult literature i read much more science fiction than fantasy so this was definitely outside my usual box the first thing that struck me about it was how much i liked the characters especially cazaril the broken former soldier who stumbles into valenda looking for any kind of work and how carefully the characters are built in the first half of the book it is not until halfway through that anything at all fantas
5657,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,i m rounding up in appreciation of bujold s feat in dreaming up yet another terrific series fully distinct from the two previous series i ve so enjoyed the vorkosigan saga and the sharing knife i believe i would at least try any genre bujold ventured into even horror or porn i ve never before read a book whose worldbuilding included a new and apparently valid religion that s an ambitious task but bujold pulls it off along with the society in which the five gods are worshipped with a
5658,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,listening to lloyd james s audiobook was a delight i really appreciated the individuality of the voices especially the small touches like the page with the voice that cracks the story itself was a lot of fun i enjoyed the world building the independence of the main female characters and a lot of the little things like betriz being the initiator of most of the relationship with caz i did have some issues with the pacing particularly when i got num of the way through and realized that the
5659,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,richly imagined and immensely rewarding this fantasy is everything you want a fantasy to be detailed fast paced with a convincing world and depth of imagination and most rarely vivid characters who leap off the page there aren t enough ways to rave about bujold s work here i binged it in a day 
5661,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,more booklove 😍😍😍 seriously this year has been filled with excellent reads i should never write reviews right after finishing a book because i m at my most adoring and least impartial but i really adored both this book and paladin of souls the interactions of the characters with their religion gods is one of my favorite parts i think though i love the plot characters as well 
5662,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,finally getting back to this series i like the way bujold examines religion in this series eager to get on to the others the narrator took a little bit of getting used to but he ended up working for me 
5663,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,bujold for the win once again it kept me constantly reaching for the book in every free moment captivating and interesting i will try to find rest of the books from the series as i really enjoyed this one 
5664,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,3,there s a lot to like about the book the characters are very well done and kept me interested but there was also a lot going on in this book and i confess not all of it interested me personally going to continue on with the series though 
5665,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,i don t read a ton of high fantasy but my feelings on this were that the medieval intrigue was good but it could have used a wizard or an ogre or something good vacation reading though 
5666,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,3,very shallow characters black and white ending is predictable how magic in this world works is not good enough described so events are pretty much deus ex machina 
5667,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,read it at the beach bonus 
5669,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,a tale of fantasy politics bravery and faith the num pages start a little slow but end by taking the reader in their grip

5674,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,well crafted i was a little hesitant to start slogging through a big book at the end of vacation but any slogging ended by page num or num bujold can turn a phrase just right to infuse it with a delightful gentle humor she s also good at deep theological discussion nestled in very interesting dialogue reminded me of brandon sanderson s mistborn series or tamora pierce s song of the lioness 
5675,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,5,romance and intrigue characters and worlds are so beautifully drawn i never tire of this author she also knows how to use the language which is both a joy and a relief my only complaint is that i’d like each book to be a num book series 
5676,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,2,i love lois mcmaster bujold i love miles vorkosigan and her remarkable space operas i don t feel at all the same about this supposedly i read this last year but i don t remember finishing it then this then will be my second and last attempt to enjoy this series from an author i adore 
5677,The Curse of Chalion,Lois McMaster Bujold,4,nominated for a world fantasy award in num the curse of chalion marked a shift for bujold from the sci fi adventure of miles vorkosigan to a more sedately paced fantasy novel as commander of a border garrison castillar lupe de cazaril held the fort against the enemy for longer then anyone expected peaceful negotiations prevailed and the fort was sold to the enemy unfortunately for caz he was “mistakenly” left off the list of ransomed men and quickly sold into slavery on rocknari galley retu
5678,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,honestly what made me want to read this book was the movie gasp i know i know shouldn t do that the movie was good i am a fan of hayo miyazaki s films and i wasn t disappointed in the book as always much of the book wasn t put into the movie but it was understandable because i imagine it would be hard to piece together a movie with all the components this story has to really grasp and understand the book i would suggest that it be read twice i think since i did watch the movie i wasn t

5684,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,4,howl s moving castle for whatever reason failed to engage me the first time i read it several years ago but it worked much better the second time around i really felt for sophie the main character who feels so timid trapped and hopeless that when she s unfairly hit with a curse that turns her from a young woman into an old crone it actually frees her in more ways than one she leaves her dead end job in the village and for lack of a better option moves herself without bothering to a

5711,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,i feel like i ve done myself a disservice by having watched the miyazaki film dozens of times before reading the novel but not too much of a disservice there are so many beautiful scenes from the movie full of magic flight and war that didn t exist in the novel who knew apparently everyone and yet i can t fault the novel for not being great because it was step by step all of the characters were pretty damn spot on with what i know of the film except i was given a great gift of

5715,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,4,this was a charming story i ve never read diana wynne jones before and enjoyed it quite a bit it reminded me a lot of neil gaiman s stardust although i did not like that one nearly as much the character of sophie hatter was well done i liked her wit and her take no prisioners attitude the supporting case was also good i particularly liked calcifier and his interactions with sophie as to howl himself there was no doubt in my mind his true self and i knew from the start where the tal

5728,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,2,after a good initial start this story never took off the way i anticipated and hoped it might the writing style was difficult for me to get caught up in and i kept waiting for something enchanting and thrilling to happen unfortunately after chapter num nothing did at all while i appreciated some aspects of wynne jones fantasy building the castle and it s doorway portals in particular i don t see where she executed these ideas in any kind of sustained imaginative way apart from howl w
5730,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,3,this was a very fun charming story it really seems so simply written yet read more than one line and you are a part of the action not just watching it i really enjoyed sophie and feel like she is very human prone to snap judgments and bad decisions and she tends to underestimate herself howl is a very fun character a bit of a player until his heart is stolen literally i would like to check out the other books in the series but this one does stand alone quite nicely 
5731,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,it s been a long while since i read this but i remembered absolutely loving it my memories were correct in fact i read every book by diana wynne jones i could get my hands on growing up i ve finally gotten a chance to reread this and i m glad i choose the audiobook format jenny sterlin was brilliant she utilizes her voice distinctly for the varied characters she even makes a distinction between old sophie and new sophie very well i recommend listening to the audio if you have a chance 
5732,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,to start off i am a huge fan of hayao miyazaki s animated version of howl s moving castle based off this book i even have howl calcifer and the moving castle as part of my studio ghibli sleeve i couldn t help but compare the book and movie though bc i have seen the movie so many times i have it memorized for a long time i didn t know that the animated movie was based on a book and then i recently had the chance to pick it up and read it from my library i adored this book the movie incons

5736,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,4,at least no one can accuse me of not having read this book now howl s moving castle is probably the single most popular piece of children s fantasy right after harry potter of course i ve heard endless praise for this series ever since it was first released but for some reason or the other i was never drawn to it it seemed charming but not much else well as i expected jones s story is a charming cute and fun adventure novel with just the right amount of depth to be considered prevale
5737,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,4,“things are going round and round in my head or maybe my head is going round and round in things ” what a cute and whimsical story i d only heard of it but i d never read it before or seen the movie i guess it is about time 
5739,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,i don’t know how many times i’ve read this now but it’s probably my favourite of diana wynne jones’ work i actually saw the studio ghibli adaptation first it’s very different in some ways but it still captures some of the ideas and tone the thing i really loved though coming to the book after the film was discovering all the welsh background the ‘saucepan song’ howl’s family his welsh rugby shirt even some of the things he says — “there’s a welcome in the valleys” as well as the wel
5740,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,3,i couldn t tell you if i m giving this four stars because of hayao miyazaki or because the way the author writes about cream cakes is really satisfying but i did almost squeal when i found out this was a trilogy so that s gotta count for something right edit num num num so i took away a star because i m a horrible person but really i feel i was way too pumped up on miyazaki so my four stars was actually for that bacon and egg scene in the movie and because calcifer was voiced by billy cry
5741,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,i think one of the main thing’s i love about diana wynne jones’ novels is their ability to tell somewhat simplistic stories whilst integrating complex labyrinthine plots involving fantasy and magic while being tinged with grains of realism without losing that feel of being in a whole other world while i have read many books that are considered fantasy and have integrated realism into them i have discovered that most of these books are often mediocre the same goes for books who are considered
5743,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,4,i m rating this book num stars partially in sympathy for poor sophie with whom i identified intimately and partially because i feel like my otherwise lower rating would be due to my unfamiliarity with the fantasy genre i picked this book up on a whim from the discount bin in my local used bookstore i loved the hayao miyazaki movie but was mostly confused by it because of its visuals still the fantasy genre is one that hasn t been kind to me so in the first chapter when i found myself b
5744,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,i watched the movie first in fact it was entirely accidentally that my cousin and i in the midst of this loud busy family reunion came across the movie version and were completely sucked into the tale of sophie howl and calcifier so when the movie was done and i sat back with a sigh and some sadness that another good thing had come to an end i thought of reading the book to prolong the loveliness because everyone knows that books are always better right in this case the book was just
5746,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,this is a great story full of wit and charm and adventure it s a fantasy tale about sophie who is turned into an old woman by the witch of the waste leaving her family s hat shop behind she heads into the hills where wizard howl s moving castle has been wandering for a few weeks she finds a way into the castle despite the stories that howl eats young girl s hearts she s no longer young and so no longer afraid howl is young and incredibly vain he spends two hours in the bathroom befo
5747,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,the num anime by miyazaki brought me here i simply adore this film and wanted to get down to the nitty gritty of how it all came about i wouldn t say that the book is better than the film but i ll say this i had so much fun reading this book for the first time that i reread it right after finishing it which should tell you all you need to know olivier delaye author of the sebasten of atlantis series
5748,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,3, in the land of ingary where such things as seven league boots and cloaks of invisibility really exist it is quite a misfortune to be born the eldest of three until recently the only howl’s moving castle story i knew was that of the studio ghibli film of the same name unaware that the animated movie was in fact based on diana wynne jones novel curious of how the narrative would do on paper i was looking forward to reading this the story is about a young girl named sophie hatter eldes
5750,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,this has been one of my favorite books since the first time i read it wynne jones manages to make fun of every fairy tale cliche while gifting us with a world and a story that feels so fresh and yet so old because it s full of meaning and wonder a world we get to see as sophie hatter moves through it sophie the oldest daughter of a hat store owner and as such the one with no chance for an adventurous life is put under a spell by the powerful witch of the waste and has to leave the comfort

5752,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,4,don t read this book if you re expecting it to be like the movie i think the movie is very loosely based off of the book these characters are much more raw and wicked that the movie but they are just as amazing they bicker and fight all the time it s hilarious you ll still fall in love with howl there isn t any romance between the him sophie until the last pages so don t be on the look out for that he s always courting someone that isnt sophie and when he is with sophie he can t s

5786,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,4,last week i finally watched the anime version of this book this is a book that i had read long ago around the ages of twelve to fourteen and enjoyed very much at the time like the anime film my first venture into studio ghibli films it was a strange and wonderful adventure like all the best fantasy novels of my childhood the plot should be familiar to anyone who was seen the film or read any type of fairytale it features a witch cursing a young woman sophie transforming her into an elderl
5789,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,this brilliant and dazzling fantasy novel was the inspiration for the anime studio ghibli film by the same name howl s moving castle has everything from sorcery to friendship to adventure to imaginary kingdoms when the main character finds herself under a spell that turns her into an old woman the only thing she can think of is having the dreadful magic reversed she soon finds though that appearances aren t everything and that her newfound friends are more important to her than she initially

5794,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,4,i fell in love with the anime movie adaptation and still like it much better than the book but that isn’t to say the book isn’t entirely special in its own right and i think if i had read the book first i probably would have liked it even more it’s funny and swift with tremendously flawed characters who somehow still dance that line of utter likability didn’t really go for howl coming from wales but otherwise the fantasy world and magic system is quirky and delightful 
5795,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,2,this didn’t wow me like i expected it to and compared to my friends and many other people’s adoration it’s obvious that in this instance it’s a situation that clearly says “it’s me not you” overall this is for readers who are nostalgic for fairy tales that are full of mischief and magic curses and conquering evil and fulfilling one’s destiny best wishes that you enjoy it more than i did 
5796,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,4,well that was magicly adorable d i have a very strong ghibli vibe with this book because of the movie ive seen it years ago and i cant wait to rewatch it soon cute characters sometimes dragged for me but still it had its magic loved how it played out

5804,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,this is probably one of diana wynne jones best books in my opinion and i love it up there with dogsbody floating castles talking fires bouncing scarecrows they could only be the wonderful creations of dwj i think what the author does best is create very real and very identifiable characters that somehow you always feel you have always known it s sort of magical how she does it because many books may spend a few chapters establishing characters with dwj they just pop out at you straight

5821,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,4,this is lighthearted and just lots of fun the author said she got the idea from a boy at a school she was visiting who asked her to write about a moving castle in addition to the constant moving and rotating the castle boasts a color coded doorknob by turning the knob to a different color before you open the door you step out in a different location traveling made easy but of course all is not sweetness and light there s the wicked witch of the waste who puts a spell on sophie making
5824,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,4,diana wynne jones has always been the master of quirky unique fantasy and i ve found the best of these especially the chrestomanci books which i adore include travel between worlds this is no exception my only dislikes are that at some points it becomes a little confusing and also the fact that i waited so long to read it 
5825,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,having watched miyazaki s film before reading this and finding it a masterpiece of beauty and complex story i am truly surprised to find i enjoyed the novel just as much i thought i would feel miyazaki expanded on the story but the novel and the movie function as companions and stand alone well

5827,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,4,re read review rating num num/num i ve never properly finished a re read before but it was as delightful if not as enjoyable as the first time one thing that stood out to me during this re read was that the book started off with a pretty simple and solid plot but got a bit messy after more plot points were introduced i don t feel like they made the story stronger either and wish a bit more time was spent with the last few chapters in terms of sophie and howl i think that s one thing the film did
5828,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,ɴᴏʙᴏᴅɪᴇs sᴀғᴇ ɪɴ ᴀ ᴡɪᴢᴀʀᴅ s ʜᴏᴜsᴇ ♥ minor spoilers i honestly had the hardest time with this movie everyone kept telling me i had to watch it and that it was the greatest ghibi movie but once i did i found that it was my least favorite not that the book has particularly changed it s standing film wise but the book was a million times better i m literally so happy that i got around to reading this the movie poked so many holes into the plot and really down played howl s character and mad
5831,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,this is definitely one of those books that i enjoy more and more every time i read it i always have a memory of how rushed the ending is and i still think it’s pretty rushed but i think i understood the book quite a bit more this time the book builds to a climax but the actual final battle barely seems to take up many pages and then we have a few pages to wrap up all the plots via the narrator pointing out various things the audience didn’t know yet the complexity of jones’s writing is on
5832,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,let me get this out the way first this book is fricking awesome omg i have no words to convey how much i loved it this is the first book in a long time where i actually didn t check how long the length of each chapters were and i was actually so engrossed in the story that i kept reading on and on and didn t want to stop to tell you how bad it got my friend sent me a text asking me to hang out and my first thought was noooo i want to finish howl s moving castle yes it s that good pe
5833,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,3,it was okay not great i watched the movie for the first time about a year ago and don t remember a ton so i wasn t comparing the book to the movie as i read thankfully my main issue with it is that it wasn t terribly immersive the characters just flitted about from one problem/event to the next and it all seemed random and unimportant i do remember that my impression of the movie was that it lacked a cohesive plot and i found the same with the book i found myself frequently having to re
5835,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,after checking out the other editions of this book i ve discovered that my volume has either the second or the third ugliest cover out there well no matter don t judge a book by the dude on the cover and all that sophie lives in a fairy tale world that s very exciting for us readers of course but possibly less exciting for people like herself who have a stepmother two younger sisters and a tendency to say the wrong thing to evil witches the last unfortunate tendency alas gets her cu
5836,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,one of my favorite books of all time i am not really rational about it what i love sophie s crotchety behavior and her handiness with weedkiller howl s vanity which keeps him from being a fairy tale hero and makes him a gazillion times more interesting than one the clever twists on fairy tale tropes everything about calcifer and of course the green slime the ending is perfect despite coming together in quite a rush and the entire plot has an admirable crazy logic side note the boo
5837,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,4,i had seen the movie version of this many many years ago and wow this could not be more different they definitely both have merit but i have to say that i think the book is much more complicated and the characters are more nuanced i really love her writing style because she takes all of these very fantastical elements but writes about them in such a matter of fact way that you re sitting there like oh well obviously it reminds me a lot of neil gaiman so i think that people who enjoy his boo
5838,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,5,this was delightful i don t know why it took me so long to read it considering that i m a huge miyazaki fan and i ve refused to watch this movie because i had yet to read the book i found the story quite original even when it had subtle references to other fairy tales and children s books i loved the characters the setting well i loved it 
5839,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,4,fantastic utterly fun entertaining and magical such a fun read i found this book after watching hayao miyazaki s masterpiece i had been warned this would be different from the movie but i am glad i went ahead and read it it was really great i loved it and i highly recommend it to anyone who saw the movie and wanted to know more about howl and sophie

5863,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,4,enjoyable but very chaotic i don’t like stories where important information is hidden from the reader without any clue to untangle the lines you are kept in darkness all along only to be flooded with everything on the last couple of pages the romance between sophie and howl is out of the blue there is no hint for that till suddenly it is just there anyway the story is adventurous full of magic humor and mystery i loved calcifer and michael

5880,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,3,i admit that when i started reading this book i expected it to be exactly like the movie but although the miyazaki s version contains the main framework of the book they are for the most part completely different i think once you read the book you ll have a greater understanding of the presence and significance of various characters like the scarecrow the dog and the sister throughout the movie so howl s moving castle follows sophie a young girl who is burdened with very little prospect
5881,Howl's Moving Castle,Diana Wynne Jones,3,howl’s gave us a lot of mixed feelings a few of us really enjoyed the book but others were left barely able to get through the first few chapters so let’s break it down howl’s was a cute fast fun imaginative and charming read for those who finished the concept was original but the story itself was fairly unpredictable the castle was genius who wouldn’t want to move and a door that opened to different places at the turn of a knob about dem characters howl and calcifer were our favor

5896,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,2,num num the writing style is very good however the pacing is super slow if you re going to have a slow pace for me you have to balance it with some sort of engaging psychological gauging of the characters usually with a high dose of empathy or some type of theoretical discussion which is thought provoking or some witty character banter i think if you like old school fantasy and it s pacing you ll love this if you don t then not so much

5910,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,about num years ago when i was a wan neurotic preteen wandering in the suburban wasteland of southern california my daily afterschool routine would lead me to the local library a smallish building tucked under the overhanging boughs of a massive oak it had a more visible neighbor in the even tinier city hall in my later life i would grow to realize that the entire complex from library to city hall to the grocery store and mom and pop joints were one of the last remnants of the old towne
5911,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,this is my first work from tad williams but it definitely won t be my last this is a novel in the high fantasy tradition it s a tale that spans a continent with a quest of dire consequence and rife with complex in depth cultures and characters the dragonbone chair takes obvious influence from j r r tolkien s the lord of the rings most specifically in tone and scope though it is far from a rip off in anyway the story is completely original i also believe tolkien to be only one of many
5912,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,num num stars deservedly rounded up to num stars for the overall enjoyment of this first book in the memory sorrow and thorn series a slow start and one or two sections in which i was lulled into near boredom hence the missing half star in the rating but beyond that a great adventure filled with interesting well developed characters colorfully descriptive and imaginative places and things and plenty of action and intrigue once the story gets going the author s careful attention to painti
5913,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,i enjoyed every word i enjoyed nature of osten ard it s so unlike forgotten realms dragonlance diskworld and shadow of a dark queen less colorful but not less wonderful all point of views were engaging and not cringe worthy i found first half of book more interesting than some later parts but loved part featuring jiriki ice dragon joshua s escape from naglimund simon s dreams i loved simon s dreams and miriamele 
5914,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,i really enjoyed this book once i concentrated on it williams isn t really breaking any new ground in fantasy with it but it s well written and well imagined 
5916,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5, spoilers not really a review but more or less notes to myself some may not care for this book or get bored with it i did not if you liked lotr you will like this yes it could have been shorter yes it could have been more action packed but it is not that kind of a read considering my mood of late this was exactly what i was looking for a nice long detailed story that makes me feel as though i was going on the journey with the characters a nice fantasy comfort read and i loved it i re
5917,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,this is a reread for me preparatory to reading the new series and the heart of what was lost i was pretty excited to plunge back in because i remember being spellbound by it and i gave it a solid four stars i thought i remembered it pretty well and remembered that i’d found it fairly typical in terms of the plot but now some things did somehow surprise me and i’d glossed over great chunks of the plot in mind which is fine because rediscovery is great it is very much an epic in the mode
5918,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,the dragonbone chair was surprisingly really good i m so happy i had that weird furniture card in my uno reading challenge because i found some really good books i loved the world that this book brought me into however it did start off really slow and then got a little bit slower in some parts but it was overall an enjoyable experience the story follows simon a num year old kitchen boy serving within the castle called hayholt his story is also split into three different parts simon mooncal
5919,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,i ve really got to say one thing about this book it s fucking amazing i don t think i ve ever been engrossed in a fantasy book like this before but i m getting ahead of myself again and should start from the beginning it all started last year when i decided to surf through different books on my phone choosing what to read and reading samples of book i found interesting and one of those books was this after reading the blurb and finding out it is a classic story of a kitchen scullion who l
5920,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,i m giving this a num num i know a lot of my goodreads friends have given this num stars and say it s one of the best fantasy series out there but i just can t rate it that high i felt there were too many long drawn out sections too much description and songs and not enough plot advancement i liked it but it s very much a rip off of tolkien a special snowflake orphaned common boy finds out he s special and goes on a long journey/quest to save the world from the evil ancient shadow king accom
5921,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,have definitely read this more than once the first time but recently did a re read for which i mostly used the e book version mobility ftw and wanted to preserve my paperback copy as it is falling apart review of re read is attached to ebook edition here my initial rating is num stars not sure why but i really enjoyed re reading it much more than i thought i would so it was bumped up to num stars hmm

5923,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,maybe a rip off straight from the main ideeas of j r r tolkien but let s face it tad williams has a good strong voice of his own until this volume ended the main character doesn t find out that his a special boy he just consider itself to be a very common orphan that gets to lives from a fatidic day the adventure of it s life the writing is smooth easy to get into yes there are a lot of stories and songs but on the other hand there aren t too long so they didn t bother me a lot an
5924,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,actual rating num num stars i must confess that this series has been sitting on my bookshelf for a very long time now and i have somehow always skipped over it partly due to its bulkiness and also partly because of so many discouraging reviews curiosity won over eventually and i gave it a try from the beginning itself i didn’t really love it the pace was extremely slow and practically nothing significant happened in the first half of the book at times it felt like dragging and the main hero sim
5925,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,my inner child rejoices the older i grow the more i turn back this tale came from my deepest dreams and wishes a slow paced yet greatly climacting epic story full of things i love great forests tall snowclad mountains ancient cities and ruins vast labyrinthian keeps with mysterious caverns below dark magic and sorcerers masters and their puppets ancient evil storms gathering lots of winter and campfires in the night norsemen warriors mysterious enigmatic elven ppl so many things

5927,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,i am a fan of dark fantasy so i has my doubts i would be able to finish this long book being traditional epic/high fantasy fare the novel has a frustrating slow pace at times but there is enough adventure within its num pages to fill a trilogy i am surprised this book is not better known i liked it a lot 
5928,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,a story needs “hook” an intangible quality that instantly appeals the giddiness from a treat within reach the dragonbone chair failed to hook at first impression whereupon it sat languishing on my shelf until a confluence of events tipped it into my favor in good conscience i cannot recommend this book to everyone time is too precious for investing into a num page story with an unremarkable blurb that reads like vanilla bildungsroman especially one that devours half the book in ex

5930,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,wow where to begin i ll start with some whining just to get out of the way and then on to the praise so stay with me here a lot of people have warned me that the beginning is a little slow which i can see and understand the first num pages or so are dedicated to establishing daily life and mainly introducing the more important characters of the novel but the hardest part for me wasn t the slow beginning but rather two specific sequences that forced me to make an effort in continuing readi
5932,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,i avoided this book and series in the past because a friend told me i would hate it and not to waste my time just goes to show you can t trust your friends this book is slow almost painfully slow at first there are a lot of characters and back story and events that mean nothing at first but turn out to be important later once you get past the slow part the book is pretty good detailed amazing world and i really felt drawn in with the charcters i eagerly await my read of the next book

5934,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,the dragonbone chair is the first book in tad williams’ memory sorrow and thorn series and one of the better traditional epic fantasies that’s out there the novel follows the young castle scamp simon an apparently unassuming and unimportant young man who gets drawn into a dire events far beyond his meager station apprenticed to the castle doctor simon spends most of his days dreaming of being a hero but the machinations of an ancient evil soon creep into his own and simon soon finds himself o

5937,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,well i fiiiiiiinally finished this num hours in audio format whew i came pretty close to giving up on this one it has an incredibly slow start and even after it gets going the pacing is still often nothing to write home about not nearly as bad as wheel of time but i wasn t as interested in all the details as i was in wheel of time either i really didn t need to know all four verses of the various songs people were singing throughout for instance and unfortunately i never did becom
5938,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,tad williams is one of my favorite brain candy authors and i decided to reread this series originally read some time in the nums because i am interested in his new series set in the same world i didn t remember much about the story except for the fact that i had enjoyed the depiction of his nonhuman characters and that i had particularly liked the character of josua the reluctant leader of the good guys i identified closely with his personality when i was assembling my library in my early
5939,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,more than one person recommended this book to me with the assertion that it was as good as tolkien so of course this influenced my reading and as i read i evaluated each chapter against tolkien it was easy to do because i recognized so many of the same elements many of them were the same ones tolkien himself took from the scandinavian mythology there was a lot of t h white in there too i kept score in my head tallying up fantasy elements in two columns there was merlin/gandalf/morgenes
5940,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,this was a close call between num and num stars it took me forever to get into this story actually i started it read about num num pages and then put it back on the shelf two years later i took it with me on holiday tried it again i thankfully can jump in were i left of even after long periods of time and put it down again but then it happened i ve read all my other books and there was still num days of holiday left so rather than not reading at all i picked it up again and so i trudged t
5941,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,at first this book seems like a very traditional fantasy a kingdom in crisis a young man of humble origins a dark force on the horizon a desperate quest shadowy fantasy races they are all very stock tropes but then you look at the date its in the nums this series precedes the wheel of time the wars of light and shadow malazan a song of ice and fire this puts a different perspective on things the two strong points of this book are characterization and world building the world is a
5943,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,2,this isn t a terrible book but i think i simply wasn t in the mood for this style of novel having read a goodly chunk before lethargy set in i was determined to keep reading it is a fantasy classic after all i have never been so glad to finish a book in my life my recent root canal was more fun than this in the end and only my personal brand of masochism kept me going in the story the old king and uniter of a troubled land dies and his sons don t like each other ancient baddies are lo
5944,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,i am glad i finally got around to reading this book – it was long on my to read pile i expected this to be a middle of the road typical high fantasy novel i was wrong while it didn’t have a lot of new plot or character elements it did have good ones i was also suprised to recognize the roots of several of my favourite fantasy novels the first num pages were fairly lackadaisical a meandering glimpse into the life of the young innocent main character – slow plot wise this book has a lot of
5945,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,this is the third time i ve reread this series since i stumbled on it a long long time ago in the faraway galaxy of my teenage years and i can say with no reservations that it s my favourite series to reread it s one of those worlds where every time i return there it s like a long overdue catch up with old beloved friends i love these characters this world i love the unique quality that arises from mixing fantasy staples with elements from history and myth and then throwing onto that canv
5946,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,2,num num i thought the first installment of memory sorrow and thorn was very mediocre thinking back on this book not a whole lot actually happened that required the page count yes the step by step feel of the book gave it the epic feeling that it helped define in the genre but simon just wasn t that interesting of a character to me i ll probably continue the series because the last num pages or so were much better than the previous num i really hope to have more miriamele in later books i c
5947,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,this was a re read well a listen to an old read as i got the finally released audiobook still a masterpiece of fantasy and the narrator is just perfection i was worried it d lose some of it s effect in audio it is num hours long and i have the attention span of a gnat when listening rather than reading but the performance was fantastic his binabik was delightful which i was most most happy about one must never skimp on my favourite troll i m shirty i have to wait til november for
5948,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,num num stars it has been awhile since i read this and it is on my list of books to re read so this review may change in the future i remember thinking that the book was well written epic fantasy that had some really interesting characters and back story i also remember that the book seemed to drag and was much longer than the story needed thus i liked it but i thought it could have been better plotted 
5949,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,1,that was unpleasant written before marketing demons got involved the need for unwarranted strong female character to boost the book acceptance by the other side of aisle was not in play so you won t find warrior princess or any such nonsense god damm those money hungry new writers
5950,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,this book felt so slow it took a while for anything to happen or end 
5951,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,1,i had high hopes for this novel however sadly it came across as painfully clichéd maybe i just read too many fantasy books but it was one of those stories where a few chapters in i could already tell what was going to happen sigh let me put it this way i bought this meaty enough looking book to read on my daily hour plus train commute because i get bored very quickly most of the time when i had this book as my only other option i was more inclined to just sit with my arms folded and stare
5953,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,well that was interesting the dragonbone chair is a strong beginning to a fantasy story that is different than a lot of what you will find today it is also a very traditional fantasy story featuring tropes that are well beaten into the ground by now but were perhaps a bit less so in the late nums when this book first came into being the generational difference is what i found so fascinating i like many books that i ve read in recent years in the genre but particularly within the realm of
5954,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,i ve become astonished at the number of people who complain that a num page novel the first in a num page trilogy takes so long to get started the verb i often use is stately the current vogue for stories that begin in media res is to blame for this as well as the way that publishers have become conditioned to think that we need constant action and adventure to satisfy us however mr williams spends roughly num pages setting things up for us we learn about the background to the story w
5956,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,the dragonbone chair was originally published in num and i feel like an idiot for not having picked it up earlier what a fantastic book i listened to the audible audio book version and the narrator was just superb he performed the text beautifully and had a wonderful range of voices from norsemen to trolls women and a certain special teenage boy everything that the fantasy lover in me wanted was delivered i loved the slow build up the world building the hints at paranormal and ma

5958,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,i actually don t know how to rate this book so i m just not going to but maybe not rating it will lead to confusion it s not difficult to say how i feel about this i really enjoyed it and i m pretty solidly invested in the characters it s a very interesting book in a hundred different ways williams is doing amazing worldbuilding here presenting an enormous world with fully realised civilisations and cultures which i m excited to see more of i think the most interesting thing about the no
5959,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,mixed feelings about this one i m not loving it but i do admit it certainly got better and better as it moved along to the end num more books of num pages each so i m thinking it might be something i really need to love to complete it s rather old fashioned epic fantasy and it contains all the tired tropes and cliches of the sub genre reluctant young hero coming of age a fool main character that allows for heavy world building exposition elves are so lithe and magical and ever so precious

5967,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,2,i was recommended this after asking about any books that are as good as the a song of ice and fire series or the lord of the rings trilogy and i wish the recommendation never came i feel like the last three weeks were a waste i consider myself a fast reader but with this one i felt as if i really took my time the story felt dragged on the dialog was boring and not very gripping i also wasn t very impressed with the characters but because the concept of the story appealed to me i pushed on
5968,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,tad williams really did a great job on this series and this first book stands out i m very very tempted to give it num stars but when i read it several years ago i thought it was a bit too ya for me at the time maybe when i read it again i ll think otherwise or perhaps it s just one you should read in high school either way it s a good book and i do see myself reading the first volume of the series again at some point i recommend you read it soon if you haven t 
5969,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,this is a gem in the genre of fantasy and is overlooked because it is older old school fantasy with great character building description of the environment without the cheesy and prepubescent tone of most fantasy writing i was interested in the story line the way it was written and the dark tone that came with it would recommend to the brahs out there 
5970,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,i was disappointed by this book there were huge chunks of fairly boring filler that had no real bearing on the story itself the book itself was in need of a good editing i am a fan of tad williams but this fell short 
5971,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,review to come when i ve gathered my thoughts
5972,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,2,there is a certain style to the fantasy books of an earlier era a style that sets it apart from the grim fantasy that we ve come to love through the works of grrm abercrombie mark lawrence etc i ve never been a fan of this style but i understand the fact that they are the product of their time and the taste that existed when they were written the dragonbone chair is not a bad book however at least for me it is not a good book either grrm has stated that this book inspired him to write a
5973,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,this review will not be particularly well structured but i want to highlight what i loved and what was challenging for me to work through this was a weird read for me this is clearly an older fantasy story beautifully told and full of incredible descriptions yet i struggled the book is divided in three parts the first is a num read the second part was my worst nightmare i could not focus on the chapter i kept restarting chapters because i was not entirely following what was happening t

5977,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,well i tried to write this as positives and negatives but the two were too intermingled to be separated style on the whole good writing with some excusable mistakes and awkwardness the one unexcusable writing mistake he does is have his main character use the word mooncalf two or three times every time he talks to himself so sick of that word he sounds like tolkien except a bit easier to digest his descriptions really work usually and sometimes strike me with their poetry his songs

5984,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,all the criticisms i ve read in other reviews that the book is a tolkien imitation and it takes a long time for the plot to kick in and the young male protagonist is blank slate bland well they re valid all the same i found myself completely wrapped up in this book and in its sequels the world building is magnificent the threat is unnerving and supporting characters like binabik jiriki josua and isgrimnur are engaging it s been over ten years since i ve read this series yet i can
5986,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,out of all of williams books that i have read this one has not been the best it got off slow which i was expecting i remember the numst of the otherland series was excrutiatingly slow in part due to the introductions to the stories of the vast amount of characters involved in the story the first of ms t is also quite slow but not in the same way unfortunately its just slow plain simple i don t find the characters particularly simon nearly as interesting as the characters willia
5987,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,the dragonbone chair by tad williams is the first of three books in the series memory sorrow and thorn it s common for a lot of fantasy books to start off slow but this took forever for anything to start happening i would split this book up into three parts the beginning which was so slow that i almost stopped reading the book it s seriously is just character development and world building for almost num pages the middle plot actually started to move a bit and became somewhat interesting
5988,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,what s the opposite of a spoiler i m going to give away in vague terms something that happens but only because if i don t say this i will be considered a liar with bad taste in books here s the deal this trilogy was very satisfying inventive not derivative a genuine pleasure to read however i m passing along the same advice that was given to me by the person who recommended it in this book there is a long passage fairly early on that involves the main character making a long journey und
5989,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,a thoroughly enjoyable read with a deliberately paced build up that like the gentle clack clack clack of an old fashioned wooden roller coaster lulls you into a contemplative mood before dropping you off a cliff all the classic elements are here a nefarious power behind the throne a band of companions bound by honor and loyalty castles magic and swords of great power what keeps it interesting though is the protagonist he may not always do the heroic thing he may be filled with doubt
5990,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,i really enjoyed this book yes the start is slow but i thought that was good it set the scene for what life was like before it all starts changing the language is dense and descriptive and sometimes it seems to almost get in the way but it bothered me no more than reading tolkien does considering the age of this book i think it holds up fairly well to the modern reader ok there were no shocking twists or whatever and you can kind of see where everything is going but i more attribute that to
5991,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,does not live up to its billing as original and have i said how much i dislike holy fool tropes yes i believe i have once you get past jesus and okay i ll grant you parsifal it s not original not to mention elf/fair folk like beings who tend west dwarf/troll like beings dark he shall not be named you know who wizard ish guys who don t tell you anything etc 
5992,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,this is it the real deal immersive engrossing magnificently plotted and characterized and crafted fantasy at its finest it s only taken my sister a good num years to get me to read it but i m so glad i did i really wish i had read this years ago when i was looking for really good fantasy but better late than never 
5993,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,memory sorry and thorn is better epic fantasy than jordan s the wheel of time the characters are fresh and real the world is creative and beautiful and the adventure is at times incredibly powerful read it this trilogy is as mature as tolkien and as adventurous as david eddings 
5994,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,despite a somewhat slow start i found this lengthy story utterly enthralling i liked the characters the world the pacing and the storytelling itself looking forward to reading the rest in the series 
5995,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,i loved this book it sucked me right in my full thoughts on the series will be posted in my review for the last book my favourite character was josua and i was terrified from minute one that he d be killed off i always seem to go for the grim scholarly second son

5997,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,my personal favourite this is beautiful epic fantasy with characters to fall in love with a deep and living world with many mysteries and a plot that leaves you wanting more 
5998,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,2,tried reading it twice both times stopped around page num or so simply too slow once as a kid i might have liked this kind of thing but not anymore 
5999,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,a bit slow in the middle and a lot of strange names and words 
6000,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,may contain lethal doses of epic fantasy 
6001,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,so good to be back in osten ard num
6002,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,familiar well written fantasy there s really not much to say nothing brilliant or new here but also nothing to complain about 
6003,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,wow what a book this is one of those that affects people profoundly this is one of those i wish i d read num years ago when i needed it most i see in other reviews here and elsewhere people saying similarly that simon the protagonist or at least central focus mirrored the way they looked at the world at a certain age even more so than other books in this or other genres one might argue it s in the way simon looks at the world the way he dreams of adventures and is both mature and im
6005,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,slow start but it s nevertheless an enjoyable set up to getting to know the setting some of the history of osten ard and the characters of course will finish the review when it isn t the middle of the night 
6008,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,simon grew up in the high king pester john’s castle as no one really special he was half raised by the doctor and head maid when pester john dies the kingdom is rocked by his son elias who takes the throne there is something wrong with elias and it slowly becomes apparent as the story goes on simon finds elias’s brother prince josua locked in an underground cell in secret simon and the doctor help josua and in the chaos of it all they are found out soon simon has to leave and travel a
6009,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,new review gah i almost loved this book on the brink of love but just really liking it i enjoyed simon s travels and learning about the land of osten ard but i got to say i wasn t engaged in the war that was happening between king elias and prince josua there wasn t enough explanation on why elias wanted to capture and/or kill josua the only reason was because it was josua s fault that elias wife had been killed but josua felt terrible about it and it bothers him everyday why would elias
6010,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,i picked this up after seeing it mentioned so often as the inspiration for great contemporary fantasy writers i can see why this is classic epic fantasy for better or sometimes for worse the world building is wonderful with magical descriptions varied cultures and species interesting cultural details and gorgeous vistas the characters are reasonably nuanced the plotting among all the various kings and princes and lords and a very small number of ladies are complex and believable 
6011,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,review originally posted at once upon a time simon is a teen aged kitchen boy in the ancient hayholt castle he isn’t very good at the tasks the mistress of chambermaids sets him instead preferring to daydream and make believe around the castle grounds and buildings everything changes for simon when a series of events is kicked off by old king john’s death john’s eldest son becomes king elias but he keeps odd and sinister company with a priest and the golden age of king john’s reign starts t
6012,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,1,did not finish good writing good characterization excellent audio narration tedious and boring after listening for twenty hours i realized that i still have no idea what s going on because the author is so incredibly stingy with information beyond something terribly mysterious name drop name drop name drop that i just couldn t care anymore at some point you have to give us enough information to care about what s going on in the world that point should occur within the first twenty hour
6013,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,spoilers ahead pat rothfuss recommended this one on his podcast and that s why i got in the way back machine and picked up this fantasy classic it is rambling and bloated and therefore my review will be as well for those who can t wait here is the readers digest version good story likable relatable characters good world building too long this story could have been delivered with more impact in about num pages instead of num long version the bad too much teen angst and fitful dream
6014,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,tad williams has crafted a richly detailed back story full of character development history and settings with as strong a sense of character as simon although the tale moves slowly as many first volumes in a series do the details set the stage for events to come later there is a great deal of foreshadowing there is a delicate balance between the sharing of history and showing the challenges that the characters presently face between the myths and legends that haunt people s mind and th
6015,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,i really enjoyed this book and plan to continue with the next asap the characters dialogue action and plotting are all top notch the setting is if not terrifically unique see below well realized and while it starts off a bit slow a common enough issue with epics once it gets moving it s very hard to put down williams take on elves is a little different than most though not drastically so and dragons are treated with more respect so to speak than many similar settings insofar as
6016,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,the dragonbone chair is the first book in the memory sorrow and thorn trilogy the is an epic fantasy story and the author spends a lot of time building the world of osten ard complete with multiple races religions and a dark history involving a clash between humans and an elf like race called the sithi if you can get past the opening chapters of the book which i found dreadfully slow and boring the story eventually turns into an interesting good versus evil conflict focused around sim
6017,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,to me the three books that make up memory sorrow and thorn are one single extremely long novel i will thus make a common review for the series and say a few different things about each book in particular afterwards the series tad williams certainly is a very neat writer the writing style is very accessible these are the type of books that you can put down in the middle of a sentence and pick up a few days after and immediately pick up where you left off this not being sufficient to make an
6018,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,this was another re read i m on a mission to read all my past favorites and break them down from a writer s point of view and hopefully learn to write better by trying to figure out the magic the beginning of this book weeds out the undetermined it s so slow there s a lot here meant to establish a foundation for later action and mystery so while it s important to character arcs and world building it s dense the info dumps of reading textual history are the worst i can only imagine beta re
6019,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,i just completed this book yesterday i tried once before but was thwarted but williams long winded style i am glad i tried it again williams does a great job with character development in this book simon the main character starts out a careless child he s not quite a brat but not exactly well mannered either this book while containing the beginnings of a world destroying evil is essentially about the development of simon from boy to man the plot development in this book while slow 
6020,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,a great trilogy and a must have for every high fantasy fan from magic swords and mysterious elf like creatures to giants and evil sorcerers it has everything you d look for in a classic quest fantasy with the growing popularity of a song of ice and fire new readers may find a resemblance between the storytelling of the two series the opening chapters of memory sorrow and thorn tend to revolve mostly around the not so thrilling main protagonist simon but let s face it neither was
6021,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,2,this is a slightly older series from the late nums which the author himself describes as a bloated epic and bloated it is the third book of the trilogy is actually two num page paperbacks i originally became interested in tad s trilogy after reading his short story the burning man in the legends anthology and then discovering on the internet that this series was very popular what intrigued me most was that his fantasy world has a version of the catholic church in his books jesu
6022,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,tad williams is a gifted writer and one of my favorite authors i first read this tale many years ago having grabbed it off the shelf because it had two things i wanted a story about dragons which it wasn t lol and it was thick i needed a book that would last me a while well this story is so engaging that you don t notice how long it is i have re read the whole series at least once and was thinking about getting it on audiobook so i can listen to it while i work but sadly it isn t a
6023,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,i read this whole series and i felt a little bit like i wasted num months of my life that is a total i have actually been picking up and putting down this series for a year my first tad williams book was the war of the flowers which i put down after about num pages then num months later i picked it back up and breezed through the rest in about a week the war of the flowers was the first really good book i had read in a long time in turn i wanted to read more good books so i picked up the dra
6024,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,this is a review for the entire memory sorrow and thorn series including this book stone of farewell and two parts of to green angel tower i was introduced to tad williams by an online community and decided to try out his first major fantasy series to see what the big deal what about the mst series is written as a coming of age story about a young kitchen boy who must embark on a perilous journey to save the kingdom it s suitable for some younger readers but won t leave older readers
6025,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,memory sorrow and thorn series book num this is the first of a trilogy each book is very thick this is an epic fantasy written in the late nums it is going to start out very slow there is going to be the on the road traveling sections that can be slow to mildly interesting since this is where we see character relationship and world building it is going to be an indepth wonderful world full of all different kinds of characters there is magic dragons fighting adventure there are parts w
6026,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,i loved this book my husband warned me it would be a slowburner but i was hooked from almost the very start simon is a very lovable main character and i loved the friendship that formed between him and the troll binabik this friendship made all the hardships they have to endure more beareable the world building is done very expertly it is a great world and my heart really went out to all the people in it when large portions of it were destroyed 
6027,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5, i ve dreamt in my life dreams that have stayed with me ever after and changed my ideas they ve gone through and through me like wine through water and altered the colour of my mind and this is one look i ll be honest this is not getting a num star rating because the book is perfect or without issues but because there s a reason that it s referred to as a seminal work of fantasy that has influenced later writers i actually had to go and google game of thrones a song of ice and fire
6028,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,num num stars finally it seemed like it took forever to finish this book it iss about num pages but when reading num pages a day that was my goal to finish before the due date at the library feels like it takes hours there s something wrong here it doesn t help that the first maybe num pages almost nothing at all happens i don t want to be completely negative about this book though i did enjoy it at times i liked the characters and felt like i knew the featured ones by the end of the boo
6029,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,i love reading tad williams i hate reading tad williams i love reading tad williams his prose flows like no other his words come together in a way that makes them almost disappear into the image of the world i hate reading tad williams it is so loooooooooong exciting moments like the escape from the castle or the discovery of a burned out monastery are separated by hundreds of pages of eyeball bleeding stretches of nothing i love reading tad williams his world and creatures are some of the
6030,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,i can t quite pinpoint why this series resonates so much with me it definitely has its flaws it borrows themes and characters from other stories it is excruciatingly long it hits on some well worn fantasy clichés magic swords mysterious wizard mentors a wolf and peasant becomes king and there are is a smattering of tolkien esque contrivances that would be cringe worthy except i don’t know maybe because i walked past the book and stared at the cover for months in the bookstore before i
6031,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,i just finished this book for the second time audiobook this time about num years after my first reading and it s quite as good as i remember the reader is excellent and the content is rich deep and full of fantastic character development and stories within stories williams has long been one of my favorite writers for his strong and numerous characters and for his excellent writing style the dragonbone chair lays the groundwork for this epic series and provides the history of a broad wo
6032,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,i read a thing that told me this was one of george r r martin s major influences for a song of ice and fire so i added it to my reading list and i liked this one great world building and williams adds depth that is usually lacking in fantasy/adventure novels martin adds even more depth but his inspiration is clear if i listed them there would be a lot of spoilers here that martin blatantly copied and adapted so although this book is typical in that it follows certain conventions fo
6033,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,tad williams s memory sorrow and thorn series is definitely in my top five for fantasy adventure epics everything one could ask for from an engrossing epic is here an unlikely hero a mysterious wizard a dwarf whose dialect sounds like english translated from german elves twisted demonic villains religious symbolism druids living in solitude long lost underground cities the list goes on and on while some with whom i have discussed these books and williams s other novels believe
6034,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,it kind of takes a while to get going i put it down at num i picked it up again after finishing terry goodkind s confessor series comparatively confusing pronunciation everywhere slightly confusing geography and dialects and just confused until suddenly i wasn t and oh it s worth the slog simon is a lovely lovely clever character i wondered at the start if he was a little slow but then so am i so perhaps i was self identifying a bit there anyway he s gorgeously drawn as are his
6035,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,while this book may start off with a slower pace tad williams shows he has mastered this quality in reading his book builds suspense until the reader feels like he or she cannot put the book down until tad has resolved the current dilemma the author then takes that built suspense and funnels it to propel the reader through impressive amounts of detail and history from the world of this series the characters in this novel are strong and full of character and tad makes the reader feel like they
6036,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,2,ok i tried got through num of the num chapters and i just can t take any more there s a story here i want to read and williams definitely has talent but damn does he need an editor his long winded descriptions are maddening and unnecessary the actual action that has taken place in the first num chapters could have easily taken place in num tell me the king died and his funeral was well attended don t give me an extra six hundred words detailing the precise way his body was wrapped and prepar
6037,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,loved it and this launches one of the greatest fantasy series ever written just wow an orphan boy prophecy magic swords dark lords magic knights adventure i admit to having read this series about num times so naturally i am biased toward the loved it category i was pretty young the first time i read it and never before had i been captivated so much by an authors use of words each sentence just seemed marvelously put together the story starts out with simon in the hayolt just sorta
6039,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,this was a difficult book to finish i can t say its bad cause its not the writing is sufficiently tight and the character enjoyable enough even the setting is quite vivid and yet there was something keeping me from diving head first in to this book it may have been entirely me i ve read so much epic fantasy by now that the story of a young kitchen boy swept up in world changing events and dark evil plots may just seem too cliched to this jaded reader it definitely worth a read since th
6040,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,i really must reread this series as for num years i ve been telling people that it is the best fantasy trilogy after tolkien and one should never even make a book recomendation based on a book one only read in highschool i have hope that it will still be good as i read it at a time when i did have taste post eddings shanara etc and could appreciate how williams built characters setting and both played with and worked outside of traditional trappings of fantasy i m putting it on my
6042,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,no idea how to rate this one it’s far too long at least num pages could be cut off easy the pacing is awful the first half of the book nothing happens but despite all that when it’s good it’s actually alright not amazing by any stretch but it’s enjoyable typical cliffhanger ending fooling me into wanting to read the next one which i will eventually but for now something new num stars seem a fair middle ground didn’t hate it although i was close sometimes and didn’t love it accepta
6043,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,wow just wow there are meant to be words coming from my mouth and my keys but there aren t this was just so good i love and want to smack simon upside the head in the beginning at least i ve always loved the average person goes on a journey trope and this scratched an itch i didn t even realize i had i m so interested to see how a couple of different plot points work out keeping it vague here for spoilers i have the second on my shelf picked up from god knows where but i think i m prob
6044,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,i ve lost track of how many times i ve read this one of my favorite epic fantasies is it a cliche yes the main character is a castle scullion who is destined for greater things not exactly an original idea but it s so well executed the first section of the book before simon goes off on his adventure is a bit slow and i couldn t quite get past it the first time i tried to read to book once i was able to overcome that though i lost myself in the world williams created 
6046,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,the beginning is a bit slow it took me several days of slogging through it before it finally got good enough for me to be convinced it was worth reading it took me longer than usual to read it because it didn t hold my interest as well as it could have but it isn t a bad book it s actually a good book and well written it just wasn t as exciting as i m used to reading otherwise i d have given it a five and read it within three days rather than a couple of weeks 
6047,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,an epic tale of good versus evil the tale begins with a scullion boy in a castle who wants more for his life but doesn t know how to get it he is curious but also innately kind and thoughtful acquiring guides along the way the boy begins to learn finds adventure maybe even more than he bargained for who is he and why is he so important to the story i will probably have to read the next book to find out 
6048,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,many of the reviews for this book are correct it is a very slow read for the first num/num of the book then it really picks up by the end i was pretty invested in the characters and enjoyed the read and i plan on reading the next book the amount of characters and their hard to remember names the numerous plot lines and the constant bashing of catholicism i am not catholic sometimes gave me pause as to whether i would continue reading this book 
6049,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,when i first read this at age num i really didn t grasp the complexity of the story i spent most of my time unable to delay gratification and skipping ahead to see what happened to simon i m almost done with it now at age num and i am enjoying it much more i remember enough to keep me going but its full of new surprises now that i am mature enough in my critical reading skills to take pleasure in 
6050,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,i have to take some time off and think before reviewing the dragonbone chair i give it num now as the book is really pretentious but on the other hand this was something i kinda disliked i can t stop feeling that the author wrote this book already as an epic high fantasy book and i hate it anyway despite my personal problems it was a good book 
6051,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,i tried but couldn t finish it i thought it was very imaginative and the world building was amazing i can see why it has earned a place in the pantheon of the best of fantasy but the pacing just kept getting bogged down every time i put it down it took a while to pick it up again until finally i stopped trying it lacked the tension that i love in terry brooks novels 
6053,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,this isn t a book this is a mother fucking epic it was rather hard getting started into this book but my god it is so complex deep well thought and driven this book will definitely be one of my top suggestions to anybody who enjoys reading fantasy 
6054,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,this started out kind of slow there is quite a bit of stage setting and backstory that i found a little tedious to slog through but it does end up paying dividents as the plot s pace picks up considerably in the last third of the book looking forward to the other num books in the series 
6055,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,one of the best contemporary epic fantasy trilogies treading in the same ground of course as tolkein brooks and many others but yet with a freshness and emotion that many of his contemporary authors lack i have a signed hardcover copy by tad williams 
6056,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,i ve read this book about num times over the last twenty years and i will read it again it engulfs me into the world of osten ard every time and the strikingly different societies that occupy this world
6057,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,a little bit slow in the beginning but i am somewhere at the numish page so giving it more chance to prove hope it will actually i will put the book a side and finish it some other time i have a feeling it deserves to be read but i am just not in the mood at this point giving up 
6058,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,wow absolutely stands the test of time i ve read it a few times before but the last time was over a decade ago sharing the journey with these characters is like visiting lifelong friends rich compelling storytelling from start to finish bring on book num 
6059,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,though this was actualy a re read which i discovered slowly page by page not being sure at the start as i read feist as well and i think he found some inspiration in this book i again enjoyed it and want to continue re reading the whole series my compliments mr williams 
6060,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,i am rather sentimental about this book since this series got me into fantasy/speculative fiction i suppose it might lose a star if i were to reread it now but in my head it is a great fantasy read 
6061,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,reading this novel is not a light endeavor but it is well worth it while the narrative is sometimes slowed by the pure density of the prose that same richness of language and description sets the world and characters of the dragonbone chair in the rarest of company in epic fantasy 
6063,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,a stunning epic fantasy really good vivid deep complex rich world and characters can t wait to tear into more of this great series and author 
6064,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,i usually devour tad williams books but i found this book to be a bit slow going 
6065,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,one of my favorite books ever read 
6066,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,i m not sure about this book it took about num pages before i was interested and then the ending just it s a cliffhanger i liked it but not sure if enough to read the next few books 
6067,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,i remember reading this whole series when i was about num i want to read it again soon i absolutely loved these books back then 
6068,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,this was good series 
6069,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,i loved this book that is saying a lot considering fantasy has never been a genre i pick up or usually finish simon is a great character and i enjoyed being part of his adventures 
6070,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,huge story with slow start just not my kind of story
6071,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,fantastic tale with good turns and unexpected turns the end book num was a bit of a letdown 
6072,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,classic epic good but very slow paced 
6073,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,a good trilogy excellent twist at the very end a little minimalist on the magic system but that s a style choice 
6074,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,the qanuc have another saying welcome stranger the paths are treacherous today love the beginning of a great saga 
6075,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,excellent story little slow at first but well worth finishing 
6076,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,i read this long before i was a goodreads member i remember as being pretty standard epic s s fantasy not boring but not memorable 
6077,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,a good beginning to the series this is the second read through i ve done and i really see things i did not notice before 
6078,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,superb story the stuff that makes up dreams the whole trilogy is awesome 
6079,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,if you are a fantasy fan it doesn t get better than this 
6080,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,a little slow to start but an enjoyable read 
6081,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,the first book of the greatest fantasy saga ever 
6082,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,read these three books then stop everything else he s ever written just pales by comparison but these three these are magic 
6083,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,1,i didnt like this book after num pages nothing happened the whole num pages is about some boy in a castle where nobody likes him boring
6084,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,this is the book i was searching for forever i m glad i found it recently i have been very dissatisfied with so many of the highly recommended books in the fantasy genre some of the books i hated have a rating above num num here on gr here are the landmines commonly found in popular fantasy titles which were blessedly absent in this book num dystopian world of oppression and doom num characters so unbelievable they belong in a comic book and should never show their mary sue badass faces in the world
6085,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,this isn’t an easy book tad williams eases you in with familiar fantasy tropes by dropping you into the world of osten ard where you follow the day to day life of a scullion and the drama surrounding the impending succession of a great king it all feels nice and cosy and is made that much more pleasant as a result of williams’ evocative prose after reading this book i’d venture to say that williams is one of the best sentence crafters in all of fantasy the book then takes a dip in the firs
6086,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,ooooooo this is the start of something epic i love this genre it gives you so much to think about such hope and such despair the feeling that fate and destiny are truly just a matter of choices some made by yourself some made by others this was masterfully written to illustrate that how a bumbling air brained dreamer can be in the center of a vortex of change without any perceivable determined obvious choice just what seems to be random chances and circumstances it s a very interes
6087,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,4,contents pg no sex no swearing but grim death sad scenes some torture and various gruesome creatures i especially enjoyed the terrifying scene with the nest of ghants i read the trilogy so this review reflects all three books told in third person my favorite pov for fiction high fantasy with kings wizards dragons trolls elves fair ones / sithi giants etc the theme is grim enough but the brave fellowship holds together despite some losses even the animals i especially l
6088,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,5,i m having a hard time deciding whether this book deserves four stars or five because it took me so god damned long to slog through it it was full of beauty and wonder and real feeling but a page turner it was not i read it in three bursts separated by months and in a world filled with books of comparable length that i find myself tearing through in a matter of days it seems like something that didn t grab me with so tight a hold maybe shouldn t get full marks the thing is though that t
6089,The Dragonbone Chair,Tad Williams,3,okay before i begin a little history my father bought this book the very copy i just finished in fact shortly after it went to paperback and read it to the family aloud during a camping trip i was a teenager already over fantasy and mainly into science fiction particularly of the televised variety i listened with half an ear years later in my early num s i tried reading it for myself and got only as far as the first few chapters of the second book before i decided i lost patience bu
6090,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,i have spent a long time searching for a modern fantastical epic which is worth reading it seems like there should be one out there somewhere i have so enjoyed the battlefields of troy the dank cavern of grendel s dam dido s lament ovid s hundred wild spun tales perfidious odysseus the madness of orlando satan s twisted rhetoric and gilgamesh s sea voyage to the forgotten lands of death and so i seek some modern author to reinvent these tales with some sense of scholarship poetry c

6092,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,i have always detested michael moorcock as a fantasy reader whose passion for tolkien’s writing knows no boundaries i have always had a hard time swallowing the venomous spite and blind arrogance with which he’s been denouncing the champion of my fantasy dreams generally speaking i never felt anything against authors who attempted to step out of tolkien’s shadow these separatists as i enjoy calling them count shining stars like mervyn peake and china mieville among their ranks both men i

6094,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,this is some epic awesomeness i m an absolute sucker for the grand sweeping personal quests to gain more and yet more magical power in the service of rescuing your one true love casting aside morals the greater good your own health and possibly your own sanity this tale holds up perfectly after all this time all the best aspects of modern fantasy are encapsulated and written with such spartan clarity and diamond sharpness within moorcock s classic i only needed this one taste and i m now
6095,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,it pleases me to return after many years to the saga of elric viii emperor of melnibone the doomed albino with the icy demeanor and imperious nature whose constant companion is stormbringer a bloodthirsty sword with a consciousness and will all its own elric is the sickly descendant of a haughty alien race a long line of amoral conquerors and wielders of magic many of his nobles—including his cousin the accomplished magician yrkoon—do not think the young emperor is fit for his high task

6097,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,this is the classic sword and sorcery tale that came about in the early nums note that i am referencing when elric first appeared which was in moorcock’s novella the dreaming city science fantasy num june num wiki note that this is one of my early reviews so the format is different concept very interesting this one was done in the nums before there were a lot of sci fi/fantasy writers moorcock is definitely one of the older writers and his works range in quality though fortunately
6098,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,this is the first book of a classic fantasy series with an iconic anti hero from what i understand the author tried to create something different from the lord of the rings at the time this book was published the majority of fantasy genre consisted of the lord of the rings clones considering that the series now has a status of genre classics the author succeeded the main hero elric is an albino who happened to be the emperor of melniboné and who must use potions to maintain his strength he
6099,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,2,you know i kept seeing moorcock s elric stories referred to by authors i enjoyed greatly as being totally inspirational and important to the beginnings of new weird fiction which is what people who write urban fantasy but want to be taken seriously call their work so i m going on vacation and i think to myself this ll be the perfect thing to read on the beach or in transit fun surprisingly good etc etc etc as it turns out i m just not seeing it i know that issue may be that i m read

6101,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,originally posted at fantasy literature elric emperor of melniboné is not your typical fantasy hero he’s an albino with white skin long white hair and slanting red eyes he’s weak and has to take drugs every few hours just to maintain the strength of a normal man he’s a brooding and contemplative scholar which makes him dull at parties some people think elric is a demon — he sure looks like one — and many of his subjects would prefer to have the throne of melniboné occupied by elric’s cha
6102,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,1,this book and i disagreed i tend to dislike fantasy books whose language is flowery whose characters are coarse and papery and whose plots are obviously constructions of the authors to be used with appropriately puppet like characters but my friend liked this story so i said i d read it i don t understand how this stuff got popular not at all i read some of it out loud to a discerning friend of mine sometimes in disbelief and unable to stop from laughing and to this day we mak

6105,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,i read this about num years ago and decided to pick it up again i think i liked it a bit better this time because i can better see all of the neat elements that moorcock put into the world of elric elemental lords chaos gods and the war between law and chaos are just a few of the worldbuilding elements that really made this work shine i still can t give it five stars however because elric has got to be one of the dumbest protagonists in fantasy literature i mean how many times do you let
6106,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,a sickly emperor with a demon possessed sword num april num this was one of the earlier fantasy books that does not fall into what i consider the fantasy genre i term as lord of the rings wannabe s elric is not a hero nor is he on a quest to save the world in fact while not going out of his way to destroy the world the character of elric would be more at home as a villain than as the central character of a fantasy series but this is what elric is and these stories originally published as
6108,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,this was a very charming book in its own morbid way elric is the singularly badass emperor of melniboné a debauched weird island nation that used to be a sprawling powerful empire apparently it s considered completely uncool to be anything but self possessed icy and callous on melniboné but elric seems to be of a different stock than most of his pale kin a bit more introspective and even moralistic this alone presents him with several problems and compounding things is his cousin yyrkoo
6110,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,fantasy review barn in the style of an oral storyteller bringing to mind the greek classics in its deeds i admit i was quite surprised by how good elric of melniboné was it is not a question of an old book holding up in this case rather elric is obviously a pace setter that countless that follow can only hope to keep up with if anything i have proven to myself that some of the classics of the genre are considered so for a reason i will drop a minor heresy in that given a choice i would rer
6111,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,1,i realy wanted to like this book spoilers i was hearing the usual things that everyone hears about elric it s supposed to be the birth of dark fantasy its hero is complex and morally ambiguous there are adult themes and so on and so forth and i found almost nothing to like about this book the characters were worse than two dimensional the fragile princess that gets to be rescued the evil moustache twirling cousin the noble right hand man and elric himself a brooding relentlessly e
6112,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,i picked this for my reading challenge and i was not disappointed but rather pissed at myself that i was putting it away for so long i was surprised how fresh it felt considering that elric was born somewhere between years num and num quite a fast paced story rather short and not overly detailed it takes us into the decadent and violent land of melniboné where sorcerers live side by side with dragons and demons of higher and lower planes melnibonéans drown their days in cruel rituals a
6113,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,i read this one years ago when i ran across this audio version i picked it up having not read any of the eternal champion volumes for a long time it sort of reminded me how much i liked many of them this short book serves as a sort of intro to the entire elric saga and we get a look at much of the character mr moorcock was building for elric and i d forgotten how annoying elric could be this these actually as it applies to the elric series is a book i d recommend for anyone who likes
6114,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,in which elric fights off his cousin s usurpation first strikes a deal with arioch and other higher powers meets rackhir the red archer acquires the sword stormbringer and makes a lot of terrible choices in the name of defying fate and the powers that be overwrought and amateurish and yet still a classic of fantastic literature wonderfully dry you can almost picture him writing these books with one eyebrow continuously cocked at his typewriter compelling a quick read and full of the g

6116,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4, the happiness cannot last unless we know completely what we are there are two kinds of good books one is that book which will make one feel warm and hopeful there is other type which will make one gloomy and depressive and elric of melnibone belongs to the other kind wow i really am impressed from the work of so called anti tolkien writer most of the people agree that j r r tolkien was the father of epic fantasy and many of the novels e g eragon since many of my good friends on g
6117,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,the elric saga is one of the classics of the fantasy genre i think it’s underrated despite inspiring big shot authors like r a salvatore neil gaiman and margaret weiss and some milestone characters of the fantasy genre such as drizzt do’urden and raistlin majere it is rather sad that only the hardcore fantasy geeks have read this incredibly original piece of work this book is a combination of the first three books of the series around num pages or less which are rather short compared to t
6118,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,i ll never forget the first time i heard about elric it was at the high school graduation party of my friend denyse byrd denyse was an intriguing figure to me i never had the courage to ask her out while she did not look like morticia addams she had a certain dark allure about her like morticia if she ever reads this i hope she takes this in a good way anyway at the party denyse mentioned that she d read elric and found something in the books that she never got out of the lord of the

6120,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,better written i feel than the corum series and a better attempt to set the scene and background at once stating that this is to be a more involved and robust set of tales moorcock is such a guilty pleasure 
6121,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,this is how great fantasy should be done
6122,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,couldn t put this one down the prose is gorgeous the pace is swift and elric is fascinating as a sort of anti conan protagonist can t wait to get my hands on the rest of the series 
6123,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,one of the classics of the genre it has aged well odd circumstances and fanciful worlds as with other moorcock works it would pair well with some pink floyd or blue öyster cult playing in the background readers of moorcock would not be surprised to learn that he wrote lyrics for a few böc songs 
6124,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,video review featured in my top num books i read in num as elegant and pleasurable as a melnibonean banquet thanks both to its subtle delicacies and to all the crazy shit going on easily one of the best fantasy novel i ve ever read 
6126,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,still in the mood to re read some old favourites this one jumped out from the shelf at me i wasn t sure whether it would begin a re read of all the elric books or be just a one off i first read this along with a whole swathe of moorcock s work back in the num s some time back then there were still quite a few second hand book stores around where you would often find these old num s paperbacks the real challenge was working out a reading order especially in the days before the internet th
6127,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,num num stars i read an article in the new yorker recently that described michael moorcock as the anti tolkien the article asserts that tolkien supported a conservative vision of the status quo whereas moorcock s elric stories are about law and chaos and how sometimes choosing one over the other is no more or less just you could also make a case that moorcock s writing style is the antithesis of tolkien s too elric of melnibone was published in num though its roots go back to the nums 
6129,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,a very interesting and well written set of books with the central character being elric of melnibone elric is an albino king who is very sickly and weak until he discovers stormbringer a rune sword of incredible power with it he is able to restore himself to the throne and many other things but it is bittersweet the sword stormbringer exacts its own price the whole elric series is well written a fast read and full of twists and changes 
6130,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,beautiful book touching on the conflicting nature of men morality personal gain and destiny it oddly reminded me of ursula k le guin’s work which i think mostly had to do with the writing style moorcock’s writing is simple and concise and it relies mostly on recounting events but somehow still maintains an air of mystery and doesn’t take away from character development i really liked it for a prince of the dragon isle elric of melniboné was primarily an esoteric character 
6131,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,one of my favorites when i was a kid elric is an interesting character and the sword is absolutely awesome
6133,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,well it s a nice book but but but not dark not wild nope nope nope enjoyed though 
6134,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,michael moorcock wrote of his obsession and later friendship with mervyn peake in his introduction to my edition of the gormenghast trilogy that influence is clear here his sentences are not as long and his language not quite as beautiful but it echoes peake s not quite imitative but clearly inspired the writing then is wonderful unlike peake s classic though this is essentially an adventure story and so is short and punchy in the way of swords and sorcery yarns moorcock s hero tho
6136,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,michael moorcock s enhanced audiobooks with dramatic introduction read by michael moorcock and full soundtrack backing are not available on audible or other legal download services which is a shame because while i am fairly new to audiobooks num num a week for num months this is by far the best production of an audiobook i have ever heard a product this good is worthy of being purchased in high quality audio and the artists who created it are deserving of getting paid musical backing would not
6137,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,this is a relatively short first book considering that it is a part of the fantasy genre but manages to plunge the reader quite deftly into the wonderful realm of moorcock s imagination the character of elric is probably the strongest part about this book he is not the typical strongman fantasy protagonist who lets be honest by this time has become quite predictable his flawed nature weak constitution and distaste for authority and power make him refreshing to say the least he mourns th
6140,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,yet another classic i ve been meaning to read for a long time and was glad i got around to the melniboneans are an ancient race of humans characterised by their self importance hedonistic ways and distinct lack of compassion for others very similar to the traditional fantasy dark elves although of course their appearance is human elric is the last in a long line of melnibonean kings he s a sickly albino that has managed to sustain his health and keep up appearances by the heavy use of dr
6141,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,my brothers were really heavily into d d and the swords and sorcery thing when we were growing up and i ended up getting into this series and author after weirdly enough looking at elric on the cover of this book and thinking he was the most interesting looking guy i had ever seen haha anyways this is a great start to what ended up being an awesome series it was easy to fall right into the decadence and politics of melnibone and to feel right at home in this world almost like i was a mem
6142,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,somehow this glorious gem escaped me all these years vintage fantasy written in an old world style reminiscent of norse saga swords and sorcery in a beautifully described intriguing world the hero elric is quintessential strange even in his own realm of melniboné—which to the rest of the mortal world is strange enough—he is tormented and full of insecurities yet he is brilliant and through power and courage drawn from an ancient lineage he overcomes his shortcomings in revolutionary 
6143,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,i ve read this book about num times and i ve enjoyed it each time if this is pulp it s the epitome of the art form moorcock brings a darkness to his fantasy that we don t really see as much anymore it s scary it s heroic it s tragic and it s good note this is the first of the original elric saga and it s a complete novel i say that because subsequent books are more akin to collections of short stories and novellas the notable exception being stormbringer the final novel in the original s
6144,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,i m a little perplexed about all the num and num star reviews the entire time i was reading i kept thinking this is it it s super short there isn t much character development or action it reads like a wikipedia summation of a book i think it s more of a book that i might have wanted to read in middle school i m just not seeing how this series makes a bunch of the must read fantasy lists i am not even sure that i want to bother reading the next books it wasn t bad it just wasn t goo
6145,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,fantasy doesn t mean medieval europe with magic or dragons i don t find any inherent fault with that particular setting i love its dreaminess and perilousness in certain works aka lotr but a great fantasy needs imagination and not just good storytelling a greater fantasy explores alternatives that is why elric of melnibone is great it explores and chooses different things to tell it doesn t tread familiar grounds and does not reach safe pleasant destinations a must read for everyone
6146,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,i barely remember reading this except that i like the art and the story moved along nicely my problem with elric books is that there are multiple realities and universes take note dc comics which makes the events in any one universe or reality largely irrelevant i mean just go to a new universe when you screw the old one up no big deal that kind of takes all the drama out of any planet threatening event doesn t it 
6147,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,2,i read this because neil gaiman talks about it extensively in one of his semi autobiographical short stories it was a fun little adventure but i wasn t as enchanted with it as he was this may be because i am not a num year old boy hey gaiman loves moorcock heh okay maybe i am a num year old boy 
6149,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,2,for most of the numth century conan the barbarian was the most famous specimen of sword and sorcery everyone was making heroes based on him which created a very stale subgenre if you ever read any conan books you know he’s a very dry hero there is nothing special about him as a personality and the world around him doesn’t affect him in some way the same was happening with every other hero of that time including fafhrd and the grey mouser who had invented the term of sword and sorcery so
6152,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,this was way more enjoyable than it had any right to be
6153,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,first off can i just say how glad i am to have finally found this book elric of melnibone has been on my to read list for years and by the time i ve wanted to read it i couldn t find it anywhere the only elric books i could find were the ones in the last emperor of melnibone series i read the first book in that series which was simply a collection of short elric stories while it was fun i enjoyed a full length novel much more the original elric series is nigh impossible to track down i
6154,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,finally tackled this monstrosity and i mean monstrosity in a good way what a descriptive grim story it is filled of terror and evil the hero is only a little less evil than his enemies i can ask see how it influenced dungeons and dragons with relationships with gods and elementals among with intelligent magic items fun now onto ill met in lahnkmar 
6157,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4, and now opens the tragedy which will close many years from now and precipitate the destruction of this world in the land of melnibone the dragon isle a man sits on the ruby throne contemplating the people before him this powerful kingdom after ten thousand years of rule has for the last half century been in decline from its once lofty place in the hands of the right man melnibone might return to its former might in the hands of a cruel ruler bent upon domination melnibone might rise ag
6158,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,1,i loved this when i read the whple series as a kid and i wanted to reread and recapture that unfortunately as an adult i found this book almost unbearable it was a bore to finish despite being short the plot itself didn t interest me and neither did the meta level of philosophy and mythology the writing is one of the worst examples of tell don t show i ve encountered in a long time making the action the characters and the entire world feel distant indistinct and hard to sink into emp
6160,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,1,i think i have clearly reached the edge of where i enjoy fantasy with this one not just reached i suppose but spun right over it i vaguely understand the appeal i understand it s a product of its time but i couldn t even say i thought it was okay for me it s so short and i still had to force myself through every page and ended up skimming the second half not a good sign that i didn t get confused at all but could follow the storyline easily it s just a very i apologise for this in adv
6161,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,i was first introduced to the brooding sorcerer emperor of melnibone in high school and instantly related to his sense of not belonging of always questioning the whys and wherefores of life elric is one of fantasy s most intriguing characters and has sparked some rather heated debates as to whether or not he can be defined as a hero in the classic sense i say yes elric is not conan for which many of us with literary leanings can be profoundly grateful michael moorcock took fantasy o
6162,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,this is very good the first time i read it i didn t appreciate it it seemed too simplistic the characterisation seemed too stark he was going for the easy options i thought the big themes hyperbole hyperdrama then i read a whole lot of fantasy and science fiction novels in the meantime michael moorcock s prose has improved his insights have deepened his characterisation has become more subtle his descriptive powers have been strengthened and his tastes have become more refined when i
6163,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,of all moorcock s creations elric is the greatest a supremely flawed character in a vicious world he is the archetype for so many anti heroes it beggars belief if you want to read the progenitor of the modern fantasy world read moorcock the theme of the eternal champion is explored in multiple incarnations within multiple worlds and ultimately they are all aspects of the same hero woven together over stacked planes of existence apart from the metaphysical moorcock is such an accessible w
6165,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,num num/num stars elric the most powerful sorcerer warrior and emperor of kingdom has been easily tricked by his cousin yyrkoon who has been taken as prisoner escapes and kidnaps elric s beloved princess so the story goes around this act i found this plot rather naive and uncreative hence a bit disappointing still the book is worth reading according to some critics this book is the father of modern fiction epics 
6166,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,oh the imagery loved the lyrical writing the detailed world building and even the character of elric hard to bond with a character in num pages but this author makes a good pitch this book fell short of being a five star read due to the length view spoiler [elric s vengeance seemed rushed and a little light i guess some of the benevolent scholar survived hide spoiler ] 
6167,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,i was once a fan of the card trading game magic the gathering when i found i had duplicates of some rare cards i traded them for the full set of elric novels i must say that i think the shop owner who traded with me was on the losing side of the many books written by michael moorcock the elric series are my favourites i m so glad i made this trade all those years ago 
6168,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,this was my favorite book when i was num i was afraid to read it again for fear it would suck instead it was even better than i remembered smooth and vivid and incredibly imaginative and so much damn fun it s scary i would be ecstatically proud of myself if i had written this book now i get to read the other num 
6170,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,i enjoyed that very much it s my first moorcock book and it made me think his multiverse is very interesting indeed elric viii numth emperor of melniboné is a great character and i ll definitely gonna check out the rest of his story 
6171,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,the earlier of the elric books were the best i think a lot of exotic qualities 
6172,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,elric of melnibone is shlock fantasy hitting the beats you expect out of the genre it’s neither consistently terrible nor consistently better than average some aspects of the world are intriguing while others are boring some of the writing is solid and some is amateurish but overall it’s unsuccessful as it fails to make you care one iota about the by the numbers story that it’s telling until the book is nearly over part one feels languid the unenthusiastic protagonist ruling an empire in d
6173,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,i picked this up expecting something like the drizzt do urden novels that clearly borrowed from elric liberally instead the tone and pacing was much more like reading myths or arthurian legends characters are pretty two dimensional even the protagonist but not in a bad way they come across more as archetypes than as tropes almost all the navel gazing happens through dialogue rather than internal monologue and elric doesn t seem to be brilliant just principled and sometimes unsure of why
6174,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,‘elric’ the name is legendary even those who don’t really touch fantasy tend to know the name ‘elric’ or at very least ‘stormbringer’ those older will know the name ‘moorcock’ too the creator of both the man elric and his sword stormbringer the books were huge huge hits in the num’s and num’s because moorcock was able to create a series that had all the themes of the time sex drugs desire for peace the struggles for freedom and need to follow your own path in a sense now you know
6175,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,elric is emperor of melnibone his fiance has a brother that is after the throne and will stop at nothing to get it elric is an albino that must take medicine to stay alive and able to function this does not sit well with his rival melnibone is attacked and the rival uses this attack to hurt elric i did find the characters were a bit shallow and underdeveloped therefore the rating of num and not num i did like the plot very much i listened to this story and found the story to be very interesti
6176,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,mature fantasy with some great original world building really liked the start and end the opening is like some super over the top conan novel but the last third felt more darkly humorous as if the characters had wandered into time bandits or labyrinth or something the main problem in my opinion is that at the start you really get to know the main hero but once the central plot gets going there seems to be a change in style and the reader gets pushed away i never really felt connected to the p
6178,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,a very simple formulaic fantasy read nothing really surprising happens and actually the whole book is very predictable the main character is at odds with his cousin and the book centres around their feud and of course a girl and some magic swords it was ok nothing amazing not sure that i would read anymore in the series
6180,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,the story of elric was the first i read of michael moorcock s works it was also the first time i was introduced to the concept of law and chaos and their associated gods this is fantasy on a level so objectively different to the standard that tolkein created with middle earth yet just as powerful in its own right moorcock has created a multiverse that is so interconnected that i doubt you can find any of his works that do not have some form of relationship to another in this case it is elri
6181,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,a lavish dark and pulpy fantasy that i regret not having read earlier short sweet evocative 
6182,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,elric s thoughts brooding and doubts are exquisite even better than the fast paced storytelling and tight if a bit over the top writing 
6183,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,i have been hearing people talk about this series for years and have wanted to read it just listened to the audio and i have to agree it is a good book i am sure i would have liked it more if i had read it all those years ago though it is a good yet simple plot more for the younger readers but still enjoyable for an old guy like me i would rate it num num/num stars but i cant so rounded up this would be a great introduction to fantasy for the kids much better than my first fantasy series thomas
6184,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3, we are victims cousin of a conspiracy a game played by gods demons and sentient swords warning spoilers below i read this one because i had heard it s supposed to be like the literary successor to another book i read called the sword of welleran and i really liked that one this one is like the sword of welleran s moody younger brother not too moody you know but still through the whole thing there s these little forshadowing moments where the narrator hints that things aren t goi
6185,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,a classic of fantasy as influential as tolkien s the lord of the rings and howard s conan this sets everything up for the series to come which will ultimately bring the eternal champion cycle to a conclusion moorcok writes fast the pace zipping along as our melancholy protagonist struggles with alien feelings and his responsibilities before putting the latter aside to follow his destiny and so save his kingdom 
6186,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,being a fan of genre fiction is not easy you have expectations that are set against you right from the start and it is easy to understand why explaining to people why someone like moorcock is good not an easy task especially once you get into the bit about summoning demons and dragons people turn off around then and it isn t hard to see why there is a large culture in the fantasy community of people that argue about who is stronger than who and what this spell would do in this situation if
6187,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,heroic fantasy has never been high on my reading list but i have read some of moorcock s science fiction and liked it and i read one of the hard to classify jerry cornelius books and liked it and so i decided to dive into this best known of his series based on the first three i have read these are not radical reinventions or deconstructions of the genre but they are swiftly and well told stories with a complex hero fantastic settings and cool monsters in other words i am pleased so far
6189,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,elric as a character is sublime pure and simple as a member of an old and jaded race he is seemingly the only one of all his subjects as elric is an emperor to have any semblance of human decency he sits upon a throne carved out of a single monstrous ruby though he does so not because he himself wishes such extravagance indeed he would doubtlessly give up not only the garish object that is the throne but also the empire that it represents if only there was someone to whom he could abdi
6190,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,the most melodramatic and ridiculous fantasy i can ever remember reading i read this on my nook but i could still smell the pulp moorcock paints the world purple and produces more cheese than most french provinces it s a classic though there probably wouldn t be any warhammer or drow without elric allow me to leave you with this excerpt from the book it should give you a perfect idea of what you re going to encounter here the light of the early morning touched the tall towers of imrryr a
6191,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,that was a helluva lot of fun elric is considered moorcock s most famous avatar of his eternal champion theme i can t really explain it without sounding insane just read the wikipedia article if you re curious https //en m wikipedia org/wiki/etern to say moorcock was prolific is putting it mildly i was in a massive used bookstore today and he took up almost two rows himself in the fantasy paperbacks apparently the universes he spins in different novels and trilogies layer in on t
6192,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,at this point i feel like i ve read a pretty good deal of fantasy but i ve come to realize that my experience with the genre does not extend back very far yes i ve read the lord of the rings a wizard of earthsea and most of the amber series but other than those most of the novels i ve read have been pretty recent as such i ve wanted to dip my toes into some older works for awhile now and a chance stop at a local bookshop gave me the perfect opportunity i found a used copy of the first
6193,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,after the disappointment that was stormbringer i did want to give this series a fair shake and try reading it from the chronological start i decided to read this in parallel with the two graphic novels that cover this book s story michael moorcock s elric vol num the ruby throne and michael moorcock s elric vol num stormbringer end result i continue to recommend the graphic novels over the books although elric of melnibone was a far more compelling read than stormbringer the prose and plo
6194,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,oh dear my window of opportunity for thrilling to this book might have closed many years ago so many authors i love have sung its praises and so many friends including my one true love have adored it that i just had to pick it up the writing is sketchy at best moorcock might have acknowledged brecht s threepenny opera as an inspiration but the book is a drug fueled pastiche seriously you can call them wizardly potions but when they cause strange invincibility glassy eyed jitters 
6195,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,i m not sure what to make of elric yet i wasn t a fan for the first half of the book at the start elric is the greatest sorcerer in the world and the second greatest swordsman he s already emperor and the gods answer his calls for help that s just a little too high fantasy for me i don t need everything to be epic in fact i resent a story that s too epic it s harder to relate to it he doesn t have much character yet either elric is less of a douche than the other melnibonean s and spe
6196,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,2,the elric saga is on my classics to read list i e it s a must read whether i like it or not i think it was a bad idea to read a translation for this one main reason translation age more quickly than originals this one is something like twenty years old and the whole series could do with a brand new french makeover of course perhaps the original book has aged as well not having read it i can t really comment on that what i can say is that heroic fantasy is not my favorite fantasy subge
6197,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,1,elric is an emperor of melniboné an island nation that celebrates debauchery and torture physically weak and dependent on herbal remedies to keep his health elric is an odd choice for emperor and he is also albino and red eyed melniboné ruled the world for thousands of years and has only recently fallen from grace and elric would like to change that but his morals and ideas still horrid by human standards but kinder than most of his race are considered bizarre by others his cousin yyr
6198,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,2,i read this and the original elric novels at approximately age num when i still read sci fi and fantasy and wandered through my library s adult and young adult collections reading whatever looked interesting this short novel and its sequels are pagan gothic sci fi/fantasy about the adventures of an outcast former emperor who becomes the servant of a chaos god and travels the world and eventually the multiverse fighting battles this first novel serves mainly to introduce the character and set
6199,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,elric was goth before there was goth what if we put a pallid pensive king in charge of a brutal and entirely physical kingdom he s kind of moody and a bit reluctant about just about everything but his character works in contrast to the hedonistic draconian society that he is supposed to be ruling remarkably we get to see growth and development of the elric which is more than i was expecting in a punchy high concept fantasy novella moorcock doesn t want to waste time which i apprec
6200,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,this was a nice short book i really wish the author had not so loudly criticized tolkien and set this book up as a contrast it really is not even in the same ballpark as tolkien s accomplishments the one thing i will grant him is that his main character elric is conflicted about what exactly constitutes right and wrong and though i would never call that a virtue it does make elric interesting at least the melniboneans however are a very poorly conceived and poorly developed people 
6201,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,a fine start to the cycle but not on a level with the benchmarks lotr or game of thrones potentially on par with leguin s earthsea cycle although my impression so far is that she s a better writer i like that elric starts out as a conflicted character torn between brutal tradition and moral doubts he s no super hero physically weak he only survived infancy due to healing magic each day he needs to take drugs to cleanse his poisoned blood those were the num s when an addict could be an elev
6202,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,this book goes fast it s fun and sometimes surreal and hints at a huge world with rich lore and so on elric of melnibone is the emperor of the most powerful people on the planet and happens to be the most powerful man on the planet which makes this interesting to read for various reasons one being that i ve never read anything with an overpowered hero his downside is that he has a terminal disease that he staves off with drugs so he s basically a drug addict sorcerer emperor who s also a gr
6203,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,spoiler alert not only was this book every bit as awesome as i remember from when i was num i was able to appreciate its racist psycho sexual allegory in ways i did not at such a tender age elric who is literally the whitest man in the world is weak and has no mojo he must take drugs to keep up his strength in order to regain his mojo he has to go and claim a giant black phallic symbol after which he will become extremely potent in order to lay hands on the sword stormbringer the
6204,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,first book of the new year i liked it fine but i think i m a bit too num for it having expected something a bit more ironic the opening pages veer dangerously close to self parody especially for anyone who s read anything by robert e howard it took me a chapter to get into the right frame of mind once i was there though i was hooked elric has been much parodied fiction that takes itself so seriously lends itself very well to satire and i think these parodies haunted my conscience a
6205,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,elric of melniboné is a brief dense and exciting story introducing the reader to the history of the once great empire of melniboné as well as its emperor elric and following the story of the first of his conflicts with unenlightened cousin yyrkoon this story sets up for the eight elric books which follow it of which five following this one make up the original series this book introduces character staples from the series such as dyvim tvar rackhir the red archer and cymoril all of wh
6206,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,i was afraid elric would be in the same prototype as conan loud spitting one liners to give hard ons to num s leonidas and well stupid thankfully i was glad to find that elric is a ruler more prone to think besides himself and empathic to others and has the eye focused on the bigger picture a true brooding dude not bad for a first book of a series but i m expecting the rest to get much better moorcock is not much for expanding details but there s no doubt that the series it s original darke
6207,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,in a world where no one feels guilt or compassion there lives one man that is different from the rest melniboneans are known for doing only what pleases them with no regard for the feelings of others they have their rules and customs but basic human emotions are foreign to them the one man that stands apart just so happens to be the emperor elric elric must choose between his budding feelings and ruling the way the people demand his throne will be challenged but the questions remains 
6208,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,elric the ruler of melnibone contends with the evil yyrkoon for possession of the throne what gives this novel its place in fantasy history is the groundbreaking introduction of the anti hero to sword and sorcery elric comes from a cruel people and has no compunctions about employing torture to further his ends although he does have a fatal fascination for conventional ideas of morality unfortunately michael moorcock is not a very good stylist perhaps because he was writing in the vein of
6209,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,although it is difficult to grasp moorcock s descriptive tones this book invigorated my love of fantasy elric is the anti hero or pseudo hero or whatever you want to call it that i love to see in a character the setting is amazing the adventure is tumultuous and exciting once i started reading this book i fell in love with everything about it definitely looking forward to finishing this series 
6210,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,elric of melniboné is one of those books that i should have read ages ago i always heard that elric was some sort of anti hero and i didn t want to read about bastards doing bastardly things i have enough of that in real life right however at least in this book elric is the nicest guy in melniboné which isn t saying much but seriously he s a likable character that i actually felt sorry for the striking thing about this book is that it is sword sorcery stuff but minus all the ov
6211,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,classic fantasy from the num s it s fun to go back and read the old books that inspired the stories of today this one is pretty straightforward the hero is weak physically but powerful in other ways he s trying to stand up to the long held beliefs or lack thereof within his society also there are sentient swords and he s some kind of albino also at num pages it s kind of a nice change of pace from the giant volumes that are more popular now there isn t room for a ton of depth but the p
6212,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,2,it kills me that something so cool contains the casual unintentional misogyny that this book does often right on the heels of something magnificent it wouldn t kill me so much if it wasn t so undeniably original captivating and occasionally awe inducing though that pretty much comes with the sword and sorcery territory and all too often the greater fantasy category and much of speculative fiction as a whole i must admit i m disappointed the two star rating is because elric of melnibone h
6213,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,i think i had too much oestrogen in my body to like this book it read like lord dunsany but without the magic it was look i m creating a world and it will be magnificent and have flying boats and sword fights and magic and stuff but it felt like the log from someone s d d campaign elric was a terrible gary stu i didn t associate with any of the characters and i found the story itself boring i didn t like the prose or the narrative voice in fact i found myself hoping that melnibone migh
6214,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,moorcock is a capable writer technically one of the difficulties i had was trying to figure out if the dialogue was cliche because he was one of the epic fantasy forefathers or if the language was already tired when he wrote it in the nums either way the dialogue is bad and there is almost no actual adventuring which is what i was looking forward to we are basically given an outline of events and the reader is not allowed along for the ride i feel like moorcock just wrote the important p
6215,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,2,i just don t understand how novels like this have a following there is nothing to them the plot is linear the characters are flat and the novel itself is slow moving despite the fact that it is only num pages this had the potential of becoming something so much more and moving beyond the cliche and often times contrived sci fi/fantasy writing that has plagued the genera for so long instead it kept within strict confines that left me bored and not quite understanding what people see in thi
6216,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,its still early to empathize or even understand elric given his eccentricity and actions that seems to stem from impluse his adventure will make you breathless and the swashbuckling fun and then there are brother swords as i read this i see its influence on many modern fantasy writers the moment i read the sword has a brother i immediately thought of voldemort and hp there is a mirror that shows memories it goes on the story may seem very bleak and superficial as moorcock keeps the flow
6217,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,still on of my favorite fantasy series ever simple yet enticing with an anti hero elric the likes of which has never been equaled and the books tended to only got better through the series until it culminated with stormbringer the last of moorcock s original six elric books some of which were really shorter stories bound into one book in recent decades he s gone back and written other elric novels most of which failed to capture any of the magic the originals did sometimes 
6218,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,i have no idea why i read this series who gave me the idea i must have blocked it out i didn t have any d and d friends so this is weird oh wait a minute i did play a lot of online games i think it was super old school ultima or something like that anyway i thought i was a loner in liking this series but it turns out i have met other really obscure fantasy geeks out there who have read this series too this series has been the source of a lot of my high school paintings and geeky draw
6220,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,this book goes everywhere i m staying at for a while because supposed grown up or no it makes me go purr to be given to teenagers everywhere in place of the usual thoughtless sword swinging high fantasy this is what fantasy should be like in terms of places scenery you just don t get on earth taken as normal by the people who live there a sense of history that doesn t stifle the present with prophesies oh and elves that never refer to themselves as such and would probably offhandedly
6221,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,so i finally got around to reading this one i think maybe its one of those books that was great for its time but doesn t hold up as well today it holds up better than most from that era to my mind but that still leaves room for improvement what i did like was the general since of classic storytelling in that i mean it felt very much like the old myths greek and roman that i read as a kid in the elementary school libraries it kept a sense of wonder and enchantment i m not sure i ll
6222,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,1,man gets theoretically cursed but powerful sword whose powers seem limited to flotation and the medicating diabetes or some similar uncureable ailment he is then cursed to brood so hard even a twilight character would gag sleep with various women who dig that sort of thing and hijinks ensue i guess the book/series would be entertaining as a self referential meta narrative about moorcock doomed by the worst conventions of his genre to spit out endless and endlessly terrible fantasy but probab
6223,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,i devoured the elric series during my university years elric is such a fascinating character the perfect tragic hero forced to carry a sentient vampiric sword i can t tell you how many d d campaigns paid homage to that sword elric led me to moorcock s other novels and barring a few of his latest works i ve read them all jerry cornelius is basically a reworking of the elric character in a mostly contemporary setting so if you like the elric novels you ll like the ones featuring
6224,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,1,the series started mildly interesting i might like some of moorcock s other work but this series became disturbing elric is aligned with the force s of chaos in greek mythology that is higher order but i have seen no fantasy author write of chaos that way this series is about a chaotic person who is against order maybe he begins as more neutral and he is a physically ill person that may be of an ill race but he gets worse 
6226,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,england seems to produce a lot of great fantasy writers michael moorcock carries on that tradition in this book he does something very difficult he creates a truly alien character it s difficult in that how do you create an illogical to us character but which follows its own internal logic the character elric for instance studies the human ideas of guilt and conscience which make no sense to him this book reminds me of greek mythology with a little h p lovecraft thrown in 
6227,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,the first thing by moorcock i ever read at first i had a few problems with the lack of any significant world building on the level of tolkein but moorcock isn’t trying to be as realistic as tolkein instead he is creating straight fantasy i also thought that this was in many ways the kind of thing i imagined as a young child and i’m sorry that i hadn’t discovered elric and moorcock sooner this is elric’s origin story about how he got stormbringer and starts of the whole elric saga 
6228,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,not classic literature but good reading nonetheless i needed this series when i read it as it allowed me an escape the characters were awesome and the story of elric was captivating for those who enjoy fantasy this series is a quick read each book is relatively short and the writing is such that you can sail through the stories i did tire of moorhead s writing style once i was through this series 
6229,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,2,a far cry from the later more complex moorcock this book underwhelmed me while an interesting example of trope/cliche creation for the fantasy genre the story itself is rather dull and predictable no complexity no unforeseen twists and very one dimensional characters a simple quest tale elric finds himself going from one obstacle or battle to the next and overcoming them either through sorcery or the help of demon gods yawn inducing truly 
6230,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,fantastic no pun intended ok maybe a little although this is genre fiction the thematic elements that define elric as a hero and/or anti hero are as timeless as those of the best and most complex mythological figures and the scope of moorcock s story reaches to the end of time and beyond 
6231,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,i read the elric books as a teenager i think i was fascinated by elric and his utter misery he s dependent on the devastation that he wreaks yet he s also thoroughly repelled by it however it may be one of those teenage things that you grow out of like being a goth i m not sure what i d make of the series if i re read it 
6232,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,a story of a fantasy anti hero on a quest to break out of the confines of conan and tolkien yet doomed to failure i m sympathetic to many who don t like this series for myself i find this book s start intriguing and evocative but the end disappointing as it basically comes down to two macho warriors swinging their penises um swords at each other 
6233,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,heard of moorcock through a recommendation from his pal alan moore elric is a demon summoning drug addled albino emperor with a constantly shifting existential moral compass what more could you ask for from a fantasy series i m sure i ll definitely get round to reading the rest of these books at some point this year whole load of fun 
6234,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,yes i seem to be in something of a science fiction/fantasy pattern in recent reading nostalgic entertaining moorcock brings back the excitement of the sf/fantasy of the num s and num s when it took on literary techniques and dark themes from the culture this reminds me of how much i enjoyed the first few books in roger zelazny s amber series and there s a lot more elric to read 
6235,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,this is the first of the series featuring the brooding albino norse hero probably even more captivating than elric is his sword stormbringer which swallows the souls of its victims i ve read the first three novels so far and it s a series i like to have to fall back on when i feel like good hard fantasy 
6236,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,great story not too sure about the stylistics though moorcock manages to stear clear of too many mock archaisms but there is something a little flat about his prose will definitely read the next installment 
6237,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,original and interesting the main character is awesome and the world and the atmosphere are very weird and unlike other fantasy stories the plot is not focused enough for my taste and that s why i give it num instead of num stars still i reccomend the book for fantasy fans young and old 
6238,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,more of an outline for a novel than an actual novel with a hyper simplistic storyline unfettered by depth of character or description moorcock used to brag about how many words he could pound out in a day and it shows here num num stars 
6239,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,2,this book started out strong but got boring around the middle it is still some of the better swords and sorcery i have read but sword and sorcery stories just feel so derivative to me and been there done that num stars it was ok 
6240,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,probably the best know of the eternal champion incarnations elric is a tragic figure enough to make an ancient greek weep with joy great fantasy epic not your tolkien style story very good plots and characters highly recommended 
6241,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,old fashioned sword and sorcery a quick and easy read well written good character development for the protagonist is old one can see where many new authors are taking inspiration from num/num higher rating because of it being very old 
6242,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,what an rpg what an epic series this book is simply in its storytelling but always grips you let your mind wander an fall in love with elric viii this is the greatest dark fantasy of all times 
6243,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,2,i tried to like this book but i just couldn t it struck me as being a rather immature story like it was written by a thirteen year old boy really not a lot of character depth or creativity i will try another moorcock book because i heard he was supposed to be really good 
6244,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,on of the classics that has had a profound influence on fantasy but doesn t get much attention really creative fantasy about a villain turned hero sort of and of course he also has an awesome sword it s been a long time since i read it so memory is fuzzy but i remember really liking it 
6245,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,2,uff how many times did your cousin betray you in the past num num times so you re gonna go wandering and leave him back home as king with your love interest sure how could that ever go wrong i m sorry but i just can t follow the logic of the characters 
6246,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,i can t believe it s taken me so long to read an elric book growing up raistlin was my go to frail magic minded demi god of choice but now i m in the elric camp and at under num pages a volume these books go down much easier than the swollen epic fantasy of today 
6248,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,wonderfully inventive and surreal it s not hard to see why this is a cult classic moorcock s prose is a pleasure to read and his characters are vivid and memorable 
6249,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,i will re read this book in the future and then i will make a proper review
6250,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,vintage sword and sorcery relative to which modern offerings pale by comparison almost as if thier souls are being sucked out of them through gaping ghastly wounds 
6251,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,as brian mentions it s hard to imagine enjoying this one today but once upon a time the albino warrior and his duplicitous stormbringer were trusted friends 
6252,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,4,i literally threw this book across the room the first time i tried to read it the second time i laughed at it the third time i was addicted to it 
6253,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,2,aye a classic in the genre aye full of awkward dialogue and nonsensical motivations aye moorcock has some gall criticizing tolkien if this is his counterexample 
6254,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,i fell in love with this novel as a teen and have loved moorcock ever since a recent re read showed me he s still the best this is what fantasy should be like 
6255,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,this book is just amazing sword and sorcery protagonist with deep angst and ballad like story telling i can still remember why i liked it so much num years ago 
6256,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,3,not sure if i would still like it but have very fond memories of this one from numth grade had to put it in here for todd 
6257,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,5,this series was perhaps what made me a full fledged reader of sci fi / fantasy novels i d already read some books such as tolkein but this series surppased them all for me

6290,Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,2,elric of melnibone is a fantasy novel written by michael moorcock that involves the emperor of melnibone elric embarking on a quest to rescue cymoril his close friend and romantic interest i dislike this book it lost my interest after the first book this book is divided into two books and felt too much like any other story about rescuing a princess from the antagonist i could predict events coming up and i felt no attachment to any characters the villain of the story yykroon elric s cous

6294,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,very nice book for everyone who is a fan of artemis fowl i think the two stories in this book were better than the later books in the series they are very funny and are written in the no nonsense adventurous way of the first books before things started to take a more serious tone 
6295,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,2,this was a book that i liked on my first reading but loathed very certainly upon my second or third the two year gap might explain a bit the two star rating instead of a one is mainly because the stories included are very good i find no flaws with them and i ve picked up the book to re read them several times but the trivia questions extras and basically everything else are annoying and badly written it always seems to me that the major flaw of writers particularly in the young adult
6296,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,was a good reminder of old artemis days and the story suits well for a lazy reading day eoin calfer’s humor is the best 
6297,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,a companion book to the artemis fowl series the book contains two short stories leprecon describes holly s initiation from traffic duty to recon seventh dwarf follows mulch diggums my favorite artemis fowl character as he and artemis team up to steal a famous tiara the rest of the book is comprised of notes from artemis fowl s files on the fairy folk the fairy code and a key to decode it and interviews with the main charactersare the highlights entertaining

6299,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,this is a fun addition to the artemis fowl canon along with character interviews and a catalog of some of foaly s inventions there are two short stories leprecon the story of how holly got into recon in the first place is a good solid story believable plot believable in this universe of fairies and whatnot good villain typical rule breaking holly shenanigans the seventh dwarf is fun but it feels more like filler than anything else granted eoin colfer filler is pretty good fill

6301,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,i thought the interviews and faerie descriptions were a little contrived but the short stories themselves were wonderful how else would holly earn a spot in leprecon without breaking a few rules as she always does how else would mulch and artemis grow to be friends if they weren t pulling off a few heists behind the backs of the lep 
6302,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,in true artemis fowl series fashion i wasn t sure who to root for in the short stories it was strange to read stories for between books num and num just because you have to remember everyone still hates everyone whoever had this book before me was considerate enough to use pencil in the crosswords 
6303,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,i love how for all his brilliance and criminal activity artemis fowl is firstly and lastly a little boy who loves his mother i liked both of the short stories that were included in this book we get to read a prequel short story about holly s initiation and a sequel story in which mulch diggums makes a reappearance the physical anatomy of a dwarf is very intriguing to me 
6304,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,four stars on the cute short stories that give you a little background a peek into some unseen time during the artemis fowl world the interviews i give three stars several of them i liked but for some reason the one with foaly rubbed me the wrong way i know self centered but wow i didn t realize how bad i would have hated his character had i read his interview before the books

6310,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,this was such a fun read “the first female in recon ” groaned the commander holly lowered her face to hide a grin that she couldn’t contain “you’re going to wash out in six months ” continued root “and probably cost me a fortune ” he was wrong about the first but right about the second ” my admiration for captain holly short grew fonder after reading leprecon additionally it was such a nice short story as it challenges the characters s morale and motives especially commander julius r
6311,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,the artemis fowl files makes for a fun little addition to the series which really does fit better as book num num than something to read at the end of the series which is what i did but then it is always nice seeing familiar faces we haven’t seen in a long time too holly s initiation to leprecon made for a good story and the end definitely had me laughing out loud it s so holly it also made for a better introduction of turnball root julius root’s brother so he does not come so out o

6313,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,i expected it to be more boring than what it was but especially holly s story was really interesting to read through as it depicts how she got into recon and establishes her past solidly mulch s story on the other hand was a bit too fast and it did not have the same tension but fun and heartwarming nonetheless the contents are not that amazing apart from the num stories there is information artemis has gathered but it seems way too specific to be useful like basing the traits of an entire r
6314,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,this is half activity book and half short stories i had actually never read these before but it was kind of cute going back to when they didn t all work together as a cohesive unit after reading further into the book series i wish i had read it before the seventh book but too late now still it was a fun and easy read i d give it four stars

6335,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,2,artemis fowl files is an ancillary book in the artemis fowl octet written by the irish author eoin colfer it was released during the gap between the release of artemis fowl and the eternity code and artemis fowl and the opal deception it contains interviews some puzzles the gnommish script decoder interviews with the characters and the better part of the whole thing two short stories one of them is an event that takes place before the start of the series which is holly short’s promotion

6338,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,the artemis fowl files this book was very interesting to say the least i was a bit skeptical in the beginning mainly because i’m not a big fan of books that have fairies and magic in it but this book changed my view on that opinion what kept me reading this book was that i was always wondering what was going to happen next the story kept me on my toes from the very start you never knew what was going to happen the plot of the story probably wasn’t the greatest because it was very simple b
6340,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,actual rating is num num i would highly recommend reading this book after reading artemis fowl and the arctic incident because there are massive spoilers for both of those books in this one it s not necessary to read this book to understand the others but it s good for clarification and information if you re curious or the type of fan who has to know the details or enjoys the details the reading level is definitely middle school level and this book only has two stories leprecon which gives the
6342,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,the book which is only about num pages is mostly made up of the two shorts stories one called leprecon the story of captain holly short s move from traffic to recon and how she became the first female officer to serve under commander julius root and the other is called seventh dwarf leprecon was somewhat of a disappointment the villain who has a very interesting background turns out to be flat in the end and the story was just lacking the usual fowl smartness and edginess the story is
6343,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,the artemis fowl files by eoin colfer was a great short story the book was around num pages but it was a great book to end the story it was a blast from the past there were no spoilers in the book so you could read it if you haven t read the other artemis fowl still i enjoyed reading it last this book was really a blast from the past it has a bunch of little games in it which i personally skipped the reading part was fantastic though there were two short stories one was when holly s
6344,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,this book contains two short stories one about holly and one about mulch apart from the stories there are also a couple of interviews with the main characters some blueprints of fairy technology and several puzzles the stories are great but the puzzles i could have lived without the biggest fault this book has is that its contents can also be found elsewhere in later publications the first story can be found in the time paradox and the second story was published on its own as the seventh

6347,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,i recently had the honor of reading “the artemis fowl files” it was amazing and descriptive the artemis fowl files which was written by eoin colfer took place mostly every where this book is action packed and still lies a mystery even i can’t figure out any ways this book was mainly about children trying to figure out about ancient cultures which still were not reveled i think this was mostly to do with the captains and commander the main characters were holly and root this book is al
6348,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,as an avid artemisian it s hard to believe that i hadn t read this yet it was quite interesting too i think i liked the first story more than the second but the history side of things is often underplayed in the main sequence so worked well here this sort of tie in gets lost when you listen to audio books a real shame as nathaniel parker who narrates the unabridged novels does so with such aplomb it would have been nice if leprecon had been included as an audio bonus with the opal decept
6349,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,not really sure how to review this book it has two short stories in it – that sandwich some other pap which are character profiles and interviews with characters i’d seen mention to the second story – the eight dwarf – on a website which made me aware of the book i must say that while i’m writing this – i have no recollection what the first story was about – which either sums up my memory or shows that the story wasn’t particularly memorable i didn’t really enjoy the supplementary material 
6350,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,the artemis fowl files by eoin colfer is a great book with two short stories one is about lep recon captin holly short s initiation into lep recon and the other one is about a familiar dwarf mulch diggums and artemis fowl going after lady fei fei s tiara also there is some puzzles crosswords interviews of people you meet thoughout the series and information on some of foaly s gadets the stories may be short but they are great stories the interveiws and information on some of foaly s ga

6352,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,i got this book when i was about ten and going to france for a holiday it was brilliant it could have been a bit longer that s the only thing and if you got the seventh dwarf when it was a world book day book you might be a bit disappointed to see it s one of the two stories advertised but i didn t have that so i was grand i really loved this book years ago it had loads of extra information on the characters and the world all done with colfer s trademark humour the codes were deadly in

6355,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,these files would have been perfect to read during my post artemis blues i suffered a few years back however i did not know of its existence then and had to wallow in my withdrawal in painful silence anyway the files are great for fowl fans as it is full of activities facts about the underworld interviews w/the main characters and num short stories that give a little more history than the num book series the fairy code is also supplied i tried cracking that way back when i read the first b

6357,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,i enjoyed the short stories they were well developed the background story of holly short being initiated into the leprecon unit was especially meaningful it further deepens the overall relationships in the artemis fowl world i loved the silly interviews “what keeps you awake at night ” part of the answer artemis gives is he sometimes feels bad about the things he has done but gets past the guilt when he checks his bank account balance one of butler’s questions was “what is your favorite bo
6358,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,not really all that important to the core series it would have been better if there were some tidbits that would pop up later in the series but honestly it feels like it was written as an after thought or just random loose end story ideas that never developed into anything i did like hollys story as a prequel but the seventh dwarf although fun just seemed kinda an obsolete story in the long run i actually would have loved it if holly wasn t involved in that story and the little heist was b
6359,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,this is a great addition to the fowl series there are two full stories here holly short s initiation into leprecon and mulch and artemis s first job together there are also interviews with characters and with the author plans for foaly s inventions and some other extras and simple activities for readers the full stories add strong detail to the main story the first one clarifies who turnball root is exactly how crazy he is and why he has such a grudge against holly and his brother it
6360,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,an excellent companion book to the artemis fowl series although it s entirely supplementary in a weird way i think this was my favourite book of the series you definitely can t appreciate it without having read the others but i found it was the one that i had the longest lasting affection for this book is pretty much what you d expect containing notes diagrams and maps relating to the series along with a couple short stories about the characters other adventures the short stories are pr
6361,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,the stories were great fun awesome as usual even though the last one could never really happen the rest of the book was boring crosswords find a words codes which i admit weren t so bad interviews species biographies and diagrams the interviews were nothing special the biographies only revolve around one particular character e g centaur foaly elf holly the diagrams are also pretty uninteresting except for one which explains how to get above ground how the whole flare thing wor
6362,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,review from my numst reading just dipped into it a second time the artemis fowl files does exactly what it s supposed to do–a yummy snack while we wait for the last artemis fowl book i must admit that i did not enjoy the interviews and other activities as much as i enjoyed the two short stories however i can see how readers who love the fairy world even more than i do could find the interviews and other activities quite fun the two short stories are excellent and would earn a five star rat
6363,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,the fowl files includes a short story on how captain short became part of leprecon and a short story written for world book day set in between book num and num featuring a jewel heist collaboration between fowl and the dwarf diggums it also features interviews with the principal characters descriptions of the many different races within the people technical files on the equipment lep operatives use to capture and apprehend fugitives and an interview with eoin colfer the writer of the fowl series
6364,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,this was a really cool book to read if you are an artemis fowl fan it contains a few short stories which lend a background understanding to some of the characters and an amazing key to the fairy language i immediately used it to read the inscriptions on the bottom of each of the books i know im a nerd it was really fun i dont know if the code was colfer s idea or his editor but that little code elevated the books to something more than a story for me it became a real puzzle and enga
6365,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,this collection of various additional materials about the world of artemis fowl is only made worthwhile by the addition of two short stories one about holly short s history in joining leprecon and the other about a caper envisioned by artemis set immediately after the first book i think this may have worked better if i had read it after the first book as i was surprised to see the return of the criminal artemis as opposed to the robin hood character he has become over the past num books but
6366,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,as for short inbetweener stories this pair were a reasonable set to read in the first one i enjoyed the little bit of a backstory on the people it seemed amusing to have a little bit of the story behind holly trouble and even julius root in the seventh dwarf i liked the growing escapades between artemis and mulch diggums the ending was a lovely touch and was rather happy as for the final notes and interviews of the characters i liked the insight to each characters lives the little qu

6368,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,this book almost didn t even need to be published its only real interesting parts were holly s initiation and the interviews everything was rather unsurprising we already knew everything just restated from earlier published books and the fairy code was only for those who couldn t figure it out already or were too lazy to and mulch s story added nothing really it wasn t like mulch lacked presence in previous or coming novels and the story gave no new information it felt like a silly activ
6369,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,basically the official fowl field guide the artemis fowl files is a must read for any artemis fan not only including bonus material it contains two short stories the first story is about corporal short s raise to captain the second is an operation involving a fei fei tiara seven drawfs and a criminal boy genius plus the back up of billions of dollars worth in fairy technology bonus material includes a fairy field guide character interviews artemis report card a gnommish translator a
6370,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,i ve listened to all the bowl books i don t think there s an audiobook of this one it really wouldn t work as one it s a short quick read about num pages or so if you ve read the series or listened to it as i have it adds some background info about a few characters but it really kinda feels more like info that was simply left out of the other books at some point in time and then discovered laying around in an old file slapped into a new book and published if you re a fan of arty and the
6371,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,two short stories one is before the first book and the second one is after the first book neither takes away from reading the first artemis is a criminal mastermind genius science geek rich and only num years old he is the anti harry potter somehow i feel though he s not all that bad i ve already began reading the first book as a friend at work and i are both reading these stories its fun to read the same book as someone you know this is a ya/teen book but it is very much a fun read 
6372,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,2,this book was okay i didn t exactly dislike it but i didn t really like it too much either it s been a few years since i read my last artemis fowl book and to be honest i don t really remember a whole lot about them i feel like the books in general are not memorable for me i know i had fun reading them and i know i mostly liked the characters but the books really aren t anything special this one had two very short stories the stories didn t draw me in i mostly just kept reading to ge
6373,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,two short stories show how holly became a lep officer and follows one of artemis s schemes along with interviews with the characters these stories serve as bonus material and definitely shouldn t be read unless otherwise familiar with the series but they do examine two of the characters and shed some light on their characters holly is the only female lep officer and it was an uphill climb to get there her story showed how her quick thinking and ingenuity got her her place the other story
6374,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,i bought this book because of the cover and because artemis is my internet alter ego i m not being absolutely true i bought artemis fowl the first book of the series because i liked this books cover i still love to play with the magnet that runs along the fold the short stories are nice but i don t really see them fit in the other books chronology but they are nice back stories and they fit the characters well the rest of the stuff in the book is already available on the internet page and
6375,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,i m so glad that i found another artemis fowl book to read i was so sad when i finished the last one but then i found out about this one and the num graphic novels i ll have to get my hands on those this book was great it has two short stories as well as descriptions of all the fairies interviews with the main characters and a key to the gnommish language now i can decode the messages in all the other books which i am trying to collect so i can own them and read them over and over and ov
6376,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,i picked up this for a short fun read and it certainly was the first line had me laughing it was great to get back into the world of holly short and artimis fowl and remember all the other hilarious things they did this book had two short stories in it and some other amusing interviews and bits and pieces you will definitely want to have read at least the first book before reading this one otherwise there would be big spoilers i have no problem with the content in this book at all mostly
6377,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,this was a very quick read as it s num short stories and some game type stuff i d describe it as basically an activity book with two short stories and a few page or two long interviews as well as a few pages describing the faerie creatures i enjoyed both the short stories immensely the first one has to do with how holly moved up from traffic to recon as well as what commander root s brother did and how he wound up in jail it was a pretty great story to read the second story was a heist story
6378,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,i enjoyed this story or rather num short stories and it reminded me of how much i enjoyed the artemis fowl series as a whole interesting characters and an imaginative plot with all the fairy technology etc in terms of added extras in this book they seemed a bit young for me but entertaining none the less i loved the character interviews especially the one of artemis fowl it was plausible for his character and quiet funny 
6379,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,a nice little taste for fans of artemis fowl the short stories are both solid well paced and without the overstrained humor that plagued some of the later books in the series the other content is kind of hit or miss i appreciated the illustrations of the pod and helmet but i could have mostly done without the interviews except for butler s not particularly substantial but a fun little extra 
6380,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,2,this is basically just an artemis fowl add on though worth a read if you re a fan of the series you can usually find it in bargain bins or for cheap online it s got character bios and interviews as well as some short stories and a few puzzles there was a crossword in there i think all dedicated to the fowl verse not bad really but not appropriate for someone who wants something with real plot and action 
6381,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,i loved this book the artemis fowl files was one of the best books i have read the book was about how holly short was a corporal and she was trying to become a recon until these one elvs kidnapped her and others who were going to the test to see if she had what it takes to be a recon but then they said if you try to run away we will hurt and maybe kill one of your friends the only way holly and her friends were going to escape is if her boss gave them a ton of num carat gold jewlery 
6382,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,a fun little book written between the eternity code and the opal deception it explains all about the elves includes interviews with the key players and especially nice gives the key to the elvish alphabet so you can decode all the elvish writing on the pages of the artemis fowl books several short stories are included we find out how holly got her acorns and have a bit of fun with mulch diggums 
6383,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,2,the first short story is really good it tells the story of how holly got to be the first female lep officer ever it s a num stars story the second story it has to much artemis and i just don t like artemis i can see that he will probably get better but right now he s just a little know it all or so he thinks it s a num num stars story the interviews are just to fill some space in the book so they re a num num stars 
6384,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,this book is part stories part artemis fowl universe info inside you get the fairy alphabet which kinda made me sad because i liked that i decoded it without help some guides to the different races of fairies and some other odds and ends plus little one shot stories about the characters you know and love want to know how holly basically got into recon on a bet it s a hilarious story and i love holly so much 
6385,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,this is a cool field guide to artemis fowl and i enjoyed it i was personally annoyed that they included the decoded fairy language as my friend and i spent several hours decoding the fairy code using the actual code and the translation then translating the entire bottom of the first book it was painstaking but worth it and it bothers me that other people can do the exact same thing by looking at a couple of page in that book otherwise a fun read if you have enjoyed artemis fowl 
6386,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,i liked the short stories and the extras such as artemis s report card and the fairy language the reader gets a better understanding of the characters which is always good because the stories take place in normal situations it does have the main problem of a supplementary book in that much of the information is not new and is just pulled straight from the series luckily there s not too much of it 
6387,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,2,i ve liked all of the artemis fowl books but this companion piece didn t feel like an artemis fowl story i enjoyed the seventh dwarf mainly because mulch diggums is always entertaining everything else felt flat and forced however the interviews the diagrams it wasn t anything that couldn t be included in or explained by one of the main stories i d much rather have a new artemis fowl book to read 
6388,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,if you are an artemis fowl fan or simple read the artemis fowl series you may want to pick up this book it is a nice companion to all the great artemis fowl books and gives us in depth files of each of the characters in artemis fowl pick it up if you wish for more of an insight on the characters backgrounds 
6389,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,i think this book was a good one because this book was about all kinds of action and fairy tales this book was great about many other things like how the monsters and other fairy tales charaters were in the in hole story all of the monsters are after a code to unlock something like a door way or something else like other monsters and other fairy tales 
6390,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,2,nice background info on holly and mulch the true gem in this collection is artemis school report he choses alternate days to give wrong answers to teach his teachers about chaos theory lol on the other end of the spectum the interviews with the characters were just so painfully stereotypical i m clearly too old for this stuff now 
6391,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,2,i didn t like it much because of the seventh dwarf the stories in it are quite good but eoin colfer missed a spot the seventh dwarf takes place between the artic incident and the first book and yet the dialogue in the artic incident clashes with what is written in the artemis fowl files and basically ruined it for me 
6392,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,if you have read artemis fowl series and you have some questions in your mind this book can answer them it has num new but short stories in it and also a lot of other texts i really liked this book my favorite short story in this book is the seventh dwarf i also liked the interviews and foaly s inventions 
6393,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,have you ever wanted to be able to read a symbolic language besides the short stories which are so much fun for a quick read i really loved getting the codes for the language translation at the bottom of each artemis fowl book is another story written in one of the fairy languages the artemis fowl files will help you translate it really great for kids of all ages 
6394,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,this was more of a short stories and stat book than anything else i found the character interview section hilarious by far butler and mulch diggums are my favorite characters in the series with holly and artemis in a tied second these short stories fill in the holes that were left in the story from the third book on cheers and happy reading 
6395,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,2,eoin cofer’s artemis fowl series reminded me how much i love a good fantasy series he sucks the reader in and weaves a story that does not let go making for a non stop reading fest like only a good fantasy novel can supply my only regret is that i only became aware of the series when i had already grown up and had to suffer the weird stares that people give to adults reading ya material 
6396,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,it wasn t quite as fascinating as i was hoping it would be not to mention the what magical race are you quiz or whatever it s called is rigged i couldn t get anything other than human and i was hoping for at least a sprite or centaur c mon but still it s artemis fowl it has a worthy place on my favorites shelf 
6397,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,for an extras book this is downright amazing there s new stuff in it which i don t have to tell you how rare that is in summary two short stories interviews with the main characters artemis s school report the gnommish alphabet and some general info about different aspects of the fairy world my only problem is that i am greedy and want even more stuff 
6398,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,it was wonderful to get some of the back story behind holly and julius encounter with turnball as well as artemis shenanigans with mulch after the whole fairy gold incident there were other interesting profiles in there too and i liked the part with the interviews with the main characters i liked getting the stories not officially told 
6399,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,this is a weird guide to book with some diagrams and interviews with characters and blurbs on the language and whatnot but there are a couple stories in it too the story about holly short s experience in trying out for recon is hilarious and awesome and the extra information is fun did i mention i love this guy 
6400,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,it was so fun to get lost in this world again and learn more about artemis mulch butler holly and everyone else i adore books like this and it was such a fun quick read i wish it had been longer mr colfer has such an imagination and this book was proof of that i would read this again any day it was funny well written and engaging easily num out of num stars 
6401,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,i love artemis fowl i really do although the last book was relatively disappointing i still love the series and this book reminded me of that i admit i mostly skimmed the reference material and i skipped mulch s short story because i don t like him but the other short stories were totally worth it 
6402,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,it was good i read the series a number of years ago and completely enjoyed it it was neat to find this book and get some in between and back stories on the artemis fowl gang and find out some new adventures i didn t like the last half of the book that had the interviews with the characters they didn t seem genuine 
6403,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,gee this might sound creepy i can read gnommish now this book has a code in it for the bottoms and/or covers of the rest of the books that are written in the fairy language carry me always carry me well i am thy teacher of herb and spell i am thy link to power arcane forget me and thy magick shall wane p
6404,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3, num num light hearted easier than the formal books in the series a nice change from the tense and thrilling artemis fowl funny and interesting to read the character interviews normally i dislike these small guides in between a series yet i enjoyed the artemis fowl files i can now learn how to write gnommish 
6405,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,it is so fun reading this series with my son i did not know that this was short stories and i was left wanting we get a glimpse into corporal short’s intro to lep and a short intro to a great villain that just never developed into a climax that i was anticipating it is really hard to review something like this just not sure what to say other than it was enjoyable 
6406,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,2,a frustrating companion to the series that includes some mediocre short stories the stories carry none of the charm or wit of the series and feel loose and oversimplified skip this i haven t bothered to translate the gnommish at the bottom of the pages and read it so i can t speak for that though 
6407,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,the two little stories in the book were cute i like holly s back story best it s just good to know how she became the first female to get in and all that there were some great activities in there for kids and it even has the first alphabet in there for those who didn t work it out when reading the first book 
6408,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,i really enjoyed this book the middle information was cute i didn t really pay to much attention to it but the two short stories really caught my attention they really added to the plot and story of the artemis fowl series and i loved the suspense and surprises they carried the epilogue of the seventh dwarf was just cherry on the cake 
6409,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,overall num num this one is about holly s initiation into lep s recon unit and another short story involving artemis and mulch diggums also carries interviews of all the main characters of this series and characteristics of the various creatures of the fairy world must read for fans of this series 
6410,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,in the short story the numth dwarf set before the artic incident artemis meets mulch contradicting the premise in the artic incident that that was when they first met otherwise an excellent mini adventure as well as the other short story leprecon holly s initiation all the other little extras were cool too 
6411,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,this book includes a couple sections of stories that i think were written for special events or something anyway stories that are like side stories and not found in any of the real books it was a really fast read and i really enjoyed the quick tales i even enjoyed the silly interviews with characters and extras in the book 
6412,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,it won t be interesting if you aren t an artemis fowl fan but i quite enjoyed it since artemis fowl butler holly short and mulch diggums are some of my favorite characters of all time it is the first artemis fowl book that i read rather than listened to and i find i like him in writing just as much as audio book 
6413,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,very short and enlightening read that adds some depth to the artemis fowl series the best parts of this book are the two short stories included in this book the first one is about holly shorts initiation into the lep recon division the second story features artemis fowl and the dwarf mulch teaming up for a jewel heist 
6414,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,the seventh dwarf reminded me of the younger more cunning artemis definitely enjoyed the back story about how holly got her first acorns too bad the notes didn t include descriptions of nonum s species as well a neat companion to the artemis fowl series 
6415,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,the two bonus stories in this book were fun to read i m a big fan of holly short and she was important in both stories there is some helpful info about the difference between fairies pixies dwarfs trolls etc for those who might confuse them sometimes 
6416,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,this must have been written early on in the series i don t think it s worth as much as the eight series books but it was good i liked that it filled in some gaps left from the first couple books kinda weird that it has a word search in the middle 
6417,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,i found this collection after completing the series it was nice to be reminded of several books back in my memory these shorts stories are great vignettes that deepen the characters background and personality honestly i wouldn t mind a collection of more 
6418,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,2,this a complementary book for the artemis fowl series it has two short stories one with holly and the other one with mulch and artemis they are both good but there s nothing special about them read it if you really like those characters 
6419,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,do not read it this book if you didn t finish with the first three books of the artemis series it had crosswords and word search his report card was my favorite part of the book it showed his personality so much it s very interesting so start reading this book 
6420,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,doesn t compare to other books in the series but a good read nonetheless i enjoyed the interviews with the characters and the author at the end funny how opal koboi and other stuff was mentioned a couple of times in there 
6421,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,a cute short story which serves as a prequel to the artemis fowl series it describes how holly short came to be the first female leprecon agent merged review two short stories from the artemis fowl universe 
6422,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,i enjoyed all the extra bits and the short stories but colfer could ve included so much more i ve read other books similar to this one for other series that were much better done overall i m glad i read it and the parts i enjoyed were very good but it could ve been a lot better 
6425,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,it was nice to see a couple of background stories in this book but it sort of peters out when you get to the interview parts it would have been more satisfying to have the miscellaneous parts first 
6426,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,2,in enjoy the artemis fowl series and these were just num short stories which were a fun and a quick read i also liked the book because it had a lot of drawings about certain pieces of fairy technology that were fun to see 
6427,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,a short story about how holly got her job and another about what mulch diggums did after the events of book num both are entertaining enough though neither is necessary there s also some miscellaneous junk of questionable interest 
6428,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,nothing that i hadn t decoded before specifically talking about the gnomish alphabets it is not updated as in with the latest novel the atlantis complex and i say this isn t really a required reading if you re a fan of the fowl series just leaf through it 
6429,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,nice companion book for artemis fowl s series while we waiting impatiently for the final book book num last guardian next year it contains num short stories and tidbits on af series main characters i never can get enough of this series too bad it will end soon 
6430,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,what a great bit of fun if you love the artemis fowl series this is a must read two short stories plus diagrams and illustrations explaining everything you ve wondered about the first short story is a prequel the second short story takes place between the first and second books 
6431,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,i started reading artimus fowl to help brevin my num yr old get in to them i have to say i am really enjoying them they are fun and i think they have some good lessons about integrity and selfishness 
6432,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,num short stories leprecon and the seventh dwarf one about holly becoming the first female in recon and one about mulch diggums working with artemis in between the num stories are some interviews and diagrams 
6433,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,not as interesting as i had hoped the stories are good but again not as good as i was expecting when i ordered it more fun than entertaining some interesting interviews and little games possibly something a huge artemis fowl fan would enjoy really 
6434,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,i love artemis fowl artemis fowl is perfect novel and all i want to tell u just read it to eoin colfer you re great from redharing foever fan s 
6435,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,a clever guide to the artemis fowl books
6436,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,great juvie lit really enjoyed the fun world and characters were a hoot fun read especially good for tween boys but as an adult it was also diverting enough 
6437,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,the stories are the only thing that makes this worth reading they are quick paced and action packed the interviews and whatnot are pointless 
6438,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,good book i read in primary school 
6439,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,yay it has a translation key and the short stories are really good 
6441,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,i love this book almost as much as the actual series of artemis fowl all n all this is another masterpiece of eoin colfer s
6442,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,this was a great book but the activities in it were way easy and the extra stories weren t all that interesting to me good thing was that i learned a new language 
6443,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,a long time i ago i read this remember nearly nothing
6444,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,this is kind of a fun guide to the series you need to have read at least the first book in the series before this one will make any sense 
6445,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,very commercial book fun little stories in it but not very intriguing like the full length books are it is a fun read but not much more than that 
6446,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,short story quick read as opposed to the longer books that were a quick read i guess now i can let z have the kindle back so she can read them herself 
6447,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,interesting collection of stories of the great artemis fowl 
6448,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,i really likes the extra short stories in it 
6449,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,2,also a book to pass some time not bad certainly not great either 
6450,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,it seems to me that this book is meant to be read between the third and fourth books of the artemis fowl series 
6451,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,2,the two short stories were cute not as satisfying as any of the books but cute 
6453,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,an amazing series with great characters the protagonist is very cleverly written a great series i would recommend to anyone 
6454,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,i l o v e d this book i should have probably read this before i finished the series but still it made a fantastic read 
6455,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,i always have this in my bag laughs 
6456,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,when you are hungry for more you turn to whatever you can he brings up many parts of the character lives you would not have had in the books i liked it 
6457,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,3,if you like artemis fowl you will like the stories it contains and the extra information about the fairy people it is a quick little read and fun 
6458,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,4,happy to find the out of print the seventh dwarf in here nice additional materials to go with the first artemis book 
6459,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,this is a fun little book with a few stories like how holly gets into her job it gives more info and is fun 
6460,The Artemis Fowl Files,Eoin Colfer,5,really enjoyed learning how holly became the first female officer

6519,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,jorg ancrath you little fucker my feelings towards jorg and this book can be best described as the epitome of an abusive relationship jorg is not a nice man actually for most of the book he s num years old so fuck the nice man part because he s not even a man yet but he ll rip your head off quite literally if you say that to his face he is a rapist a murderer he tortures he kills haphazardly he is destructive capricious a madman in every sense of the word he will wound you ph

6521,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,2,num num/num stars a lot of reader and fans claimed king of thorns to be the best out of the broken empire trilogy it pained me to do so but i can’t agree with that notion i’m going to inform you right from the beginning of my review there s an innocent dog torture scene in this book and i’ll admit that part was quite tough to read however this doesn’t mean that the scene itself isn’t important to the overarching story there’s a reason behind this scene it’s really well written and in my opinion 
6522,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,nan
6523,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,i think this is my favorite book in an excellent trilogy because the odds are so severely against our anti hero jorg the stakes are high and the plot twists are perfect having killed his uncle and secured a small kingdom in the mountains young jorg now faces a powerful charismatic enemy – the prince of arrow – who seems destined to unite the broken empire the action jumps back in forth in time from the siege of jorg’s capital to several years before showing us how jorg traveled the empir
6524,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5, num/num king of thorns probably the best of all so many feels do you know what i love in these books picture the perfect hero kind skilled supported by all kind of prophecies see this guy the perfect gary sue of fantasy well here you root for the other guy who wants to kill him because jorg is some kind of anti knight in shining armor i don t play by the rules you choose ✿ hello knight in shining armor prophecies see you rule the world because you re the one ♠ and jorg pro
6525,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,1,unpopular opinion time there are some brilliant anti heroes in the realms of fiction anthony burgress’ alex from a clockwork orange and byron’s don juan immediately spring to mind in both cases the characters are undeniably flawed and twisted they exploit the world and other people to meet their own ends they are egotistical bastards with little to no scruples mark lawrence’s jorg ancrath is no different he is a nasty piece of work who lives simply for himself there’s nothing wrong w
6526,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,sometimes the world slows and you notice every small thing as if you stood between two beats of eternity’s heart the air hung heavy with the metallic scent of rain i wondered if i stood out there in the flood would the rain wrap a grey life and make it shine should i stand arms spread and raise my face let it wash me clean or did my stains run too deep err… picks up the jaw from the floor wow this book is in an entirely different league than prince of thorns so many layers s
6527,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,3,originally reviewed at bookwraiths reviews num update after finishing the trilogy in the below review i had many criticisms about the story specifically how jorg seemingly produced super powers out of thin air to save himself while that is exactly how i felt after closing king emperor of thorns satisfactorily explained those aspects of the story so when reading this review please understand many of my criticisms were later made moot by mr lawren
6528,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,as good as the first not quite but i still really liked it the story is told from three points of view jorg s present as he faces a massive army set to destroy him flash back four years as jorg tries to discover the origins of a mysterious copper box that seems to have stolen some of his memories and finally the journal entries of katherine jorg s love interest at times i found this bouncing back and forth confusing but i m pretty sure it was only because of how slowly i was forced to read
6529,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,if you regularly follow my reviews you must have already noticed that nice out of ten times i don t get to enjoy the next installments in a series as much as the first one probably due to the fact that i m already acquainted with the world character building as well as the magic system so i am less impressed by the rest of the story king of thorns is the exception to the rule the one out of ten fifteen i d hardly be fifteen and rousting villages by the time fifteen came around 
6530,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,mark lawrence stormed onto the scene well as much as you can in the publishing world last year with his debut prince of thorns book one in the broken empire this divisive book found a fan in me despite this particular first person point of view that all notions of good and virtue tells you to hate i found a lot of things that i liked about jorg even though i didn t love everything about him lawrence s captivating writing and smooth prose keep the pages flying and have not a little to do
6531,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,with my reading time becoming increasingly precious only the very best authors make it to my reading pile at all and of those i went with lawrence to read after finally finishing edits to the daylight war lawrence s poetic prose is amazing far and away the best of the modern fantasy authors the prose can get a little hard to follow if you re sleepy or your brain is fried after a long day but this is hardly a quibble first person narrative is arguably the most difficult pov style and lawr
6532,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4, the warrior rides a black stallion smoke shrouds the castle ruins behind him and the wind gives only glimpses of the corpse choked gap between high and broken walls that same wind streams long dark hair across his shoulders like a pennant and flutters the remnants of his cloak to his left and right more riders emerge from the fog of war warriors all their armour dented torn smeared with soot and blood honourous jorg ancrath the prince of thorns has become a king in his own right an
6533,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,this month i am recommending both prince of thorns and king of thorns by mark lawrence they are two of three with the third not yet published i have read the first and am halfway through the second as a fantasy tale prince jorg ancraft s story is quite extraordinary it begins when he is num and already a stone cold killer with a horrific past this is a dangerous and risky protagonist for any author to put forth but lawrence does it with verve and confidence it is like a train wreck from
6534,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,the most interesting thing i took away from this book was that i started to like jorg albeit just a bit more he still does reprehensible things don t get me wrong but he s older and wiser and not so eager to jump in and kill people without asking questions first he strategizes a great deal more as well and really tries to think many steps ahead of his opponents jorg actually seems to be bothered when certain people are hurt or die instead of just forgetting them and moving on he thinks
6535,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,king of thorns num broken empire by mark lawrence hmm what to say about this author and this series without spoiling any of the twists or surprises book one prince of thorns was one of the surprises of num if you didn t get it on your to do list you should add it now i ll wait while you do ok done at it s essence this series is a very dark and violent tale told first person from the point of view of jorg the young and disturbed ringleader of a brutal band of wandering misfits bro
6536,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,2,i don t want to be harsh and all but all i can say of king of thorns would be that it was fucking boring it s a shame compared to prince of thorns the plot s utterly full of useless shit this novel could ve been way shorter it has num pages on my ipad and most of the novel was full of useless conversations it also has too much adjectives and tends to describe things longer than it should and where the fuck is the action i really liked the first book because it was full of violence
6537,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,this second book in the broken empire series was of a similar quality to the first which means it was pretty good the story this story picks up num years after the end of the first book an num year old jorg now sits on the throne of renar but still dreams of being emperor his main competition for the role the beloved prince of arrow marches on jorg s kingdom with an army many times that of renar in a fair fight there would only be one winner fighting fair has never been part of honorous jor
6539,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,3,the sociopath is at it again while i despised jorg in prince of thorns the story itself was highly entertaining and kept me turning pages as quickly as i could read them   however i did not find this novel as engrossing perhaps because i ve grown somewhat use to the main character s sociopathic behavior in any event since the shock value of jorg didn t overwhelm me this go round i found myself focusing a great deal on the story itself which quite honestly was a bit underwhelming   i co
6540,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,well i’m pleased to say that i am pleasantly surprised at my feelings towards this book upon first reading i didn’t much care for it at all i didn’t like jorg i didn’t care for his brothers and i got overly confused by the different timelines in this book couple that with my tendency to read rather quickly and i was left rather underwhelmed however upon my re read num years later my opinions have changed somewhat don’t get me wrong i still didn’t much care for jorg’s brothers i don’t fee
6542,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,king jorg somehow finds a way to make you root for him as a reader despite his brutality he is bold rash relentless ruthless and shameless in pursuit of power and vengeance i love falling in love with the characters and king jorg ancrath i have to say it only got better in the second installment and now on to the next book 
6543,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,the broken empire is a trilogy that i was absolutely afraid to even touch due to reviews about how violent and gritty it is and because of rape scenes that are really hard to read about it s been on my to read list for a long time as i found the story quite intriguing but all these comments about rape sensitive issues put me off it was when i read a short story by mark lawrence in unfettered and then the sleeping beauty i loved the atmosphere and ml s wonderful prose in the short stories so i
6544,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,this was really good i loved that there were mainly two different storylines in different times four years ago and wedding day also since jorg himself did not know his own plan and what happened in the past we got to figure it out together i am surprised that i like jorg he really comes off as the villain most of the time but still i feel sorry for him and also really want him to win the war and become emperor in any case now i need to get my hands on the third book cause i am curious t
6545,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,prince of thorns impressed the hell out of me jorg ancrath is the best kind of protagonist flawed stumbling sometimes evil he s human and has that greatest of human capacities the ability to make mistakes learn from them and drag the world forward with him jorg doesn t disappoint in the numnd installment in the series if anything his sharp wit dark perceptive humor and almost precognizant read of complex situations develops lawrence ups the stakes in king of thorns and takes a comple
6546,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,in king of thorns jorg of ancrath takes the next step on his path to power again author mark lawrence shows us the becoming of a villain and as jorg matures the story does as well first time readers beware this review will most likely to contain spoilers for prince of thorns as in his first novel mark lawrence divides the narrative into two timelines the first timeline starts immediately after the concluding events of prince of thorns and shows us what jorg and his brothers are up to for th
6547,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,i liked this one even more than the first there are a lot of surprises as the world gets more and more flushed out jorg is a unique character and the end is great when you find out what s going on inside him and how katherine and sageous fit into it and how he s poised to live the next phase of his life i can t wait to finish the series my only complaint is that it felt a little disjointed at times with about half of it being a flashback and half being jorg s present day i think it w
6548,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,mark lawrence accustomed his readers to a tale swinging wildly between the now and the past this is how he crafts his stories and he surely knows how to do this i mean swinging and also wildly thus we meet jorg on his wedding day he is eighteen a young man hundreds of days stand between him and the revenge obsessed kid thinking of gutting every second person that crosses his path he is reshaped but not broken he is burnt but not burned out and he is getting married but not to the woma
6549,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,even better than the first more action more emotion amazing character development i highly suggest you pick up this series if you haven t already i can t wait to devour the final book though i ll be sad to see this story end a dark time comes my time if it offends you stop me 
6550,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,i know this may sound odd since this is such a dark book but i actually laughed out loud several times while reading this book i don t know how lawrence created a sociopath who is hilarious at the same time and who you actually feel sympathy for this is a great book 
6551,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,http //www rantingdragon com/review o our favorite debut of last year was unquestionably mark lawrence’s prince of thorns a dark brutally captivating tale of epic fantasy—or low opinions on that were divided this august will bring us king of thorns the second volume in the broken empire and sequel to prince of thorns what he started in his debut lawrence expands in king of thorns again this is a breathtaking captivating and violent venture into a wonderful world filled with morally
6552,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,brilliant i was twenty pages from the end when i had to stop to write this review before i forgot what i had to say i have never done that before king of thorns is better than the first book it is brutally brilliant gruesomely good and amid the carnage offers slivers of a rainbow before snatching it away in a world and future as grim and real as any out there amid the wickedness that is jorg ancrath you will find wit and wisdom to match sometimes almost too much for a young man of eighteen
6553,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,today is a glorious day his highness honorous jorg ancrath king of the renar highlands heir to the lands of ancrath and the protectorates thereof is getting married he stands beside his beautiful bride fresh and perky as the lilies on her head in a chapel once they’ve said their vows and made the marriage official they leave hand in hand to the applause and hoorahs of his people the nobility who believe that he will save them and bring peace to their domain woah hang on one damned minut
6554,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,still loving it the writing stlye is a masterpiece but dammit i ve got lost in the timeline again so this flaw chalks up on the books board not my inexpertness with the genre when i first read kot king of thorns really needs your attention otherwise you may get a bit lost in the timeline the story whirls the reader between real time events and several flashbacks it s a bit confusing but eventually a clear picture emerges as to what jorg has blanked out from his mind what was taken from
6555,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,jorg ancrath has been haunting my dreams since book one i love everything about the book and all the characters i got to know them better and care for them oh how i love jorg❤❤❤
6556,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,3,executive summary i thought this was another decent entry to this series where i care more about the world building than the main character and his story audiobook james clamp does a good job he reads with good volume and pace he also does some voices that adds a little extra that makes audio a great options for this book full review this series has a very unlikeable protagonist i don t dislike him as much as many do mostly i find myself a bit uninterested which is probably worse love
6557,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,you can see that i gave this book five stars that s actually five trillion stars for king of awesome but gr is pretty stingy with its stars it gave me a five star limit anyway i think i should let it out that the broken empire series is why i hate mark lawrence so much not only was i supposed to be studying for two tests when i read this second book but i was also supposed to be studying for an exam when i read the first book prince of thorns i had fun reading the books but my grades d
6558,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,as always this review and more can be found at book geeks uncompromised my rating for this book is more objective than probably most of my other ratings are despite my personal feelings on this book i can’t deny that it is well done and likely enjoyable by a great many people that are not me here we are back with our jorg ancrath the teenager that lives for blood and murder well not exactly but it’s really not too far from the truth jorg is back along with his his small goal of ruling the
6559,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,i was a little afraid about starting this series as the reviews are very contradictory some people loved the books others totally hated them or jorg for me it was a go go from the very start i got fascinated by the characters the world and the hints at more than meets the eye the whole series deals with politics scheming magic mostly dark ruthlessness betrayals and lots of gory and cruel details about murders battles and war even so i snorted some many times as there is also
6560,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,“i wanted to win the throne was just a token to demonstrate that victory and i wanted to win because other men had said that i may not i wanted to fight because fighting ran through me i gave less for the people than for the dung heap we rolled makin in ” by now you should be well acquainted with jorg of ancrath recently king jorg of the renar highlands he s beginning to grow from temperamental vengeful prince into temperamental vengeful king hellbent on becoming emperor it may not see
6561,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,what the feck honorous jorg ancrath is cruel clever and manipulating but he most certainly has no honor he takes what he wants at whatever the cost and subsequently the paths he takes end up littered with the dead some of which haunt him from the shadows he may be one evil necromantic young bastard but he shows a little growth and maturity in this second installment his thoughts have grown to include a more sympathetic understanding of the plights of others and despite his sociopathic
6563,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,truly brilliant what an ending love the character development of jorg so far i should probably spend less time reading these books and more time revising for my imminent exams bring on the next one red jorg 
6565,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,and now an exhaustive look at the dos and don ts of kicking a severed head as told by jorg ancrath i dropped the head and kicked it into the crowd i say kicked but in truth it s a bad idea to kick a head i learned that years ago a lesson that cost me two broken toes what you want to do is shove the head with the side of your foot like you re throwing it it s going to roll anyhow so you don t need that much force see the thing about severed heads is the owner no longer has any intere
6566,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,this book blew me away and answered unanswered questions i didn t know i had from the first book prince of thorns the anti hero jorg has made himself a king of sorts in book one of the series prince of thorns we meet jorg and get introduced to his vengence against his evil uncle and father jorg s is a child bandit at num running a gang of killers and rapist why because he helped them escape his father s dungeon and he is brilliant so they let him lead it s clear that jorg is ruthless
6567,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,i felt this was better than the first book in the series its more complex in a way and the characterization was better as well there are characters who died that i didn’t want to die and even prince jorg becomes more likeable the story starts off num years from when jorg wrested the renar highlands from his uncle where he has set himself up as a king outside his walls he is surrounded by twenty thousand soldiers led by the prince of arrow who intends to crush jorg in a bid to become emperor 
6568,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,num stars king of thorns is one of those rare exceptions that have the sequel actually being better than the first this book has a better plot more character development and an incredible ending jorg has taken the definition of an antihero dragged it through the mud and scum bathed it in blood and filth and caused us readers to wonder how far can he go and how far can we follow him lawrence has created a world that is simply incredible as in the first book there are small snippets and morse
6569,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,mark lawrence is carving a bloody path to the top of my favorite authors list this book is a brilliant sequel to prince of thorns read my review here king of thorns

6572,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,wow better than prince of thorns are you kidding it was such a treat for my opinion to do a num° with this book the main character was so changed since the first novel that i felt disappointed at first i absolutely loved pot s jorg and i just wanted to see more of the brutal ruthless cunning little maniac what a main character he was but now we come to king of thorns where jorg is a little older and more mature calmer introspective strategic both jorg s character and his story ar
6573,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,oh wow this book when i decided to put this book into my reading month i can honestly say that whilst i remembered enjoying the first prince of thorns i didn t remember quite so much about it this book however was a step up from book num for sure and it s certainly one where i think some scenes will stay with me in this book we follow jorg once again and this time we are following two plotlines the first plotline is the present day and this is set on jorg s wedding day which isn t the aver
6574,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,i m just going to say right off the bat that i enjoyed the first book a lot better than king of thorns however in many respects this book is much better than its predecessor it s better written a lot gorier but also strangely humorous just like the first book joe abercrombie and mark lawrence must have a knack for mixing humor and violence incidentally i recently read an interview of mark lawrence where he said that he d never read any ja books well that s interesting also i spotted q
6575,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,where book one was a mixing bowl of madness crazy writing with randomness thrown in for good measure book two is a journey into mind fucking whilst i am spare with profanity in my reviews and in life generally i find when i do need decide to use them it tends to give credence to the impact statement i am trying to make this was a big bold move on lawrence s part this type of writing reminds me a little of the first law series where the first of the trilogy is really just a character build
6576,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,i ve been thinking about this book a lot lately partially because i m enrolled in the spfbo hosted by the generous grimdark god mark lawrence and partially because i ve been thinking about all the things this book got right which i should replicate in my own writing interestingly enough despite king of thorns being my favorite jorg book it seems to be the least popular among fans of the series i don t know why that is but i know i loved it num jorg s relationships develop quite a bit in
6577,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,i recently read a piece of writing advice about how to properly write violence and death by always making it count be it the character committing the act the victim or the observer violence has to have a price gratuitous violence is just too easy my thoughts went immediately to the broken empire series and it s antagonist king jorg ancrath violence in his past shaped child into man by breaking him and letting the darkness we all harbour within ooze out the article made me further appreci
6578,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,there are very few constants in the world even the certainty of the speed of light is becoming debatable i realized that as i got older growing up is the slow disrobing of ideals – at num not crapping your pants is an accomplishment worthy of a nordic saga at num a smile is not just an expression of happiness as you always thought before it may be an invitation to carnal pleasures and suddenly everything is an innuendo at num your parents suddenly tumble from their pedestals and you realize t
6579,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,“mark lawrence follows up to prince of thorns with a cracking compelling unpredictable sequel that succeeds in almost every way my new favourite fantasy novel of num ” the founding fields you know in my review of the blinding knife i mentioned that i’d found a favourite fantasy of novel of num well as it happens the very next fantasy novel that i read beats a brent weeks novel something that i’d never thought possible unless the name of that author was george rr martin peter v brett
6580,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,well that was a hell of a ride i read the second half of this book over the course of num days which is quite rare for me given how slowly i read that should tell you something about how much i enjoyed it so king of thorns follows on fairly directly from prince and also not jorg feels a bit more human this time around slightly fewer sharp edges and not quite as much of an arsehole though he is still very much an arsehole the story is told across num different timelines there s jorg s we
6581,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,surely in coming to this volume you will have already read the first and your fascination with jorg s character has overcome your distaste weeded out already are those who were not prepared to read about a protagonist they wouldn t want to be best buddies with and the generally squeamish those who read this volume should already know what they are letting themselves in for if you couldn t abide the first book you wont want to read this in this volume the character of jorg continues to rip
6582,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,i remember reading somewhere that when writing a novel you should never use flashback because it ll distract the reader and make the book an absolute load of wank no shit seriously apparently mark lawrence is flipping the bird to the literary critics and laughing his lungs out a good num of king of thorns is nothing but flashback and guess what it works ha it really does and in a marvellous way the novel is sort of a patchwork made of short stories i absolutely loved the circus
6583,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,synopsis four years have passed since prince honorous jorg ancrath took the throne of renar from his uncle and now the time has come for the young king to wed his beautiful bride a wedding is often seen as an occasion to celebrate for jorg it may not be so the prince of arrow a champion of the people stands outside the haunt with an army of twenty thousand soldiers waiting for the king to surrender the once young boy now a king is all too familiar with those who pull the strings behind t
6584,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,full review originally at fantasy book critic analysis last year mark lawrence debuted on the fantasy scene with his dark and morally tipsy book prince of thorns it shocked many readers and led to interesting debates about the book its main protagonist and the overall direction of the story i thought that the writing and storyline was sheer brilliance mark lawrence’s plot had the main protagonist who is a teenage sociopath and who in most novels would be featured as the series villain the
6585,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,2,book num num book num num num i think i m firmly in the minority in liking book one so much more but while that book was fueled by jorg s grief and i loved that introspective this book lacked that it never picked up steam for me and was a bit rambling 
6586,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,this was a slow burner for me but it delivered when all the strands came together i struggled with the dual timelines at the start but as i got further into the book i started to look forward to switching so i could get another little piece of the puzzle possibly better than the first book for me interesting setup for the third keen to see how it all pans out 🗡⚔ well worth a read
6587,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,that was just brilliant the timeline bouncing between four years ago and now made for a really well developed story jorg is still his wonderfully terrible self can t wait to see what he does next 
6588,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,king of thorns tops my list of most anticipated books in num now that i’ve read it its ownership of the top spot is absolutely validated i fully intended to ram my way through all num pages of the harper voyager hardcover but i couldn’t it took me five days there are books so good so ‘unputdownable’ you breeze through them king of thorns is not that kind of book rather it is a book so beautiful and sublime that i deliberately slowed my reading lest i miss a single meaningful word or nua
6589,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,in chess there are pawns knights queens bishops and more but there are no princes so in this game i have become a king chess is black and white which suits me rather well a black king but where’s the read there should be red a lot of it a lot of red a lot of blood because i’ve played all my pawns for check mate i’ve got one castle one knight a queen and a king on my side of the board but there’s six boards against my one side surely that’s against the rules why am i com
6590,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,this sequel is better than its predecessor firstly the structure was quite interesting – it comprised a present day narration which covered all of a single day’s events journal entries of katherine ap scorron read by jorg and flashbacks to num years ago after jorg took the throne of renar i found that this worked well to thread together all the various plotlines and jorg’s well laid plans to culminate into the present day arc there were however times when i was not sure what was happe
6591,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,like the first book on the surface the story of king of thorns is a simple one in one timeline a young man goes on an adventure to seek help from a wizard and four years later in the present time he is defending his kingdom from a rival prince sounds straightforward and rather typical but the truth is that this book is as dark as its predecessor if you re an avid reader of fantasy the story elements and tropes will feel familiar except more twisted and messed up i was glad to see that
6592,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,this is without any shadow of doubt the best book of num you have got to read this it takes you on a whirlwind of emotions and feelings i have rarely felt for a main character and rolls it up into a heart thumping tale of blood lust revenge and outright audacity i could not put it down mr lawrence has done what i did not expect and made jorg even better in this book than in prince of thorns if you have read the first book and were unsure if it could get any better then read this one you wil
6593,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,loved this part much better partly cause i understood how the storylines are put together it was still very confusing i wouldnt say annoying cause it was really captivating i feel like i should reread it to understand it better and i really dont mean this in a bad way looking forward to the final book a man is made of memories it is all we are captured moments the smell of a place scenes played out time and again on a small stage we are memories strung on storylines the tales we te
6594,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,how is it possible that i enjoyed such a horrible book its not horrible in the way it is written its that is so bloodthirsty cruel and downright evil we learn a lot more of what jorg has been through as a child and its not surprising he has turned out the way he is

6596,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,was it worth spending a month slugging through this book i am not really sure but i liked prince of thorns and i wasn t about to turn a blind eye to king of thorns also the title of king sounds so much more badass than prince methinks this has got to be the best num euro i have spent may contain spoilers read at your own risk this was in my opinion the strangest num star worthy book i have read it builds up slowly rarely displays any hint of action or anything aside from jo
6597,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,when i started this book i thought to myself how will this book hold its own against part one i felt like the author must have already played all his cards that s how amazed i was by the first book of this trilogy but no the second book started with a bang and it just kept on delivering it was sometimes somewhat difficult for me to discern past happenings from the present does this character know this at this point especially because the author plays around with the main character s
6598,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,this was a very good read there were a few things that i didn t like but i got over it there lots of blood a lot of fighting the end is satisfying everything is all set up for the final book in the series 
6599,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,oh jorg ok so i wasn t intending to write a review but i do have a few things i need to put down to remind myself of what this book was about in short this about jorg getting married katherine getting married the prince of orrin a box of thorns war blood smartness sadness happiness conflictedness actually those last three are just me so jorg has to get married to this num year old who btw i adore i think she suits him to a t far better than katherine ever would have jorg is still
6600,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,i appreciate jorg s development for the best in this installment here we get a glimpse at the human the kid below all that mountain of wrong that jorg has made of himself his enemy is his complete contrary a man whose strength comes from the better part of what the broken empire is full of the pov s also worked really well mark does well for it never feels disrupting in the slightest 
6601,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,although it took roughly num of the novel until we got to the meat of the action in this book i still really enjoyed the whole thing jorg is probably one of the most interesting characters i ve ever been able to read from the point of view of although he was a bit tame at times he certainly made up for it in the end and what an ending very intense bring on book three 
6602,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,i like myself a good sociopath they make things interesting in a world of heroes and anti heroes if well written i found a new favorite in jorg of ancrath when i read prince of thorns and wrote this review in the second book of the broken empire series jorg is now king of the renar highlands and he s all grown up now eighteen he s preparing to marry his young bride princess miana with an army knocking at his door the prince of arrow wants to roll right over him with numbers jorg can t hope
6603,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,i was less than impressed with the predecessor to this novel it came across as forced frustrating and playing to the modern fantasy crowd so in awe of g r r martin though there are easily better classic fantasy series around which don t push the dark and grim idea there was something about this novel however as a sequel that blew the first novel s failings out of the water and improved upon them immensely perhaps it was the expanded world there were hints in the first novel that what mark
6604,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,as you can probably gather from the title our dear jorgy managed to achieve his goal of becoming a king and now all his problems are solved and happiness is his oh wait no not that actually the armies of the combined nations of another claimant to the empire s throne outnumbering his by a paltry num to num are marching on him to take his submission or his head and if we ve learned anything about jorg it s that he d rather die than submit and he d certainly rather kill of course ha
6605,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,why brother jorg you ve gotten even more clever king of thorns the second installment in the broken empire makes an excellent second book the book instead of picking the story from book one jumps four years ahead and we join jorg on his wedding day the book actually has three narrations one on the wedding day one of jorg s recollection of events four years past and one presented in the form of katherine s diary as usual the narration is often complicated as it shifts back and forth bot
6606,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5, i will burn the world if it defies me king of thorns is not an easy read by any means i really took my time with this as i wanted to properly enjoy mark s unique world building and beautiful writing jorg is jorg one of a kind psychopath who is now man grown he is the main reason i even started reading this series in the first place and again he didn t fail me still an evil bastard through and through but i think he might be on his way to redemption or not either way he is bad ass
6607,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,king jorg celebrates his wedding day but all is not auspicious the prince of arrow has surrounded the haunt with thousands of men on his way to becoming emperor the prince will defeat all and any in his path and jorg is in the way jorg has a necromantic power he does not want a mysterious copper box he fears to open and a ghost who haunts him in private moments his new determined wife is an intriguing addition to the mix young but fearsome and katherine has her own most welcome poi
6608,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,this book was way better than the first one i liked how the characters personalities and thoughts are explored more i finally got to see jorg as something more than just a little bastard asshole which definitely helped me enjoy the story more i still get confused with the different times at which the story is set i have to take real good notice of the chapter names and not stop reading halfway through a chapter other than that i really enjoyed this book more than prince of thorns so that 
6609,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,a well written book with brilliant prose and a story that is at once fluid and well structured king of thorns assembles a great cast of characters princes earls fire sworn sorcerers völvas necromancers and more but it is honorous jorg ancrath that made this a page turner for me his growth ambition razor sharp wit his decision making in dealing with the various obstacles placed in his way all make for an enjoyable read when you read mark lawrence you can expect a constant dosage of b
6610,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,there s not much to say about the numnd book in a series without spoiling the first one and usually the book in the middle just kind of hangs between the other two books and glues them together not this one though king of thorns definitely stands on its own two feet it s a great story with a wonderful anti hero that i love to hate but secretly love mark lawrence s writing is solid the world building definitely very interesting and i m looking forward to reading the conclusion 
6611,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,better than the first one by a hefty margin http //staffersmusings blogspot com/num 
6612,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,king of thorns is the second book in the the broken empire trilogy as we continue to follow the tale of jorg i really enjoyed this book it was even better than the first one and i really liked the first one too we follow two story plots in this book jorg in the present time as a six nation army marches toward jorg s gates led by a shining hero determined to unite the empire and heal its wounds and the past plot line which follows jorg from end of book one and how he got to the present st
6613,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,in heavily paraphrased words of robin hobb this book was so amazing that i came late to work for past num days and seriously considered taking day off the chain of events even though it goes back and forth in time like in prince of thorns in this book is so captivating that even skipping to the last chapter and knowing the spoilers for whole thrillogy couldn t keep me from reading it in the morning missing breakfast leaving in a hurry and arriving almost an hour late 
6614,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,last year when i read prince of thorns i had one of those moments where i gained a new appreciation for the written word it set a new standard for every other fantasy novel i read and i read only fantasy novels i didn t know how i was going to get by until august num num the most anticipated day of the year wait numnd most my wedding day is first right right then august numth arrived oh happy day i immediately threw aside my other responsibilities namely health and personal hygiene

6616,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5, a time of terror comes a dark time the graves continue to open and the dead king prepares to sail but the world holds worse things than dead men a dark time comes my time if it offends you stop me i probably shouldn t write this thing now i know mainly because i just finished the book and all my thoughts are clouded by the magnificence of the finale so maybe i ll delete this tomorrow and rewrite a new one or maybe not where i should start i had such high expectations for this book and
6617,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,after reading the prince of thorns the king of thorns instantly became my most eagerly anticipated book of everything i have read or want to read amidst the darkness that is jorg ancrath you will find also find wit and wisdom in abundance far outstripping a young man of eighteen years but then he is not a normal young man jorg ancrath despite the brutality has a confidence charm and swagger that endear you to the character quite simply he is one of the best characters in fantasy fiction told
6618,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,there are good books there are books where you can observe that by most standards they have achieved outstanding new limits i can still criticize my lack of sensibility to them when i question whether i should read each and every a good book then there are books like this that draw you in before you have time to think of standards and never let go this book unlike the first takes a decidedly darker and more mature tone than the other the first is unique for jorg s voice and the origi
6619,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,excellent i wish it had been longer though mainly because the story took a while to get going and then it did and then it rushed through a series of events and then boom finished i would want more spent on how jorg learnt about fexler brews and his manner of death and more importantly all the adventures he had while he was touring the empire but this is a call for more lawrence has delivered yet another deeply dark and intense tale that when i describe it to my friends i say it s game o
6620,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,ok so i wanted to wait and write my review after i finished the whole trilogy instead of reviewing each book individually all i can say is wow from character and world development to gripping plot to mark s unique style of storytelling i thoroughly enjoyed the ride from beginning to end of course like most i was left wanting more a lot more but i have to agree with mark s afterthought pushing a good thing too far can ruin it i was left disappointed in a good way i highly recommend
6621,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,the second installment did not disappoint picking up from the first one and expanding in just about every area the plot is more complex there is a lot more content and we get to see some real depth in jorg s character although i felt it slowed a bit in the middle the book certainly picks up for its conclusion this is not a series for everyone lawrence s blunt writing and strong emphasis on show not tell is something not every reader will be able to stick but for those who are look

6623,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,spectacular completely fecking spectacular i spent a significant part of this book thinking i liked it but maybe a little bit less than the first book prince of thorns then the end happened it was perfect it blew me away it gelled why i d been feeling differently about this book and then about faced and we were back on the level and all was well and now i love this one even more than the first adventure a sprinkling of psycho battling personal demons kicking ass taking names great
6624,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,this trilogy is like wine the older it gets the better although i absolutely loved the first one i just thought it couldn’t get any better and it did in so many levels i adore that we get to see and know a little bit more of katherine and jorg oh jorg i love you forever one of the most interesting and amazing character to read and know more about it can t wait to read the sequel but i don t wanna to end mark lawrence did it again another book that i just couldn t stop reading 
6625,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,there is the occasional book that comes along and makes you consider changing all your other five star reviews to four stars these books are rare because each time one comes along it sets the bar that much higher for the next book can you believe it i ve read two of them this year back to back and they re both by mark lawrence just read this series pick up your kindle or your nook or do like i did and order the hardbacks for the top shelf because this is top shelf material 
6626,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,okay so that was actually num stars favorite quote “the next words out of your mouth priest will be ‘yes your highness’ or you’ll be making a meal of this cane ” to his credit the priest hesitated then said “yes your highness ” i doubt he believed my lineage but he sure as hell believed my culinary predictions

6630,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,ah that difficult middle book of the trilogy the one that carries all the baggage of the first without the freshness while also setting up the climax of the third without being able to resolve the big questions all too often it feels like drifting there’s motion of a sort but it’s slow or undirected there’s an element of that here what seems like the main plot the massive army of the prince of arrows camped at jorg’s gate seems to play second fiddle to the flashback story which feels
6631,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,july num num well here i am almost a year later and finally taking the time to put down some more competent thoughts on this book whose definition of competent is another story let me just start by saying i am very guilty of finishing a book with omg that was the best thing i ve ever read see initial review of this book below i m very very easily excitable those thoughts and feelings usually wear off with time or with the next best thing i ve ever read that being said this past
6632,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,it pains me how much i hate aka love this book my feelings towards jorg are unexpressable i hate him love him adore him want to strangle him want to shake him want to hug him want to put some sense in his stubborn minds desperately want him to succeed i m not sure whether there have been any character less worth to have his hea but i so want jorg to have it and the writing it s so lyrical i know huh it s so difficult to summarize this book you think you already got what s th
6633,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,an epic roller coster of a journey especially at the end where everything was finally tied up there are a lot of slow and confusing parts in this book that bored me out since the tale started with four seperate points in time and confuses the reader to no end however about num/num way into the book all of those points finally come together and started to made sense cultimating to an epic finale where jorg conquers all once again this book also showed a great character development and depth i
6634,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,mark lawrence has outdone himself i love the evolution of vengeance what starts of as a crude and feral kind of vengeance we see becomes a more conflicting sort even jorg displays regret and a strange sort of moral conflict but despite all that he stays the ruthless murderous bastard we all hate and love 
6635,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,this book has to be one of the most ambitious narratives i ve ever read it s plotted between the present of the time of the book of course and four years prior it moves seamlessly through these two times weaving together a very complex tale and it does it successfully as the past and the present blend without snare to present a very broad image the first book was something of an acquired taste jorg ancrath was an arrow fired from a blindman s bow hellbent on destruction pain and panic
6636,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,my blog hi books it s me jethplain warning review contains some spoilers jorg has now settled in the role of king of the renar highlands after extracting revenge from his uncle in the first book and like the first the story is told from his perspective in the present wedding day and in the past num years ago num or so months after he took the highlands like the title it starts with his wedding day while outside the prince of arrow s thousands march their way into his castle as in prince of
6637,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,an absolutely worthy sequel of prince of thorns i simply couldn t put the book down it s a deeper and more complex book while the first is mostly linear this one is a roller coaster full of surprises and aha moments it was really interesting to see jorg s personality developing even more his monologues were written impressively it feels like many thoughts the author had himself and managed to give them to jorg be it about the essence of men or mountain climbing i m glad jorg isn t the edg
6638,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,i ll start off by saying that although i liked this book it wasn t as enjoyable as prince of thorns that in no way means that it isn t good it s just that i found the four years earlier concept a little harder to follow in king of thorns leaving me feeling somewhat confused on occasions and as i wrote in a couple of my pre review notes gr have wrongly estimated the number of pages as num my copy has num pages those of you who have read prince of thorns will be aware that jorg ancrath is
6639,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,2,this book was a little frustrating to me i really wanted to adore it but i’m afraid i’m not able to mark lawrence seems like a great guy he is a very active member of the fantasy community over reddit and is always there to support comment or give an opinion he’s a funny guy and i ve read a few of his blog posts and enjoyed them but for the life of me i can’t enjoy his books like my peers at /r/fantasy you see i don’t think this is a bad book i just can’t understand what’s all the ra
6640,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,very different from anything i have read in a good way great read very intelligently written and fantastic prose 
6641,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,the second book in this unique fantasy/ scifi blend firstly a must in my opinion is that you read book one king of thorns just doesn t work without having experienced prince of thorns the main character jorg so basic so simple and yet so complex and so diverse its an amazing feat to have achieved on paper for me something this complex comes with a fair bit of yawning and desire to skip a few pages but not with this book or prince the clear writing and story direction just enthrals the re
6642,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,another very good book and worthy sequel from mark lawrence as always in my review i won t describe any summary of the plot or something like it it s up there and you can read it i ll just word my thoughts which are mostly possitive i think what lawrence does with this book is take everything from the first book and turn it up a notch that includes everything that is good but also some things that are not so good negatives first and i d say that for me there are num of them one is that even
6643,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,king of thorns isn’t just better than prince of thorns it improves on it let me explain what that means the first book was all about setting up jorg’s character i’ve discussed it at length so i won’t do so again but every reader has a clear picture though not necessarily the same picture of who we’re reading about king of thorns takes this and plays with it exploring it to a depth not fully realized in the first volume you thought jorg was a complex character just wait until you’ve rea
6644,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,brilliant a great follow up it kept me turning page after page i can t wait to finish off with emperor now 
6645,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,when i read first read the prince of thorns i came away from it feeling as it that book had subtly changed my life it was an experience i think not dissimilar to the one jorg described in the king of thorns having climbed to the top of that mountain and seeing the world from such a different perspective everything afterward was just a little bit changed from what it had been before because he had changed too that is what the prince of thorns did for me i had thought it to be one of the best
6647,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,the worst part about this book the third one doesn t come out until august num admittedly the second begins a little slower jorg doesn t seem his evil fun self at least not as much as the first book take heart gentle reader everything has its time and purpose mr lawrence deftly uses the two storylines present day is four years after the first book ends while the flashbacks represent events which happened shortly after the first ends to paint an unfolding tapestry which keep the ten
6648,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,there is no way i could write a good enough review that would do this book justice it s so clever and i absolutely loved it the character development on all the characters from the first book is brilliant i think gog definitely became one of my favourites it was interesting that this book was written so we read from both the past and the present it was exciting to find out what happened in the past slowly and made this book so hard to put down the plot was so interesting i was completely una
6649,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,if you can read prince of thorns and not want to read king of thorns i would get checked out similarly if you can read king of thorns and not sit waiting like the rest of us for emperor of thorns to be released i would suggest couseling seriously though this story only adds to what was an incredible start in prince of thorns the action does not die down and the story only gets thicker weddings and deaths blood and the unmatched wit of jorg will carry you to the last page where you will p

6655,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,this book is so damn amazing my questions from the previous book were answered in king of thorns but it arises new questions that i feel a great need for answers right now i love how this book had me second guessing not just to how jorg will win his battles but also how he sits in the plan of the players in conquering and uniting the broken empire i love how jorg resists the manipulation of the players how he remains to be vicious but a bit more mature still evil and flawed but with a littl
6656,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,the first book prince of thorns was a packed potential legend but with a lead who failed miserably in my eyes it still held a compulsive allure to it a sense of a deeper story lying hidden beneath the shallow waters enough to make me eager to plow on with the next book king of thorns was nothing like its predecessor and everything which i wanted it to be jorg ancrath a lead can make a story or break it and this one not only makes it he welds together all the ends in a knot so tight and
6659,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,3,still a really enjoyable series however i did not like this one more then the first book this reason is mainly because of how the story was told there is a time jump of four years and that is where the story starts but then we also flashback to find out what happened after the events in the first book i found the flashback arc of this book to be more invested then the present i did love the ending to this book however and i am really intrigued to see where this book goes i know it is going

6664,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,underneath the dark gritty prose is a truly epic masterpiece that is so exceptional as to outshine other writers within this genre the eagerly anticipated sequel to ‘prince of thorns’ exceeds all expectations with mark lawrence’s writing just getting better and better as his inspired creation contains even more depth similar to joe abercrombie this bloodcurdling graphic narrative is coated in blood gore and is so atmospheric that you can actually smell the putrid stench of death see the

6672,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,this book works for me mostly because jorg is such a unique sort of protagonist that he gets me hooked and truly interested in knowing what made him walk the path he s walking because socipaths are not born in a day you know and here i found a more grown up jorg not necessarily more human but more mature and aware of the fact his actions have repercusions and come with a burden he has to bear i enjoyed watching jorg evolve and seeing the people gathered around him go from felons to loyal fo

6678,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,brother mark many thanks for writing the book – which technically i have never actually read as you know as a non reader of your book please allow me a letter of complaint in the many written commentary of yours i did not come across one single warning about the consequences of opening a door to the broken empire the tube stops i would miss as temporarily lost in some awful dead end marshland somewhere far far away the sleepless nights spent witnessing violent deeds of blood and fire subs
6679,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,king of thorns is the best book of the trilogy one of the best i have ever read each page is a different surprise a big different surprise mark lawrence gave his best in this book and jorg too the creator and the creation have a visible progress in this work both of them seem magical while stealing our attention they run a preposterous plan in our blind spot the fusion of plots is the grand finale that every magician would like for their show so prepare your mind before you read it becau
6680,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,i m still fascinated by the fact that i m rooting for jorg no matter what the situation is he is greedy selfish sadistic and foolhardy yet i enjoy every bit of it i love his sarcasm and the humor that goes along with it jorg is what makes the story so interesting his character is like none that i have read before never have i cared so much for the overly prideful lawrence has done a wonderful job molding this character into someone we all can relate to at some point and keeping us inte
6681,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,this trilogy keeps getting better the further i wade into it jorg ancrath is still playing the game of empire using his own rules and placing the right pieces in place this guy has an amazing handle on playing the long game as he deftly maneuvers himself closer to the empire throne in king of thorns it is clear to readers of prince of thorns that jorg is growing up and maturing that is not to say he s unwilling to make difficult gory choices he is willing but doesn t revel in the gore as
6682,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,2,edit i have read book num and gave it num stars so there i was very excited to get back to this series so much that even stephen king had a hard time keeping me focused with dr sleep prince of thorns was still resonating in my mind that book held everything i appreciate in fantasy a great story mysteries about the world and cool revelations a lot of reviewers mention the same thing about this book in comparing it to its predecessor it was as if the author grew up with more polished writin
6683,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,2,i really really really liked book num so obviously i was excited to pick up book num but sadly that has ended in a bit of a disappointment the only reason why i m giving this book num stars instead of the num that i was planning to give it was because the last couple of chapters were okayish they were interesting in this book you follow num different plot lines num jorg not that long after book num ended called num years earlier num jorg when he s num called wedding day num katherine through her diaries now
6684,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,previous to this i read ‘legend’ by david gemmel and also recently sanderson’s ‘way of kings’ and it was hilarious watching the traditional conventions of heroic/high fantasy being wreaked havoc upon here by jorg and his brothers but that was just the tip of the ice burg both plot and character development in king of thorns were outstanding genius each scene profoundly vivid and beautifully written the style and grace of a masterpiece start to finish and this book contains the most exci
6685,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,3,i can t even cope with this series it s silly and gross one moment and then powerful and moving the next it s hard to get a handle on jorg as a character partially because he has elements of a gritty wish fulfillment antihero but also is textually shown to be a bad person who has committed inexcusable atrocities he s a sympathetic character but also vile but also delightfully awful and i can t help but want him to win but i also can t help but want him to be a better person even though i
6686,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,without sounding overly enthusiastic this series is shaping up to be the best fantasy series i have ever read the story alone is brilliant enough but it is mark’s style of writing that really brings it to life as brutal as he can be i really enjoy being inside jorg’s head and the thing i like most about king of thorns is that we’re inside it a whole lot more than we were in prince of thorns i really liked the way he would talk to the reader and give us his personal views/theories on the
6688,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,3,i really enjoyed the first book in this series but i struggled through the first half of this second volume i found myself skimming sections that just didn t interest me very much i usually end up dropping the book after i start that but i hung on because of my enjoyment of the previous book and in the end it did turn around i thought the writing in the first book was lean and crisp but there felt like quite a bit of filler through the beginning of book two i don t have a problem with a narr
6689,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,3,this really wasn t that amazing there was no plot only endless traveling all the characters were bland and absolutely indistinguishable from each other and it was mostly just boring as fuck still i give it num stars because it had some tiny parts i liked and the world building is good though it didn t really show in this one also am i the only one who is really annoyed at how there s always this brilliant magical object that the characters just happen to have and that always saves them
6690,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,i had to grind this one out because for me wedding day was far more interesting than four years ago and there seemed to be far more of the less preferred story line to read the ending made it all worthwhile though and the hard slog paid off i basically moved straight onto this from the first although i will have a break before beginning book three i feel like my brain needs a bit of a refresh so i m reading something completely different now i did adore the big battle scenes especial
6691,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,five stars for sure mark only went and made this better than the first somehow had me laughing out loud more and feeling for characters more jorg has grown as a character and i really liked reading that full of surprises and i cannot wait to pick up the next 
6692,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,i read first part many many years ago and then didn t know where to find the sequels and i m glad i did king of thorns is just so good dark and jorg is very unique character and something about this makes me think of assassin s creed num num/num
6693,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,i very rarely leave reviews as prefer to read my words than write them but this book is amazing honest gritty dark and totally engrossing every character fully written as good as the first book maybe better either way both books are amazing can t recommend enough

6698,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5, i had wanted my uncle s blood his crown i took because other men said i could not have it the odds are incredibly against king jorg the stakes are high and the plot twists are indescribable he killed his worthless uncles and secured a small kingdom in the mountains but he now has to face a pompous enemy namely the prince of arrow we go back and forth in time just like number one from jorg s wedding day/war that has come to four years earlier we get to see how jorg traveled the empire and
6699,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,i immensely enjoyed this book and now that i m finished with it i wish i had the third book to read right now the first book was an amazing start but i found this book to be so much better it s really masterfully constructed and incredibly well written this novel s structure is similar to the prince of thorns where a half or so of the book takes place in the present and half takes place a certain amount of years in the past in this book however i found it to be much more successful an

6704,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,honorous jorg ancrath was introduced in the book prince of thorns it was very hard to like him he associated with the worst possible crowd his methods were beyond questionable the word ‘fair’ does not exist in his dictionary committing atrocities around the hundred kingdoms was the least of his flaws but jorg ancrath is a very complicated character his past is scarred with thorns that has chosen the path he walks intelligent charming and ruthless are just a glimpse of his qualities for
6705,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,one of my favourite books of num was mark lawrence s debut novel prince of thorns while hotly debated and often maligned for it supposed misogyny i found lawrence s story of this black hearted prince and the forces that made him who he was and which manipulate his actions still fascinating not only did lawrence tell a fantastic story he also told it in wonderful prose unsurprisingly i was looking forward to reading king of thorns which however i didn t get to read until this past week 
6706,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,i love mark lawrence s writing dark characters with equally dark philosophy the story unfolds almost like a stream of consciousness including lots of flashbacks if that is possible it is a fatalistic type of story telling all of the characters seem sharply aware of who they are and what end is likely to await them life just is there isn t any noble motives or care for others because in the end none of it matters jorg is bad he uses his friends and allies almost without thought he mostly
6708,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,the masterpiece that is prince of thorns continues on in a sequel that truly delivers on all expectations set before it i ve read a lot of reviews of this book that almost unanimously claim that king of thorns is much better than it s predecessor i actually think i am going to have to disagree but perhaps for different reasons obviously the plot and characters thicken quite nicely in kot and really i couldn t ask for a better sequel but there are two reasons that i enjoyed pot just that li

6711,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,actual review num num i am in awe literally my jaw dropped and i stared at this book because it was amazing the only thing that has stopped me from giving it a perfect score is the fact that the first half of the book moved too slow for my liking the latter half of this book however… wow warning there is an explicit dog torture scene in this book for those who are squeamish ☹ is this going to be one of those times when you pretend not to have a plan until the last moment and then turn out
6713,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,the guy who wrote this is on par with martin can go screw himself because this is better i found these pages scattered teased across the rocks by a fitful wind in my previous review i stated that i hate hate hate mark lawrence that hate has turned into something far worse and far deadlier after reading the king of thorns because no one should write this good and live i led my bride from the chapel with the applause and hoorahs of the nobility ringing behind us almost but not quite dr
6714,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,drink to forget open to remember and slice to end a review of king of thorns by mark lawrence in most things lack of accuracy does not make a lie i could say that honorous jorg ancrath is an anti hero it would be true though inaccurate i could write that mark lawrence once more trumped the stereotypes of fantasy i m used to it would still be inaccurate but true i could even say that king of thorns is just a sequel to prince of thorns and it would be truly inaccurate king of thorns in many
6715,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,reviewing the second entry in a series is tricky business with a book that blew me away like prince of thorns there is a tendency to expect a similar experience from its sequel which is sort of unfair if you think about it this is especially so in the case of pot because part of the joy of it was how incredibly surprising it was almost regardless of what you know going in lawrence shatters your expectations immediately uses one of the shards to stab you in the gut then twists and digs i
6716,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5,there s a lot going on with king of thorns that begs me to go back and read it again soon firstly hats off to mark lawrence for juggling a non linear story structure we follow jorg on his wedding day when he goes toe to toe with the golden boy the prince of arrow who s set to become the emperor or at least that s what everyone keeps saying we simultaneously also follow the events that happened to jorg four years ago as he settles in his position of king of renar the jorg we follow in boo
6717,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,3,jorg is back for more in king of thorns he has avenged himself on the people most responsible for the brutal murder of his mother and brother in the process he won himself a kingdom albeit small in king of thorns the story continues this time jorg is fighting against all odds and against the natural human instinct to survive compromise and in general get along to retain that kingdom the charismatic prince of arrow seems destined to re unite the empire and end the hundred war only jorg
6718,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,2,i know that a lot of fans are going to think i’m batshit crazy for not enjoying king of thorns especially considering the fact that i love the whole “grimdark” scene this is the subgenre that i’ve grown up with and i adore it and i hope that it never goes away i’ve braced myself for the hate coming my way so come on fanboys/girls hit me with your best shot the strange thing about this series is the marketing behind it everything about it really screams “game of thrones/medieval fantasy” a
6719,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,5, ubdate second read even better than the first i like dark and gritty books just like chocolate the darker the better i m not sure what does that say about my character i m not a violent person i m actually against violence in all forms and shapes but when it comes to books this series is the bitterest chocolate i ve ever tried now i feel nauseated for comparing those books to chocolate i ve read prince of thorns as soon as it was published mostly i was attracted to the cover 
6720,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,hang a sock over your moral compass and just enjoy the ride jorg the protagonist of this second book in the series is still a gleeful maniac that said he s mellowed in this book into someone recognizably human he is still cold blooded about hurting people but he also shows real human vulnerability and wisdom and he tends to only hurt those who are arguably fair game so it s easier to stay on side with him jorg remains a smart smart mouthed and audacious protagonist and this novel fea
6722,King of Thorns,Mark  Lawrence,4,my review of king of thorns it s good read it now unless you haven t read prince of thorns read that first then read this one now why i like it everything you read about mark lawrence s broken empire is that it s dark that it s deep deep hole of base emotions and actions i can see why people say that and while i see it in the book s i also see an explanation of the why and how of it s plausibility jorg lives in a world that doesn t reward anything but what can be taken whether

6726,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,when the majority of individuals think about stephen king s credentials it is generally about his amazing work rate at producing memorable and top quality horror stories with that in mind in addition to the dark tower saga this novel is one of mr king s lesser known creations that is definitely more tolkien than tommyknockers it is an easy story to get into and i was intrigued from the first page my grandfather gave me this book when i was a wide eyed eleven year old lover of goosebumps b
6727,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,num num stars hands down this is my favorite stephen king book i m not saying this is his best piece of work but personal preferences n all this is just what i happen to enjoy the most so erica has a stellar review that explains why this book should be revered above all other king books and also touches another review that is total crap written by a man who can normally be counted on to give good book recommendations even though he tends to ramble and add musical lyrics to all his reviews a
6728,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,when i was a little girl my mother and father would tuck me in at night and read me a bedtime story at christmas and easter i would have the pleasure of listening to bedtime stories made up by my father just for me delee the adventures of the pink kitty about a very special kitten making his way to a very special child and his adventures along the way trying to find a home with the perfect little girl me it wasn t a logical story it probably wasn t the best story out there but
6729,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,napkins napkins and more than enough too much nose picking and boogers stephen “i dressed up like jack vance for halloween” king made a noteworthy switch from straight up horror to a better than passable high fantasy in his num novel the eyes of the dragon the king of american horror though is also a better than average writer and knows a thing or two about moving some copy and though this is a little out of character like henry fonda in once upon a time in the west it is also entertainin
6730,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4, book you have the right to a speedy trial review the defense he may have switched from horror to fantasy with this one but stephen king s trademark gripping prose is still in full force a scene stealing villain who creates chaos and is just so much fun to watch flagg would fit right in at gotham city despite the fantasy setting the emotions of the characters always feel real king takes some narrative risks that really pay off the segments told through the pov of a dog are
6731,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,2,at its time of publication way back in num the eyes of the dragon was a bit of a departure from stephen king’s typical horror fare i wouldn’t say it was his first venture into the fantasy genre per se considering the iconic gunslinger the first of the dark tower books was released a few years prior to this one but i do believe it was his first attempt at a novel length fairy tale it makes perfect sense that king would dedicate this story to his daughter considering the cutesy feel to i
6732,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,i need to preface this by saying that this was the first stephen king book i ever read he is my father s favorite author and i grew up staring at the dozens of hardback books all in a row on the shelves of his office all with king s name on them i really wanted to read one see what it was dad read and the reason he handed me this one was the same reason king wrote it so his kids could read something he had written in other words it s kid friendly and actually written as a children s bo
6733,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,i read this about ten years ago and just read the book again about two years ago well i m delighted to say that it still has all its magic as an aspiring writer i was breaking down the story trying to figure out what made it special it s not so much the setting as there are many fairy tale legends which are similar to this one nor is it the actual idea as many good princes have been unjustly imprisoned and then tried to redeem themselves later this tale s strength is in its narrative p
6734,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3, num num a buddy read with my fairy tales loving friends at bb b i have never jumped on the steven king fan band wagon but it was never because of his writing it usually relates to the thematics and my inability to cope with thrillers and imaginative mind which brings all his monsters to life and i just can t deal however this book is not his usual fair it is a fairytale and i am a humongous fan of anything resembling a classic fairytale or fantasy so this is how several

6738,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,to me it s pretty interesting that my favorite stephen king book is not horror at all but rather fantasy it makes sense really i don t enjoy reading about people being tormented and murdered i like to read about people overcoming their fears and the villains they encounter in life so it was nice to read a story by king in a setting i love fairy tale land this is a fairy tale with all the usual trappings and he does a great job with it i think this story really shows what a good write
6739,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,well that was different well written of course it wasn t bad at all just not what i was expecting or really wanted see king s reaction to that view below if we all would have loved this one we would have missed out miserably perhaps i would have rated it higher if i knew what was coming or what age group this is really written for or if i was extremely ill in bed slurping down chicken soup and my mom came in to read it to me and blush at the mention of the king s iron hmmmm 
6740,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,once upon a time in the kingdom of delain far away seriously why didn t this book started that way i can hear someone in the background barfing at the cheesiness of it but this chick right here lives for that kind of beginning in fairytales especially in a stephen king s book the eyes of the dragon is all things fantasy something i have never read from the king of horror it s always a big fun to read an author stepping out of his usual comfort zone and king nailed it this book may

6742,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,this is one of stephen king s fantasy offerings and it is quite delightful i do not always enjoy adult fairy stories but this one catches you up into the action and there is nowhere to go except to read and enjoy the whole book the way the story is told is quite original the chapters are all different lengths sometimes just one paragraph sometimes a normal length quite often the author lets the reader know what is going to happen and then goes back to fill in on how it came about that way
6743,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,2,i understand that this was many readers first king book i understand that this book rests in the hearts of thousands i understand this is meant to be a fairytale and that i am not the target audience i understand all that and i still choose to hate this book how d bobby brown put it it s my prerogative the eyes of the dragon was slightly more bearable this go around because laddie from perfect strangers read it to me and i highly suggest you take the same route when/if you decide to
6744,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5, i think that real friendship always makes us feel such sweet gratitude because the world almost always seems like a very hard desert and the flowers that grow there seem to grow there against such high odds a beautiful ya fantasy novel focusing on the tale of king roland of delain and his two sons peter and thomas with the story being told by an unknown narrator king roland is killed by an unusual poison with his son peter being accused of murder and imprisoned at the top of a high tower
6745,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,this seems to be one of those books that people either love or hate—how strange to find myself right in the middle i’ve never been one of king’s constant readers and have only read a few of his books over the last number of years this one is written very much in the form of a fairy tale and is dedicated to his daughter who may have heard the first versions of it as bedtime material i was disappointed that the dragon of the title was only a mounted head on the wall—live dragons are much more
6746,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,please note the rating above is a spite rating though in all honesty i d have given this all the stars in num too however i am spiting jeff whose opinion is horrible and should be rectified with electro shock therapy or something interestingly i m stealing my review from a comment i made in another of his s king threads this is all getting very meta comment/review aww man i loved the eyes of the dragon it pissed my mom right off though she got it when it came out and was expecting
6747,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,probably king’s most atypical novel a fairytale style story about two brothers disputing over the throne in a vague kingdom where the power is manipulated byt the evil wizard flagg not much reminds us that we are reading a book by stephen king here there’s flagg who is the most memorable part of this book and then there are of course those boogers… it is told by a narrator from our time which at times feels a bit askew the story has some nuance and atmosphere some parts hold together well
6749,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,i really missed out reading this book when i was num king packed this baby with all of the tropes ya fiction should contain and made a fun page turning novel even if we know how everything is going to turn out the snarky narrator is an extra bonus and how cool is it that he wrote this book for his daughter he even gave a character in the book her name did he win father of the year when this was first published 
6750,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,interesting and slightly odd mixture of stephen kings story telling and a slightly more classic/mythological tale than we re used to from the modern prince of horror this is described by some as stephen king doing children s literature well i wouldn t really call it that i m aware that mr king dedicated this to his daughter but i would suggest that you read it yourself first before giving it to a child at least a child younger than say num just my opinion it s how i d handle it the sto
6751,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,well this was a really quick read for me i remembered liking this one from the first time that i read it but i didn t remember the storyline at all it turned out to be one of those stories that i just didn t want to put down for long eyes of the dragon is very different from most of king s other works written for his tween age daughter because she complained that he had not written anything that she was interested in or felt comfortable reading the eyes of the dragon is basically king s t
6752,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,2,the single worst stephen king novel i have ever read and this man has written his fair share of turds 
6755,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,this is still one of my favourite king books a whimsical fairy tale set in a magical landscape a dark tower for younger readers if you will i couldn t quite give it five stars this time around since it s not as epic or grand as something like the talisman but my sheer enjoyment of the story has not diminished with the years king weaves a truly engaging spell with this one which prominently features the uber villainous flagg who has shown up in many king novels sometimes under other na

6757,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,i read that this is a story that king told to his children when they were young if so it makes perfect sense the tone of the narrator is patient he never asks that his readers make any kind of leap across difficult concepts instead he leads us slowly and carefully through the events that mark the dangerous passage from the reign of roland the good to that of his son king peter in spite of the wicked plottings and murderous acts of the royal magician flagg in other words folks this is a f

6763,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,i love everything about this book and always have the fact that it was written for king’s daughter naomi is so incredibly sweet throw in the fact that a strong and important female character is named after her and you have a heart tugging situation now on to the actual story so so good i read somewhere that this was originally entitled napkins i think that was a better title but i digress this is an adult fairy tale not because there is anything inappropriate about it but because it’s

6781,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,2,num num/num there is something that some authors who usually write for adults do sometimes when they are writing for a younger audience and that is that they clearly write for a younger audience this book had some of that sing songy tone to it that adults sometimes use with children when they re sort of talking down to them that whole now pay attention boys and girls while we see the big bad magician trick the silly people it s annoying and it makes me want to almost mark this book as j
6782,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,the eyes of the dragon was written for a different audience than the one king usually writes for i was fine with that for most of the book until the pages leading up to the ending it was a suitable ending but it fell a little flat with me i wouldn t consider this a spoiler just my opinion what had been a fairly solid nicely spun tale ended up with some holes in the yarn other than that the book was enjoyable and the ending was fine just lacking king managed to craft a fairy tale with ho
6783,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,at times king s approach to writing from a storyteller s perspective is a little cloying and there s a lot of old fashioned narrator presence in this one i m sorry to say it s not for me to tell you ll have to make up your mind to me this stuff is cute in very small doses but betrays a little too much the mechanics behind writing itself it s difficult to get really lost in a story when the author continually reminds you that it s a story other than that this is a good adventure y

6786,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,with num books stephen king is most read author on my shelf yet i can t say i am a raging fangirl of his writing his novels sometimes work for me and sometime they don t but i keep reading him because you never know how his stories are going to end the eyes of the dragon is not a typical king s novel it reminded me more of a tale from some classic fantasy master like tolkien or beagle there is a kingdom in peril good prince and the evil wizard because of the lack of scary elements and the
6787,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,okay i haven t read this recently but just thought of it while writing the full dark no stars review i love this book to death although it s not anything like some of my other king favorites it the stand and is more fantasy based everything in this book just comes together so perfectly at the end i love the characters love the story i love the little illustrations that pop up now and then this is one of those books that i can pick up every few years and enjoy it just as much as

6792,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,the eyes of the dragon isn’t your usual stephen king novel for one thing it’s squarely in the young adult genre aside from an early reference to “the king’s iron ” a k a the royal penis the book is also relatively short clocking in at a modest for king num pages both traits impressed me changing your writing style is no easy thing but king does so skillfully using short punchy chapters and lean vocabulary to relate his fantasy of a kingdom thrown into turmoil by a devious magician w
6793,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,this is the first stephen king that i have ever read and having heard his reputation for writing horrific gory tales i was very much surprised at what i found this is an excellent story and it really shows king s abilities as a fantastic storyteller i am definately looking forward to reading more of his work there are many moments of high tension and unpredictable plots plenty of twists and turns the characters are engagable they give a clear feeling of whether you should love or hate th

6796,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,1,i m a huge stephen king fan but nothing is worse than bad stephen king as so often happens to ol stevie he took an idea that had enough material for a short story a prince is wrongly imprisoned for his father s murder and has to escape and drags it out to cover an entire book honestly the entire book would be the first twenty five pages of any other fantasy novel i read the book because many of the names were the same or echoes of characters in the dark tower series all was for naught a
6797,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,2,well it was not to be stronger than two stars upon my re read of this book some clever and some far fetched plot quirks does not help this fairy tale being more than it is it s not a hard read because it s well written but it s way dragged out if we for some reason would think it has some adult themes in it we can always rely on the bestest doggie in the world frisky just as good as a pink pony with stars in the mane

6801,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,imagine having a bedtime story by stephen king the eyes of the dragon is the closest thing readers are going to that experience coming off his ultimate masterpiece of horror it king tries something he hasn t done before in his career while it was an adult novel driven by child characters the eyes of the dragon was a children s book with adult themes a risky move by king as well as removing his reputation as a horror author by creating a purely fantastical novel i think it can be
6802,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,the eyes of the dragon is a stephen king that slipped past my notice in the num s probably because it was fantasy and i was in a snooty collegiate phase at the time thinking pynchon god because well he was often near impossible to follow heck i d even disavowed king s early works which i d love in high school like the stand and the shining as schlock typical snotty late adolescent though i did read and loved it one summer break a guilty pleasure lucky for me i got older no
6804,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,having read the stand last summer i was surprised to encounter a familiar villain in the eyes of the dragon randall flagg in this story he appears as an evil magician bent on inciting destruction and violence in the kingdom of delain we begin with the stories of king roland and queen sasha building up to the births of their two sons peter the noble heir to the throne and thomas the cowardly and underappreciated younger brother when flagg plots an assassination against the king the two b
6805,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,this book was okay i dnfed it at num this was my first stephen king novel i ve read a couple of his short stories previously but none of his longer works i really tried to read this but i would think that i should try to read a little bit of this and feel an aversion and i m not going to force myself through a book i m not liking i did enjoy parts of it but dennis is simply very boring to me i also hated the gender roles enforced in this book and only let them slide as this was written
6806,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4, i think that real friendship always makes us feel sweet gratitude because the world almost always seems like a very hard desert and the flowers that grow there seem to grow against such high odds the road to hell is paved with good intentions but he also knew that for human beings good intentions are sometimes all there are angels may be safe from damnation but human beings are less fortunate things and for them hell is always close stephen king and fantasy surely you jest i know at
6807,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,this is my second read of this book i read it the first time about num years ago the kingdom of delain is ruled peacefully by king roland and his two sons peter and thomas but when king roland suddenly dies of a strange and evil poison his son peter is blamed for the murder and sentenced to live the rest of his life in a tall tower called the needle king roland s assistant flagg is an evil magician who wants to topple the entire kingdom as thomas deals with his own guilt surrounding rolan
6808,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,this is my third stephen king but i’ve been told it’s not typical i don’t think my others num/num/num and joyland were typical either i started this with some apprehension as fantasy is not usually my genre and i had chosen to read this because i needed a book with a dragon for a particular challenge but i was pleasantly surprised it’s written in the style of a fairytale although at num pages it’s a little longer than your average fairytale i got caught up in the story found the charac
6809,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,not only have i read this book num times i own it because it is one of my favorites stephen king is the kind of guy who can write about anything the sorcerer in this story is none other than randall flagg since this is medieval fantasy it shows that the dark man is eternal my copy of this book is very old and has beautiful drawings of the dragon there is a peep hole through the dragon s eye used for spying on members of the royal family eavesdropping is not a new concept randall flagg is a
6810,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,while not the most original plot or intricately woven world stephen king has a way of telling a story that makes it hard to put down anything he writes including his mostly successful attempt at the fantasy genre the eyes of the dragon one thing i am very curious about is whether j k rowling read this which was first published in num right before she wrote the harry potter series i say this because of the stinging number of similarities i found in the two works a teenage boy protagonist
6811,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,i was waiting for a dragon well without spoiling it…you’ll see for yourself if there are dragons or not but if you love fairy tales and all things kings and evil magicians and king court politics and intrigue and napkins yes napkins then dive in i haven’t even noticed how i swallowed this book king has this effect on readers doesn’t he a few hours later you look up and wonder “where am i ”
6814,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,another book i really need to re read so i can fully appreciate the dark tower connection i loved this story because it was different and my first dabble into king s fantasy i honestly don t remember much of the actual story now but i do remember enjoying it immensely and how it kept me captivated from start to finish personally i think it s one of king s more underrated novels 
6816,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,this is definitely one of stephen king s better novels i listened to it in audio and the narrator did a fabulous job of bringing this fairytale to life what can i say the child in me loved it 
6817,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,very different for a stephen king book but i loved everything about it especially the end where thing s aren t completely resolved so it leaves it open for another story maybe if you like stephen king this is a must read to show just how versatile a writer he really is 
6818,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,radically different than any other stephen king work eyes of the dragon is a fantasy book set in a medieval world in a fictional kingdom it starts slow but the pace changes as it progresses subtly transforming from a children s book into what could be considered a young adult one judging by the phrasing and the educational vibe it emits it s clearly targeted at children nevertheless some of the character names are those of already established famous stephen king characters such as rol
6819,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,i read this for two reasons num it s the only time stephen king has written out and out straight up high fantasy num it s got randall flagg overall this was lovely if not super arch it s got kings and princes and a court magician and a dragon and tall towers and castles such that it makes me evaluate how much we actually need stories that are so down the middle tropey with regards to fantasy where it succeeded was in the telling of it king is a hell of a storyteller and can weave a hell of a
6820,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,all of king s style is here but kid friendly it was amazing simply put i loved all the references that i caught i read this only to make sure it was suitable for a num year old and i m happy i finally picked up this masterpiece i think it ll be a great start for a younger generation s relationship with king and for the constant reader it sure ticked off a lot of reasons as to why i love king to begin with 
6822,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,an amazingly written fantasy story 👌 i loved the friendship and the loyalty between peter ben and dennis a pretty enjoyable read 🌌👍🐉👑
6824,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,i read that this book was one of the inspirations for king to write misery as a lot of fans were mad at him for writing something that wasn’t horror i think this story is proof that king can write so much more than horror and it still be a damn good story i think that quote about friendship is going to stick with me for awhile i’m still kicking myself my having not read this earlier in life i think i would’ve loved the hell out of this story in high school and i may have become a constant re
6826,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,1,i haven t in the rereading of king s work read his collaboration with peter straub as yet i m saving the talisman and black house along with the dark tower series until the end i consider the talisman to be his first misstep the first time i read something by him and was disappointed but i d put it down to the perenially disappointing peter straub yeah yeah yeah i know i know he s good blah blah blah i do not like his stuff get over it but with this book king officially produced
6827,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,this was quite a captivating read though i have mixed feelings about it hence the num stars i liked the story but it was not very complex and from the start we know the general outline of what will happen the narrator who makes his presence known with various comments tells us from the start what the main event of the book is though at the time i didn t know that the book wasn t going to go much further than this i liked this on the whole and found the narration fun and cozy to li

6831,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,i don t think i have ever come away from a stephen king book and thought delightful yet that was the case here this book had passed me by and i picked it up recently since it was on sale and sounded interesting enough this novel is more straight forward fantasy but with a quest or a long winded adventure instead there is a focused narrow story arc involving the king and his two sons betrayal and then seeking for justice yet not a self serving justice tainted with revenge but a thirst fo
6832,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,more of a num num this is my first stephen king book i ve bought a lot of his books before thick ones with small font sizes but i ve never gotten around to read them i d read the first num pages then give up lol so when a friend of mine forwarded this to me saying a tv series will be produced from it i thought why not give it a try especially since they say that it s a dumbed down version of what he usually writes and i liked it i did with a few exemptions the storytelling was unique
6833,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,stephen king for kids yeah sometimes eyes of the dragon is as close as king comes to being for all ages this is a shift from most of king s other writings but carries much of king s traditional thematic and style stephen king s world is connected to our own and it s in that world that all his stories hang out blending together in fascinating and engaging ways one can t help but see the connections in dragon to other books the stand it the dark tower maybe it s just that i really like
6834,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,this is one of my favorite stephen king books of all time i was an avid stephen king fan at an inappropriately young age and devoured every one of his books i could get my hands on the eyes of the dragon was purchased for me by a family member for my numth birthday as a more age appropriate book because he had written it for his daughter when she was young so she could read her dad s work it is by far less gory and dark than his regular works but even as a die hard fan i would not recommend
6835,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,between the scattered pictures throughout the story and the easy concepts and vocabulary the eyes of the dragon seems like it is a children s book while the book is devoid of stephen king s patented terror it s still chock full of his wry humor and warped mind this is definitely not for the little ones the eyes of the dragon takes place in the same world as stephen king s dark tower series and was the first book he published that was completely apart from the horror genre the title mentions
6836,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,oddly enough this is the only stephen king i have ever read i keep telling myself i will read others but obviously i have a lot of things i want to read when i think of this book i think the ultimate fairy tale okay there is not really romance but still there is something so wonderful about the imperfect king the benevolent queen and all the tiny details that make up this story i don’t think this story belongs exclusively to peter or anyone the magician flagg has been plotting the downfa
6838,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,i didn t expect i would like this one because i m not a fan of fantasy novels nor do i like it when stephen king writes something for his children this was written for his daughter because you know its going to be a pretty tame read as far as violence and horror goes but while i was a quarter way through this it suddenly dawned on me that i was enjoying the book it s very simply written and there isn t anything particularly scary or intriguing about it but all the same it is very entert
6839,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,this one s very fun it s aimed at a younger sort of audience i think than stephen king s other stuff like the stand so the tone is quite light i like the narrative style the storyteller flavour of it the story itself is quite simple really and quite fairytale ish but the little details are really awesome the things that are mentioned early on and later become relevant such as the doll s house i found the presence of flagg interesting too it s nothing terribly substantial and t
6840,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,this book was for me an easy and enjoyable read i liked the bits when the author spoke to me the reader the ending was rather predictable i read the kindle edition and was surprised by the misspelled words often delain the kingdom was detain and doll house became do// house perhaps that was a product of the process of making the book into a e book there seems to have been difficulty with the letter l so i liked it but wasn t all that impressed with my second stephen king book it s n
6841,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,i remember reading this in one sitting about ten years ago and loving it in this very particular fairy talesque setting stephen king does a great job of narrating the heroic adventures of prince peter who assumes the throne of his late father king roland as the story unfolds many amazing characters are introduced flagg as a villainous magician some of them will try to overthrow peter a greatly underrated book 
6842,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,i remember reading this book years ago before i even knew who stephen king was i came across it at our high school library and thought it sounded interesting as a fantasy lover i was excited to reading this fairytale like book i m glad i did it was very good and i wish that he would write more fantasy stories the story really pulled me in and left me wanting to know what would happen next if you are a fantasy lover i would highly recommend giving this book a try 
6843,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,when stephen king s daughter naomi was young she had never read any of his books because she didn t like horror he wrote this story for her so she could read one of his books it s quite different from his other books because it s written more for children and because it s sort of a fantasy/adventure story rather than horror there s plenty of magic and suspense and his exceptional storytelling skills are just as evident here 
6844,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,i don t think that they called them ya books back in num but back then spinning this fantasy tale for his daughter i m sure she was more then pleased with this tale adventurous young hero s trying to save the young king a wicked old magician trying to keep him from being the new king with the wonderful descriptions of the landscape and the feel of that cold and drafty castle this was a fun yarn recommended reading for young fantasy fans 
6846,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,i read it a long time ago it d be refreshing to read it again a unique tale with all the classic items fully mastered twisted updated num num i have read a lot of fantasy books since then so i guess it s normal that it didn t impressed me as much as younger but i really like it and i m glad of rereading it again with a few archetypical characters stephen king has mastered an incredible bedtime read for children and a delightful and fast fantasy read for grown ups 
6847,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,this is my second stephen king and very happy to find out that he s not just write horror stories the eyes of the dragon really hooked me up good this book will have connection with the dark tower they said definitely gonna be on my tbr as king said on the last page of this book but now the hour is late and all of that us another tale for another day 
6848,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,1,i m not sure whether king was writing this one for kids or not if so maybe kids would like it i thought it was very poor i really can t get into king s fantasy without the horror backbone his work seems too fluffy 
6849,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,the story was entertaining but i m just not a huge fan of traditional/medieval style fantasy so it didn t really captivate my imagination i just had it so i read it the story was left open for a sequel at the end anyone know if a sequel was ever written

6854,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,perched in their ivory towers and condemning any literature that does not meet their predefined requirements for excellence those requirements being obfuscation and inaccessibility the fiercest critics have had a lot to say about the writing of stephen king he has been described by some as an inadequate writer of nothing more than penny dreadfuls one who shares nothing in common with literary giants like dickens and poe speaking of his early work peter straub summarised the views of the l
6855,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,i wrote a longer review on my wordpress site but i get a little side tracked discussing the difference between author blinders and artistic context so here s a cut and paste of the more book specific part of my review what you can expect from the eyes of the dragon is a predictable ya fantasy set up royal family one distant parent another dead two brothers one the hero and one isn’t one royal adviser who seemingly spends all their free time rubbing their hands together in a corner cackl

6859,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,king s foray into fantasy is cliched and predictable the book is short and sweet good for a quick read but nothing that ll stay back with you the story follows the royal family of delain king roland who reminded me a lot of king robert baratheon of asoiaf fame his good queen sasha their sons peter and thomas and last but not the least the magician flagg flagg isn t a new character for a king reader we ve met him has the walking dude the one who walks among the corns randall flagg an
6861,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,the eyes of the dragon is the book that inspired stephen king to write misery it s actually a double bind some people were expecting horror from king even though up to this point in his career he had a pretty diverse output others still may have expected that the eyes of the dragon would have more actual fantasy elements instead we have a tale of courtly intrigue and the unbreakable bonds of friendship a breezy read told in a more conversational register than we re used to where years

6870,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,delain a symphonic metal band i listen to from the netherlands took their name from a stephen king book this is that book i never bothered to look it up and now i know one of the quicker reads by mr king this one read like a children s fairy tale nice change from most of his other books flagg is in this one being very flaggish there was also a character named roland who is not at all like the other roland no complaints from start to finish though i wish the ending was extended a bi
6871,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,this fairy tale had a bit of everything that makes a good fairy tale an evil wizard a noble prince loyal friends etc it is a story about good versus evil and how evil can use good people for their evil purposes i enjoyed reading it although there were some times that the story lagged a bit in the middle i found myself routing for the good guys but perhaps peter was a little too good and cheering when things didn t go the bad guy s way the best characters were the flawed ones but i al
6873,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,it seems i had such good luck with audiobooks this week this had just one narrator as oppossed to the half a dozen sleeping giants had but was just as effective he didn t overdo his accents but was successful when he did them he had this great menacing voice for flagg that at the same time reminded me of benedict cumberbatch s smaug dracula from penny dreadful alan rickman s snape ralph fiennes s voldemort especially that whispery bit in the last movie when he s in everyone s heads i m so
6874,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,i have a confession to make i ve never read a stephen king novel before i ve read several of his essays and been quite impressed but i m just not a fan of horror as a genre but i do love a good fantasy or a twisted fairy tale which is precisely what we have in the eyes of the dragon and it s delightful the plot is simple an evil magician murders the king frames the crown prince and then proceeds to install the younger prince as king a king whom the evil magician can control but
6875,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,oh king why you do this why you try to take on an old and dated style and try to play in that world when it is most definitely not your world heck you even throw in an allusion one that others may not catch but i read stephen crane s poetry and you quoted from what may be in the top ten most well known of his poems to remind us hey i m stephen king and this is what i do see hey guys this is an illusion this all takes place in the realm of all stories wait don t walk away lo
6876,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,num num stars those of you who know me are aware that i m a huge king fan if i weren t i never would ve picked this novel up never would ve experienced the captivating power that the story of delain holds i m sure glad i did those of you who know me also know that i am not typically not a fan of fantasy although i ve read my share of it over the years that was one reason i wasn t looking forward to reading this one the other reason was that i didn t read anything that intrigued me in the syno
6879,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,i re read this book to check if it was suitable for my num year old daughter to read it s sometimes referred to as stephen king for children but on re read i find that s not really true there is some pretty direct sexual euphemisms at the beginning how the king s sword hardened before the queen s forge frank talk about how babies get made allusions to sexual violence but more than that you can t really tone down stephen king s zeal for murder torture and mayhem the bad guy is real
6880,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,2,why i read stephen king when usually i am disappointed the result is usually a two it intrigues interests intimidates me that he can write virtually anything and it appeals to an extensive readership this is his attempt to self consciously model something of fantasy but the lack i feel is perhaps easily noted magic is missing not simply in the narrative where what little magic deployed seems momentarily useful for political ends but magic is also missing in any literary sense the
6881,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,i revisited this old friend for perhaps the numrd or fourth time recently as always stephen king is a master of creating a desire to turn yet another page to read on just a bit more this time around however i noticed afresh the strong connections to the dark tower series while neither the knowledge or ignorance of the dark tower will adversely affect the reader s delight in going through this tale i did find that i spent more time wondering and thinking about the other much later roland
6882,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,i ve always been jealous of people who remember their childhood well i can hardly recall even a few things i enjoyed doing when i was a child i do however remember how i used to read the books i liked at night hiding under the blanket so my parents wouldn t have noticed one of these books was stephen king s the eyes of the dragon i find it s funny that i m doing the very same thing now and though it s not by far as thrilling as it was with my parents constantly trying to catch me it s
6883,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,i have to confess this is the fourth time i ve read this book i first read it back in the nums when i was kid how i miss the nums and i loved it then and i love it now it was the first stephen king book i ever read definitely not the last although i didn t return to him properly until much later in life mine and his only king could write a story where the narrator is so present so heavy and make it all the more fulfilling because of it plus flagg for me is one of the best cha
6884,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,one of my top three stephen king favorites this story is so unlike his usual horror theme this one is very reminiscent of neil gaiman s fantasy stories in which an evil wizard tries to bring death and destruction to the kingdom the story begins with king roland and how he managed to sire two sons even though he wasn t fond of women and the whole procreation process the brothers peter and thomas are complete opposites and since the queen died giving birth to thomas they grew up with a riva
6885,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,stephen king wrote this book to apease his daughter who was frightened by his other more grouesome novels she liked when he would make up bedstories for her and this was the ultimate bedtime story it had knights and kings and princes and dragons and evil secrets i read this many many years ago and thought this was one of kings greatest novels ever still to this date excellent writing and interesting as he never wrote another like it in all the following years bravo on the fa
6886,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,this is a reread from high school that was sadly far too many years ago still highly enjoyable the gradual buildup to the conclusion will definitely wear on your nerves encompassing several assassinations a royal prince wrongly accused and an demon sorceror hell bent on seeing his wretched evil plans brought to fruition the driving force of this book is how in the world will justice be served never fear things might not always go as one would think but many wrongs are righted very sati
6887,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,i wouldn t know this was a stephen king book if his name wasn t on the cover the light hearted jaunty story telling was surprising from him not a whole lot happens in the plot and i almost predicted exactly what happened however when i was fourteen i would have loved this story as an adult i only like it as a fantasy novel its okay i have certainly read better but its much nicer than i expected it to be its a light hearted easy read however if you want a light hearted action filled fanta
6889,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,i didn t know uncle stevie had it in him to be this charming this is a traditional fantasy story almost a fairy tale which means i m already inclined to love it anyway with some king style added in there for good measure talkative narrator great eye for details and use of motifs character depth in unexpected places also the eyes of the dragon did not turn out to be what i expected them to be which made me absurdly happy for some reason really really enjoyed this one it s like a h
6890,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,i m not sure why i hadn t read this book sooner as stephen king is one of my favorite authors this was an enjoyable fairy tale type story of evil plots jealousy and a wrongly imprisoned prince was it my favorite work of mr king s no but it was a great example of the type of stories he can weave that draw the reader in however i much prefer the other saga featuring a roland and flagg num reading challenge category a book that was published more than num years ago 
6891,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,my first ever stephen king book i read as a kid and still my very favorite it s a quick read it s magical suspenseful and narrated brilliantly by bronson pinchot he has the creepiest most perfect flagg voice ever and embodied every character with distinction and clarity i m so glad i read this again and wanted to start it over as soon as it was done an absolute classic and unlike any other stephen king book you ll read 
6892,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,this book seemed to be aimed at a much younger audience than the author usually writes for i would estimate young adult perhaps even earlier it was an interesting book with a story that built up slowly perhaps too slowly but i was trying to keep in mind the audience level the climax was rather delicious but the resolution was over too quickly the one odd thing about the book was the complete lack of chapters 
6894,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,what can i say other than i thoroughly enjoyed this book the characters the story the whole shebang and the story it was a charming fairy tale written by the deliciously demented and mega talented stephen king and strangely it remained as just that a fairy tale frankly i kept waiting for the deaths and misery and scares galore they never came so so glad i picked up this book 
6897,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,i picked this book up as it was recommended to me by a member of a goodreads group i am active in i would not normally read much young adult fiction and although i have enjoyed the stephen king books i have read i wouldn t say i was a big fan needless to say i was quite apprehensive about picking this up but i m pleased i did as it was a thoroughly enjoyable read 
6899,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,stephen king is definitely one of the best at developing characters i enjoyed the good guys enjoyed the middle men and loathed the villain a very enjoyable shorter than usual for sk fantasy read 
6900,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,num num this book was written for king s num years old daughter because she haven t ready any of his books and liked fantasy with that in mind it is a pretty good book but not mutch profound aways use your napikins kids 
6901,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,2,too much fantasy too much fairytale and too much children s book my least favorite king the swedish translation enhances the children s book feel and so if you are a completist and are to read it i would strongly suggest the english version 
6902,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,a quick easy read also a pretty predictable story it has a few neat moments read this if you are trying to get all the extra story tidbits on the dark tower series recommended
6903,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,listened to the audio version of the book and loved it my review is here http //rainydayreadingreviews blogspo 
6904,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,is there nothing this man can write about what a great story a fast read for all ages 
6905,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5, but now the hour is late and all of that is another tale for another day 
6906,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,this is ranked in my top three king books maybe number one i love every bit of this story i usually reread the eyes of the dragon yearly i highly suggest this for any reader king fan or not 
6907,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,this is a fun light read despite the author it s a great story of a kingdom and a magician pretty simple story but written in a narration style that was very entertaining
6908,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,2,think this was my first king in english i have it in swedish as well no matter what language i just can t get into the fairytale feel of this one 
6909,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,num num i ve read it in lithuanian and i have to say that translation was pretty weird to say the least anyway i kinda enjoyed this book though fantasy is not one of my favorite genres 
6910,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,great book it is a tie into with the stand and dark towers the villain flagg is in each story even though this is a ya book the story is delightful for all ages 
6911,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,fuck flagg tho
6912,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,i was finally able to start my goal of reading the dark tower series with this book i know this isn t technically part of the series but it serves as a type of prequel as it shares a villain with the series i was excited to get to this book so i was kind of disappointed that i didn t like it more there was nothing terribly bad about it but there also wasn t much that was terribly good i didn t connect to any of the characters and the writing style just didn t agree with me on the bright
6913,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,the eyes of the dragon exhibits stephen king at his most innocuous and least abbrasive level however this novel also seems to have lost a little bit of king s spirit in exchange for less graphic material for example in king s novel misery he fearlessly puts his characters through gore and profanity as well as sexual content and plaguing fears the eyes of the dragon appeals to a younger audience than king s other novels but the author is not totally out of his depth he busts out the mor
6914,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,the eyes of the dragon is decidedly a minor entry in stephen king s catalog of work and deservedly so it is apparently set in the same mid world as the dark tower series though generally has little actual connection to those longer and better books still eyes of the dragon has its own enjoyments as long you keep your expectations in check it s a fantasy novel with all the tropes that come with that designation dragons castles royalty magic king has dabbled occasionally in fantasy d
6915,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,this book was an interesting read because it was more like a piece of epic fantasy than a work of horror in fact king himself faced a backlash after the book was released and the subsequent furore inspired the plot of misery with annie’s obsession acting as a metaphor for his demanding dissatisfied readers it’s a shame because speaking personally i loved it in fact it’s refreshing to see king flexing a different set of authorial muscles and it certainly proved a point – the man knows
6917,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,sometimes you are surprised stephen king has long been associated with horror and deservedly so his career began with works like carrie christine firestarter the shining and so on all designed to scare the everlovin out of any poor soul who picked up the book and usually succeeding what s more the books often became movies thereby allowing that segment of the population who doesn t read much to be terrified so for years king has been called one of the scariest authors alive i ve se
6918,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,i am a die hard king fan some of his novels are in my top favorites the stand and the green mile to name two however the fantasy genre is my love and i do not believe that mr king owns this area of literature like he does horror if you want to label the majority of his work as such i have not enjoyed his gunslinger series nor the eyes of the dragon nearly as much as his other works they are pale comparisons to me of other novels in fantasy and of his other stories that being said 
6920,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,as an avid stephen king reader i was prepared to go on a reading marathon with the eyes of the dragon while having goosebumps from word after word but unexpectedly this book turned out to be something that in my opinion is completely different from stephen’s usual horror/thrillers it turned out to be set in a realm of fantasy having said that the eyes of the dragon was an easy story to get into and intriguing from the first page with its elaborate plot and well developed characters some
6921,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,this was stephen king s foray in to the genre of fantasy and he succeeded spectacularly this is a book that i ve put off reading because i didn t expect it to be very good i don t generally like fantasy because the characters are generally underdeveloped in favor of a strong complicated plot the main characters in this book were well developed the plot was strong but linear if you re a fan of the dark tower series this is a must read i listened to the audiobook version on overdrive from b
6922,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,it s getting close to num years since i last read this book as a fantasy obssessed teen moments came flooding back to me as i flew through this brief tale for moments are what king focused on most here it s almost a reader s digest version of an epic keeping the plot lean and the detail even leaner as we trip merrily through an awfully long period of time in a tidy length of most interest here is the character of flagg recognisable from the stand and elsewhere several large clues link him
6923,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,the eyes of the dragon is one of stephen kings first take on fairy tale and although it’s not a bad story and i did enjoy it it’s quite different from any other stephen king story and not because it’s fantasy but because it’s a fantasy story that reads like a storybook in fact i wouldn’t be surprised if the adaptation of this story was an animation rather than live action although it is a good story i feel like it just falls flat compared to to any of his other stories especially after re
6924,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,i really enjoyed this book it s certainly less creepy/horror based than his more well known works which some long time fans may not like for anyone who has been put off reading stephen king because of that though this would be a great place to start the tone of the story narration brought to mind a kindly storyteller by a fire and greatly reminded me of cs lewis that said this is probably not a book for younger children as there s just enough creepiness to remind you this is in fact st
6925,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,if you aren t a fan of this author s other books you should still check this one out it s sort of historical fantasy with a little of a fairytale feel maybe it is back in the times of ruling kings and has magicians and such i recommend it for all ages it s probably more of a young adult or maybe even middle grade it s a little harsher on everything not going perfectly compared to some middle grade books but it s definitely not like his adult horror i m enjoying how little bits of his boo
6926,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,i’ve probably read this book more times than any other it was my favorite story as a kid although it has been num years since i last read it it still gives me everything i could ask for from a standalone fantasy novel aimed at a younger reader there are many books that i remember as being “favorites” from the past but many times reading them years later you discover that nostalgia played a big part in your love for it so i was delighted to find that i still have crazy affection for this one
6927,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,i haven t read this since high school i enjoyed it but i can t decide if i like that it tries to be both epic and brief at the same time on the one hand it was a fun quick read that kept me engaged and that enjoyment might have been lost if it tried to be the lord of the rings on the other hand having enjoyed many books like the lord of the rings there were a lot of moments that i might have enjoyed a little more detail about as a result it did feel a little bit like a ya version of an epi
6928,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,more like a really long short story than a full blown novel the story is essential reading for fans of the stand and the the gunslinger series and maybe other books i have yet to read the book may also interest fans of other serial adventures the chapter illustrations castles wizards even a hero with a lightning bolt scar on his face king s influence is broad and deep 
6929,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,3,i enjoyed the story and the idea of it but the thing that threw me off the most was the writing style especially in the first half of the book he would tell you a major spoiler in his own way then proceed to go back in time and tell how it happened with the reader already knowing the result which can be alright for some people but not for me the second half was much better than the first half though and much more fast paced 
6931,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,5,an amazing fantasy tale full of murder sibling rivalry jealousy loyalty betrayal and much more anyone who knows me personally knows i am a huge stephen king fan and with that being said the eyes of the dragon is definitely one of my favorite novels of his king writes mostly of horror and supernatural but he is amazing at fantasy too i also love how this novel has a connection to the dark tower series and the stand because of the main villain and other little hints although this novel
6934,The Eyes of the Dragon,Stephen King,4,this was an interesting fantasy novel from stephen king it wasn t what i expected but i enjoyed it it had a lot of wit humor sarcasm napkins and boogers i could have done without the obsession on the last two items but it was still enjoyable nonetheless it was longer than it needed to be but i didn t think it dragged on too painfully my favorite part was the ending it was not what i was expecting but it made me think yeah right on king made the storyline work very well 
6935,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,a tale of a bond between humans and animals at its finest level fool’s errand is the first book in the tawny man trilogy—the third out of five subseries within hobb’s the realm of the elderlings gigantic series—and it is my favorite installment within the entire rote so far this is seriously a lovely memorable and poignant return to the world of fitz nighteyes and the fool’s journey honestly after the disappointment i had with the last installment of the farseer trilogy and after the gre
6936,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,the characterisation of fitschivalry through the series is brilliant the books are told from the first person entirely thus the reader witnesses the change in his thoughts as he grows into a man in this book he has developed a new persona tom badgerlock this is set fifteen years after the red ship wars and king verity’s reawakening of the dragons tom badgerlock is the person fitschivalry has evolved into the one he always wanted to be he is the man with a simple life a small farm a fe
6937,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,i went into this story with zero expectation my poor heart was still very tender after the beating it got in assassin’s quest but then i saw everyone reading one or the other fitz book and going ga ga over i kept thinking “did we read the same fitz stories ” to find the answer i thought why not give another chance to fitz perhaps he did better in this and oh boy this book simply blew me away all my complaints of fitz being whinny and doing nothing went out of the wind ms hobb what did
6938,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,again robin hobb demonstrates that you don’t need to write grimdark to generate realism high drama or sinister undertones now i love my grimdark as much as hannibal loves liver phphpht but hobb’s realism is expressed in believable characters complex relationships detailed worldbuilding wait wait wait a minute now what about blood and guts yes there will be blood too but the joojoo is not in the gore the joojoo is in the sustained threat of violence the joojoo is in the way th
6939,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,do not you sense it a crossroads a vertex a vortex all paths change from here this book made my cry multiple times i don t often cry while reading books i takes a lot and i might blame it on pregnancy hormones except hobb made me cry in her last two series liveship traders and farseer trilogy and when i read those i wasn t pregnant but this book again has ruined me in a good way robin hobb is the type of author that slowly builds her story she introduces her character and you live their
6940,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,this is more or less what i look like whenever fitzchivalry farseer is involved so many books later and i’m still feeling überprotective of fitz i got furious with his neighbour when he attacked fitz in the market place i wanted to kick starling out of the door and none too gently and i was even too angry to cry when the inevitable happened view spoiler [and nighteyes dies it was num pages in the making and still i was shocked hide spoiler ] what robin hobb manages to do is quite amazin

6943,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,num num gaah these books frustrate the hell out of me absolutely and wholly but i love them the plot the characters i think i hate them like i do because they are so damn realistic never the happy ending to anything only the harsh and brutal reality the main character is brave and good lovable he is also a fool a wimp that makes mistakes that you yell what the hell are you doing at same for other characters one moment you scream your head of at them the next you sit there grinn
6944,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,this is book num in the tawny man series which follows on from the events of the farseer books and the liveship books this series relates a lot more to the characters from the initial farseer books such as fitz the fool and various other characters both old and new who are local to bukkeep we are told that the main character first person again of fitz is now num so it s about num years after the farsser series as we follow fitz we don t actually know an awful lot about the life he s been l
6945,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,i am broken my love for fitz and the fool is strong as ever but my heart is broken from the events of this book i didn t cry but i screamed also fitz and the fool i ship it so damn hard 
6946,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,when i say i couldn t put it down i mean i couldn t put it down this num page book took me about num hours to finish i listened to it on audio and i couldn t disconnect myself i listened during my commute during work during cooking during putting my kids to bed it was so great to reconnect with old characters and watch how they have matured this book is set almost num years after assassin s quest fitz is no longer whiny and misguided the fool is no longer mean spirited additionally i
6947,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,this is my third time of reading this series and it still remains my absolute favourite fitz fool and of course nighteyes are absolute heroes and can do no wrong in my eyes wishful thinking below but who cares and i may get my wish come true in the new series you never know 
6948,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,it was a strange transition from the pace of the liveship traders to the pace of this trilogy told like the farseer trilogy entirely in first person from fitz’s perspective fitz is a thorough scribe to say the least and this is definitely a set up book the main plot doesn’t begin until num pages in but i appreciated this for its quiet steadiness and found myself getting surprisingly emotional over passing moments of dialogue and introspection i absolutely can’t wait to read the next t
6949,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,another great book about our hero fitz i especially love reading about him for some reason and this book was no exception i can t go too much into the story since it s a continuation of the long series robin hobb has created but i can say that i liked how we get to follow fitz at an older age and i loved that this novel contains cats d i m definitely going to continue on with this series once autumn really sets in 
6950,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,fool s errand picks up num years after the events of assassin s quest fitz is living a quite life in a cottage with a boy he adopted and his loyal wolf nighteyes naturally things can t stay quiet for poor fitzy fitz adventure comes to his door in the shape of chade followed by the fool the first num chapters or so deal primarily with catching up with fitz and finding out what s been going on in his life in any other writer s hands this would be tedious but hobb slowly reveals his past in a ta
6951,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,so good to be back in the world of the six duchies fitz is a grown man now and was living a rather relaxed life for a change that couldn t last forever robin hobb sucks me right in and makes me feel one with fitz i love his character what a softy sometimes haha rather sad twist at the end but she was building towards it meh 
6953,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,i often have problems with sequels but not this one robin hobb delivers with amazing character development great plot twists and brings in great new characters in the first book of the tawny man trilogy the farseer trilogy assassin s apprentice royal assassin assassin s quest liveship traders trilogy ship of magic the mad ship ship of destiny the tawny man trilogy fool s errand the golden fool fool s fate the rain wild chronicles dragon keeper dragon haven city of dragons bl

6956,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,3,this is my third robin hobb book the previously read ones were num and num stars this particular book is only three stars for just two reasons her other books moved at a much faster pace than this one i still enjoyed the writing but it definitely felt slow going it also seemed very singular in plot focus but with that being said those are my only two complaints i love her writing it is vibrant and clear she does world building well she gives the reader wonderful characters you can root fo
6957,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,i woke up this morning and thought to myself hey i really feel like having my heart ripped out and dashed upon the stones yes it is definitely time to reconnect with fitz 
6960,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,i really enjoyed getting back into the bastard s world although honestly most of the novel was pastoral and catching up with the main character after almost two decades of living without adventure when the story picked up the intrigue was decent and the developments hinted at greater things for the future it was almost like enjoying his comfortable life was a well earned and just reward for what happened to him as a child being drawn back into the world of royalty seemed inevitable because
6961,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,i see that i still haven t reviewed this and i m already num into the second one well there isn t a lot to say really if you like hobb and her previous two trilogies about the elderlings realm you ll want to continue here we re back to the first person narrative of fitz himself and it s great to catch up with old friends the story itself is decent enough but what struck me about this particular book was the slow build true this is a staple of long hobb books but here is where it real
6962,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,3,the first half is meh second half better meh while i did end up enjoying it it was just so slow and boring yet it still manages to bring a major case of the feels still reeling over that one the characters are like always excellent but they re different and while it s more realistic i still wanted more of younger fitz hopefully the next book is much better but after num book i fully trust robin hobb and am extremely excited the next two books in the trilogy
6963,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,simply put this is a love letter to farseer fans 
6964,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,fool’s errand is the first book in robin hobb’s tawny man trilogy which is the third subseries in her larger realms of the elderlings series this is the last subseries that i had already read in the past i enjoyed this just as much as i had remembered it starts to tie together things from both of the previous subseries and it was fun to reread it and see those connections so clearly i really don’t remember if i caught all the connections the first time i read it or not my memory of it was
6965,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,looooooove these books i have been trying to parcel these out to myself first because they are just so wonderful i want to enjoy them for a while but second because they re a serious time investment and i have a constant stream of books coming into and out of my life needing to be read but it was convention time and ms hobb was the guest of honor so what better experience than to be reading one of her books while hanging out in the same hotel i figured i d get the story of the fool 
6966,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,the first time i read fool s errand i would not have given it num stars i read it when it came out actually before since i had the advance i wanted to know what happened to fitz and his friends so desperately and the story doesn t go anywhere fast i finished it disappointed and dissatisfied and robin hobb tends to backload her books i noticed starting with this one but ship of magic suffers from it too it seems as though it is hard for her to get started and there is time more or less s
6967,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,this was one of the sadder books in the series but i have to admit i could not put it down there s nothing quite like reading a book that really grabs you i really enjoyed re reading the first trilogy seeing fitz and his friends so young but i particularly enjoy older fitz lots of great new characters grand adventure loss love and all things that make a great book another beautiful book in a long series of beautiful books on to the next one 
6968,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,i’m just so happy to be back with fitz and the fool i found the first half of the book to be a little slow going but not boring but when the story picked up i couldn’t put it down 
6970,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,astounding more please view spoiler [ robin hobb is one of my great literary loves and this book reminded me precisely why that is i must be honest when i started this book i expected to like it but that i would have some reservations because the six duchies books aren t my favourites the liveship traders is my favourite trilogy so far as assassins unfortunately failed to capture me in quite the same way this was mainly due to the fact that fitz the protagonist annoyed me somewhat 
6971,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,possibly the most absorbing in the series yet this is definitely a miss your subway stop sneak it at your desk at work stay up way too late kinda book it s been num years fitzchivalry has taken on the identity of tom badgerlock and has been finally living the simple life he always wanted a near hermit in a rural cottage alone except for his adopted son hap and occasional visits from the minstrel starling but events seem to conspire to end this quiet time fitz says no to chade s re
6972,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,i had lost my taste for swords n horses fantasy until a few years ago when i was persuaded by many enthusiastic recommendations to read george r r martin s epic fantasy series i enjoyed it so much that i began to sample this genre again and robin hobb is one of my favorite discoveries of this year i can see where not everyone would enjoy these books they re long and slowly plotted with more character development than action the medieval setting is pretty standard and there s nothing part
6976,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,infinite number of bright shining stars robin hobb s words and descriptions consume the insides of my skin infusing itself with the blood flowing within me that carries each emotion to all the parts of my body it s as if she skills to her readers the writing in here is as always full of wisdom i have taken a lot of advice from these books that i ve applied in my own journey to finding peace albeit mine wasn t as adventurous as fool and fitz s i don t know of any other author in fantasy that
6978,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,fifteen years after the last trilogy an older fitz is living in a small home with his son and his wolf nighteyes he lives a quiet life tending to his home and garden while raising his boy of course things never stay too quiet for fitz chade and the fool come knocking on his door prince dutiful is missing and it s up to fitz to save him the book starts off catching up with fitz for the first couple hundred pages it s all about fitz and his past and what he s been up to in the last fifte
6979,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,hang in there for the slow start it really build up the characters of the protagonists for the readers to relate and to enjoy the rest of the story when the book ends i actually long to read the next book in the series great writing awesome plot development and beautiful prose narration by james langton was skillfully done highly recommended i would love to see jake gyllenhaal play fitzchivalry farseer in film don t you agree

6982,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,my love for fitz the fool and nighteyes knows no bounds fanart for the feels by sophiealteaki maybe the liveship traders is the most popular hobb series because it adheres to fantasy rules the most out of hobb s other trilogies multiple povs epic battle scenes ship wars dragons unique world and lore and heart stopping action and then you have fitzchivalry farseer s adventures slower paced more in line with the traditional fantasy worlds not that much action narrated only from fitz s poi
6983,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,num num stars i so thoroughly enjoyed being back with these characters i took my time reading this because i didn t want it to end there was a point in this book where i cried and another time where i sat there numbly for a minute and couldn t go on reading for a few hours at this point it s rare for me to become as emotionally invested in a book as i was in this 
6984,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,brilliant just brilliant 
6985,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,find this and many other reviews over at geekritique robin hobb has written many books in her far reaching realm of the elderlings series her most notable perhaps would be the novels chronicling the life of fitzchivalry farseer the bastard son of prince chivalry and all the trials and struggles beset him fitz is one of the most tormented souls in all of fantasy giving even the starks a run for their money introduced first in the farseer trilogy fitz story continues in the tawny man tril
6986,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,3,fool’s errand by robin hobb is the start of the tawny man trilogy a series that i have been wanting to read for years i waited until a great time and this year after reading the liveship trader trilogy it seemed like the right time fool’s errand is the first book in robin hobb’s third trilogy in her elderling series and is an epic fantasy in first person the first trilogy farseer trilogy is one of my favorite trilogies of all time and fitz the fool and nighteyes are some of my favorite
6987,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,another buddy read with the fantabulous and marvelous david green “the truth i discovered is a tree that grows as a man gains access to experience a child sees the acorn of his daily life but a man looks back on the oak ” “death is always less painful and easier than life you speak true and yet we do not day to day choose death because ultimately death is not the opposite of life but the opposite of choice death is what you get when there are no choices left to make ” somehow i have
6988,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,robin hobb s writing is brilliant she goes into so much depth and detail with the characters and their interactions that even though this is a fantasy universe the characters seem so real the conversations are some of the most realistic i ve read and the dialogue is incredibly well done for roughly the first num pages we are catching up with fitz and not a whole lot really happens i don t think any other author could do this and make it as interesting as hobb does she manages to be captiva
6989,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,after num hours of near non stop reading i have finished reading this extraordinary book after beginning with the farseer triology and progressing to the liveship triology i picked up the tawny man triology with a near maniacal need for more robin hobb has created a fantasy universe the likes of which modern fantasy has never seen the fool s errand is one of the most emotionally draining books i have ever read not even martin in his soiaf series has affected me so deeply similar to the far
6990,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,why do i still keep on reading fitz’ tale when it leaves me drained why because i can’t help myself hoping that something great awaits him which will worth all the misery and pain endured by now view spoiler [vain hopes so far… hide spoiler ] and because this series stands between liveships traders and rain wild chronicles and i don’t want to miss anything taking into consideration that they are related in some aspects and of course because robin hobb is such a great storyteller she crea
6991,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,much preferred to the first fitz trilogy but maybe because the fitz books are so well integrated into this it also worked really well for me because i read the first trilogy nearly num years ago and so i have been away from the world of buck keep as long as fitz himself had my only minor niggle is that the first third of the book was very slow and by the end of that section i was on the verge of getting restless for some action loved this book 
6993,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,my favorite robin hobb book yet i really related to the older fitzchivalry more and also like the story line i was glad he wasn t going to spend the entire rest of his life in hiding 
6996,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,executive summary this is another great entry in the realm of the ederlings it picks up not long after the liveship traders and num years after the farseer trilogy if you enjoyed those previous books i imagine you will enjoy this one as well if you haven t read those books i highly recommend you do before starting this one full review like all the previous books in the realm of the ederlings books this starts off slow without much indication as to what the main plot will be in a lot of boo
6997,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,this is probably closer to a num num star i picked this up without reading any of the farseer books or the liveship books or indeed any of robin hobbs other books i regret this majorly and if you are reading this review and are in the same situation go back read the other books first saying that did enjoy this book a lot –nighteyes reminded me so much of my dog scamp who sadly passed away last year it was bitter sweet to be reminiscing of her whilst reading i really loved his humour and thought
6998,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,3,it’s a difficult trick – finishing one trilogy and then starting another with the same set of characters there’s so much to catch on so much to get up to speed with so much to refresh the readers’ memories of it’s unsurprising then that the first half of ‘fool’s errand’ doesn’t burst out of the traps instead there’s a hell of a lot of sitting around a remote cottage reminiscing frankly it’s a good thing nearly everyone reading this is at least three books invested as it wouldn’t be the
6999,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,spoilers what a pleasure to come across fitz and the fool again num years have passed since the end of royal assassin and fitz is no longer fitzchivalry fraseer the witted bastard everyone believes is long dead he is now known as tom badgerlock a farmer i loved getting a full account of what happened to him since we ve last seen him dreaming about carving his own dragon with nighteyes his meeting with chade was heart worming and dream shattering at the same time but ever since the fool 
7000,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,i really enjoyed this story i have wanted to read a book by this author for years and finally got around to it i did a buddy read of this and don t remember exactly why we started here this story takes place num years after another trilogy that starts with assassin s apprentice i m actually glad we started here while there were a lot of references to the past i really enjoyed getting to know the characters at these ages now before we go on we will go back and read the first one i m e
7001,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,i thoroughly enjoyed this series the political maneuvering the complex plotlines the multi dimensional characters in a way this was a protracted happy ending for the first trilogy it is difficult to express what i love about this series without giving the plot away suffice to say i found the fool s gift to fitz from the girl on the dragon a philosophical and profound answer to some of the unanswered questions in the first i am not too certain who did the growing up i the reader or fi
7003,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,loved it i m four books into this series now and i love fitz and i love the fool and i thought this book was excellent if i had a complaint is that the plot took a bit too long to develop i thought the story lingered a bit too long with fitz at his little cottage once fitz left things got moving and i couldn t stop turning pages there s a part at the end of the book that had me in tears it wasn t a surprise but it broke my heart side note i skipped the liveship series and went strai
7004,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,3,this series returns to the world of fitzchivalry farseer only now he has renamed himself tom badgerlock ten years have passed since he retired from court intrigue and politics but of course there is need for him again and he is drawn back he is required to go and save his son of his body only the agent of this change is the fool also known as the white prophet who also has a new name lord golden while the story felt a bit pedestrian the familiar characters drew me along and made me
7005,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,fantasy this spin off series follows after assassin s quest and is set about num years later as with the prior series it is told in first person from the viewpoint of fitzchivalry farseer aka tom badgerlock the tawny man the fool lord golden also plays a key role as does nighteyes the wolf as well as spymaster councellor chade and queen ketricken we also meet some new characters most notably thick the musical skiller and prince dutiful good story if longer than i like and the pace
7006,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,3,nothing much happened in this book first half is basically about fitz receiving guests and overthinking everything second half was much better fitz and fool reunion was nice i enjoyed the fool s new scandalous persona lord golden great to meet nighteyes again i always love reading about wit bond and the wolf was as feisty as i remembered but no thanks hobb for breaking my heart yet again she broke my heart so many times now and those damned cats cats are evil most of them if i had
7009,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,this first book in the tawny man series is yet another exceptionally well written and masterfully crafted tale centered around hobb s beloved characters fitz and the fool looking forward to continuing on with the next in the series 
7011,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,all of the feels all of them this is shaping up to be a good trilogy already 
7012,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,the interaction with and wisdom of the wolf nighteyes makes this a num star read 
7013,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,between farseer trilogy and tawny man trilogy there was a different trilogy called the liveship traders here some of the elderling secrets were revealed but there is not a strong connection between fitz s world at least not yet therefore fool s errand starts with reminders about the previous adventures of fitz num years passed since the red ship wars from the farseer trilogy fitz and nighteyes are left alone in an isolated area living their lives in peace hab is a teenager now ready to ta
7015,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,no spoilers here first in a new series that gives us fitz and the fool from hobb s assassin trilogy along with the expanded world view from the liveship traders trilogy fifteen years has passed and we find fitz living in self imposed exile most thinking he is long dead but his peace is to end as he is sought out by people from his past one being his mentor the fool what has happened prince dutiful heir to the throne has disappeared and he must be found once again great characters a
7016,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,now that i read book num of the tawny man series all the emotions and thoughts i had while reading the fool s errand emerge again and i want to write my review for it now finally robin hobbs books are always very hard for me to review since i love them so much and i don t think that i can write the review that this book deserves but i ll try i m sure that most people know what this book is about so far so i only write some of my thoughts down here i had some problems to get into the book thi
7017,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,there s no reason for me not to give this five stars which means that five it is i ll wait until i finish the series to give a full review but for now just a few points i have never read a song of ice and fire but i ve watched game of thrones through the first four seasons and i still don t forgive george r r martin for ned stark s death i felt the same way about hobb for embedding verity in his stone dragon when fitz talks about visiting verity as dragon after the red ship wars sea
7018,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,few writers can spend the first num pages of a novel on the day to day life of a man living in self imposed exile feeding his chickens and chatting with his cantankerous wolf and have me absolutely riveted robin hobb is one of those writers it s been years since i read the farseer trilogy but it wasn t long before i was once again well acquainted with fitz and nighteyes and the fool i hadn t even realised how much i missed them but even more than the beloved characters or the immersive worl
7019,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,usually i am not sure about visiting old characters particularly after awesome and arduous adventures however the sort of slow beginning to this book adjusts you to this idea and builds up to where fitz can go on another adventure it is certainly a different sort of fitz to what we have known in the farseer trilogy and he is older wiser and still suffering from the past i liked those elements as people do change from their experiences and with age and his relationships with old friends are a
7020,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,i ve read robin hobb chronologicly first the farseer which i truly enjoyed then the liveships which i enjoyed but found a bit too tedious and now i have read fool s errand and i must say this book is one of the books i have enjoyed most during my entire life no kidding this book it s like it s written just for me thank s robin h like the author followed just my receipt for the perfect book and the main reason for my enormous love is the characters we follow i am utterly in lov
7022,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,fitz returns in an even more character driven intimate and introspective story that takes a record time to get going but still manages to throw in some excitement along the way not to mention some very emotional moments probably requires reading at least the farseer trilogy first and reading the liveship traders while not essential probably helps though i didn t the first time not for people who don t like slow rumination for lovers of fitz however this isn t just back to the qual
7023,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,my reviews usually contain my reactions/feelings after finishing the book and my opinion on the writing i don t go into summarizing the story at all so this far into the realm of elderlings universe there s no point in me writing a review for the rest of the books in this saga because the world building the character arcs and the writing have been awesome since the first book and i m more than positive that it is so for the rest of the series fitzchivalry s character development is as gut
7024,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,great quote on page num nighteyes a wolf when i wallow in something dead to reawaken the savor of it you rebuke me fitzchivalry meaning nighteyes you should leave off sniffing the carcass of your old life my brother you may enjoy unending pain i do not there is no shame in walking away from bones changer nor is there any special wisdom in injuring oneself over and over what is your loyalty to that pain to abandon it will not lesson you 
7025,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,crying my dumb face off at the end of this book this book is a much better than the last farseer book because there has been practically no whining from fitz about moooollllyyyyyy because he s an adult now it s nice but this book is sad as fuck especially after just finishing the farseer trilogy num night eyes
7026,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,how i ve missed my precious fitz and this world robin hobb writes clever fantasy with rich writting strong characters and adventurous plot cannot wait to jump into the next book 
7027,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,this was an easy three or four star until that last page damn that hit me hard also i was on a plane and had stayed up all night and was very emotional but it was still a very good last page

7035,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,2,this going to be really hard for me but i am going to try to review this book after reading it s num chapters and then finally deciding to quit it after that i was really looking forward to read this book after a fantastic live ship traders trilogy but after a good start to this book things started to go down gradually and i just could not take it much longer this book suffers from all the same ailments by which the last book in farseer s trilogy suffered from num the story is quite simple for a
7037,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,i loved this book so much it honestly just made my heart so happy to be back with these characters that i love so much i knew i had missed them but i didn t realize just how much i am anxious to pick up the next book that s for sure ♥
7038,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,it is written by robin hobb do i need to say more 
7039,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,my eyes are all cried out and my heart is so full this instalment was probably my favourite so far of the farseer story i loved it because it was so well paced i never was bored during the num pages and it was a formula that i loved it reminded me of fitz’s mission in jjaampe i loved that we met my favourite characters again except it was rude not to include patience and barely any burrich or kenddriken it made up for it however by featuring the fool for at least half of the book and

7041,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,so many gosh darn feels 😢 num num/num warning spoilers for the farseer trilogy i have missed fitz i loved hobb s liveship traders trilogy but fitz and the fool hold a special place in my heart and i m glad to be spending time with them again as always hobb does a remarkable job of crafting believable characters vivid settings and intricate plots full of intrigue and emotion set some fifteen years after the ending of assassin s quest the story begins with fitz living in hiding isolated from bu
7042,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,this is the seventh robin hobb book i ve read this year and by far the best one in the realm of the elderlings series solidifying her as one of my favorite writers ever the first three books the farseer trilogy establish the world magical systems main characters and big plot developments and conflicts of this series they were wonderful in character development writing style and overall originality but not without their problems mainly i felt hobb tried to do too much and there were too
7043,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,after taking a break from reading the first six of robin hobb’s realm of the elderlings series i decided i was hungry for more hobb is one of my favourite female fantasy authors and the seventh instalment of this series was every bit as good as the first six after the events of the liveship trader trilogy we travel back to the six duchies some fifteen years after the end of assassin’s quest fitzchivalry farseer lives a quiet life away from the politics of the kingdom with his wolf nighteyes
7044,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,audiobook narrated by james langton fool s errand takes place years after the events of robin hobb s farseer trilogy and does not disappoint the story is as well written as hobb s previous works and is great from beginning to end the story kind of fills the gap between the trilogies and explains in greater detail the events concluding the farseer trilogy while also building into this new adventure the story is kind of broken into a summation of past events and then embarking on something new t
7045,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,it was amazing it s one of those books that i will definitely always remember and i know i will read it again it s way better than any of the books of farseer trilogy which i really liked but it took me some time to get into it and i gave farseer trilogy num stars now i wish i could give fool s errand at least num stars it had me hooked from the very beginning one of the reasons is that fitz is a grown man now i liked him as a child or very young man but sometimes i wanted him to finally grow
7046,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,3,after completing the fool s errand i realise i both love and hate the book which is not altogether an unfamiliar feeling when i read hobb i will not delve deep into describing the book in detail for those who read this book already know who fitz is and how his world is build there are many things in this book which i loved and many which put me off it to me was like a song parts of which elate your heart and parts which you know are out of place the book opens with fitz and nighteyes givi
7047,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,ah fitz fitz fitz you are still my hero but there were times i didn t like you very much in this book but that s the beauty of robin hobb s writing her characterization is brilliant and amazing creating complex believable and realistic individuals who possess as many flaws and foibles as they do strengths and good qualities the reader can feel invested in them and can share their every doubt conflict and emotion and this applies not only to the human characters but the animal ones
7048,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,i m finally back in the world of hobb this is the third trilogy in her vast realm of the elderlings books the first farseer trilogy is best series i ve ever read so i m thrilled to be back with some of my favorite characters this installment follows up with beloved and not so beloved characters fifteen years after the conclusion of the red ship wars peace has finally been attained but is unsurprisingly tenuous i do not recommend reading the descriptions on the back of these books go to
7050,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,“he came one late wet spring and brought the wide world back to my doorstep ” this was the first line and once i read it i have to admit i squealed i cannot begin to express how much i love robin hobb s characters and fitz more than anyone else this is written in first person so we get the entire story from fitz s pov and it s a pov that s flawed but feels justified when you read things from his perspective the way hobb writes the subtle changes in his thoughts and perspective is master
7051,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,i tried to read this book about a month ago but quickly realized i was missing something i looked it up and found out that this is the numst book in the numrd trilogy set in this world so i put it down and pick up the real first book assassin s apprentice robin hobb s stories are very character oriented and she does well investing just enough effort into her characters to hook the reader right away i have noticed that some authors need a significant number of pages to develop plot lines that in
7052,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,here is the start of the second and so far last trilogy written by hobb starring fitz and fool fitz has been living with his adoptive son hap and his wolf nighteyes in seclusion away from the farseer trappings but he is drawn back in after the disappearance of prince dutiful alright if you didn t fall in love with these characters by assassin s quest there s not much here to change your mind not much actually happens and it is different from any other hobb book as it can be described as a
7053,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,num num out of num stars see this review and others at the speculative shelf it is so good to see these characters again after three books away when we last left fitzchivalry farseer his story had ended in a place that i was comfortable with and he seemed to be at peace i was initially apprehensive about his return to action but author robin hobb eventually coaxed me back just as chade and the fool do for fitz as such our now unretired protagonist must use his magical wit and skill to tra
7054,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,num/num/num num/num book num just as good as farseer if not better the relationships are more detailed fitz fool nighteyes dutiful another big page turner fitz is such a terrific charcter series num/num the tawny man blends some characters and situations from hobb s first two series this series again focuses on fitz the main character from the farseer series i think the more narrow focus really helps relationships are more detailed and fitz is an incredible character not a ton of things happ
7055,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,num/num i love crying myself to sleep because of robin hobb 
7057,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,i m really glad i read the magic ships trilogy now they bring so much depth to the character of the fool i was a little lost at first as my reading of farseer was a couple of years ago but i got caught up in the story again quite soon and enjoyed every minute of it i can t remember the last time a book made me break out in spontaneous sobs like this one well that s not quite true it happened last in warhost of vastmark about a year and a half ago so on to golden fool fitz story is
7058,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,num num stars it was so good to get back to fitz to read robin hobb is to be lost in another world and be taken on a rollercoaster journey my emotions reading this varied wildly from comforted happy sad impatient and furious as usual with books i love i can barely find any words to describe it reading robin hobb is to know that you won t be disappointed except when you try to find other books that can match that standard the story could have been taken in a variety of directions with this boo
7059,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,one of the most memorable books this summer let me have and probably my favourite fitz book of all num i ve now read it was engrossing and it felt very easy to get lost in it in a good way the ending after the climax literary terms in english i am so not your person felt a little dragged out but i appreciated the calm and i enjoyed fitz and the prince s conversation i ve read a book or two from this series in english but most were in bulgarian hence with most of the names translate
7060,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,i had forgotten how amazing this book really is i was only about num when i read it for the first time and many things in it were too complex for me to appreciate at the time this time reading it almost ten years later i could not put it down and i loved every second of it though i am a bit of an emotional wreck right now my heart aches for fitz and the fool and nighteyes and dutiful what i really love about reading these books is that fitz character feels so alive re reading thes
7062,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,read as part of the r/fantasy book bingo challenge num for the novel written under a pseudonym category hard mode for this square required a book whose author has written under more than one pseudonym to read a robin hobb book usually feels like cheating especially as the point of bingo is to make you read well outside your comfort zone but as i ve been making my way through the realm of the elderlings books i realised i could take this opportunity to include her work on my bingo card 
7063,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,without any kind of surprise it just gets better every time i read it some people say to new readers that they wish they also just discovered the books too to have that feeling again i do not agree with hobb s books i feel like on every re read it gets better you see and understand many more things that had eluded you the first time you are engrossed in the story but can still enjoy the writing style more fitz melancholy touched me even more this time num out of num stars would recommand 
7064,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,regarding the entire tawny man trilogy i found this second trilogy to be even better than the farseer trilogy this series is very character driven with hobb digging deep into the characters and exploring betrayal friendship hate love sorrow trust and forgiveness while the characters are older they are not necessarily wiser and are still beautifully flawed the relationship between fitz and the fool is explored in a way that is at turns satisfying and heart breaking there aren t many
7065,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,i couldn t put it down this is the fifth hobb novel i ve read and the first one i almost unreservedly loved i still have some issues with some of her characterizations and boy does she take forever to get to actual inciting events but i m ok with that as long as the payoff is solid the end of this one is very very good i ll still thinking about it and i think a longer review might become a blog post soon we ll see 
7066,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,hobb you wonderfully amazing and cruel author you have once again broken my heart and made me enjoy the process a really lovely introduction back to the world of fitz with a gentle way of reintroducing the character and making me remember everything i loved about the first trilogy quite a harrowing first book with a lot of heartache and cruel scenes however this has spurred me into wondering why i leave it so long in between her books can t wait for the second 
7067,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,these characters friendships enemies fights and more have me enthralled this picks up num yrs later with our tortured beloved fitzchilvary and his wolf but no worries he s gonna tell you or rather an old friend exactly what he s been doing and once again duty calls the skills call his queen calls absolutely gut wrenching and captivating tears and laughter joy and defeat life and death 
7068,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,fitz is back and more morose than ever now a hermit fitz is called on once again to secretly save the six dutchies i loved this book it was better than the last elderlings book though fitz is a little less likable i m excited to see where the tawny man sends fitz next p s ms hobb loves the word tawny 
7069,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,this was just the right length for the story and moved quicker than the last two books of the fareer trilogy i hope the next two are like this since the fool is my favorite i loved seeing a lot more of him and found dutiful s progression interesting no one frustrated me in this though as a cat lover i have to say the cats in this are creepy even fennel especially fennel 
7071,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,when you are a fan of series such as this one is hard to give a completely objective review this book was a slow start and no doubt it needed to be that way num years had been since our fitz saw any action and a lot had to be said this book is just an introduction of what is to come it felt that way to me that s why the num stars but i m sure the next one will be better 
7073,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,3,this book was a bit slow but normally the first book in her trilogies start fairly slow i do like that each character really has his or her own personality and they don t deviate from it even when it would benefit the character and speed up the story to do so 
7074,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,this book started off slow i was a bit miffed that it wasn t delving right into the action then the second half of the book came and i couldn t put it down by the end i was a sobbing blubbering mess i don t know if i have ever cried so much while reading a book 
7076,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,this is my favourite of the fitzchivalry series so far i cried multiple times robin hobb has created a rich beautiful detailed world that has pulled me in and made me care deeply about this characters that to my mind is a huge feat 
7077,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,absolutely outstanding view spoiler [absolutely heart wrenching never loved a character the way i loved nighteyes felt like an absolute sucker punch too rip big brother hide spoiler ]
7079,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,3,this book was a great introduction back to the world of the six duchies and some of the characters from the farseer trilogy but i predicted the whole book from the summary 
7080,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,quite good i think i lost a bit by not having read the previous books but things were explained enough that i had no trouble following the story and filling in the background 
7081,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,it is slow at start and it really takes a while before the story really is on its way but once a the end it was worth all the waiting 
7083,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,was a bit slow in the middle but great ending 
7084,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,numth book read in num number num out of num on my all time book list review pending 
7085,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,fifteen years have passed since the end of the red ship war fitzchivalry farseer is believed dead with only a few knowing the truth that he survived and helped end the war and the threat of the cruel king regal living a comfortable life as a smallholder with his wolf nighteyes and an adopted son hap fitz occasionally has strange dreams he dismisses these until his old friend the fool visits with news prince dutiful the son of queen kettricken and the late king verity has vanished in a
7086,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,i love robin hobb s writing i put this book off for awhile because i was in such a book hangover after reading liveship traders it s arguably my favorite fantasy book after hp and i had a difficult time moving on to her other books because i knew nothing would live up to that series but while i didn t end up loving this as much as liveship i m extremely glad i finally picked it up because it still managed to be great the novel started out fairly slow taking its time to reintroduce fitz an
7088,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,3,i approached this with trepidation as i didn t enjoy fitz at all as a character in his first series but middle aged fitz is easier to get along with softened a little around the edges and his dilemmas about protecting home and family are ones i can relate to as often with robin hobb s books i felt this story had no need to be so long but i was able to relax into the narrative and enjoy the details of the world of the six duchies and fitz s physical and emotional journey 
7089,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,another gem from hobb i love the web that she weaves through all her trilogies masterful and addictive 
7090,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,ah fitz my friend it was good to meet up with you again but i m going to part ways with you just for a little while because your misfortune is sometimes too much to bear 
7091,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,[gathering all the shredded little pieces of my heart and gluing them together readying them to go through the shredder again]
7094,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,it was like visiting an old friend one i hadn’t seen in a long time i didn’t realize how much i missed fitz’s narration until i started fool’s errand i was immediately hooked and so happy to have returned to fitz and his companion nighteyes fool’s errand picks up some years after the events in the farseer trilogy and the liveship traders trilogy fitz is now num years old goes by the name tom badgerlock and has become a recluse with an aging nighteyes at his side who’s not as nimble as h
7095,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,i wonder how many times hobb is planning to stab me in the fucking heart for the rest of the series worth it though 
7098,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,fool s errand is the first book in the tawny man series or number seven in the farseer series however you want to look at it i would not recommend one start at this book because the character backgrounds are important to understanding the decisions they make fitz narrates this book and the story begins num years after the farseer trilogy ends he has lived a simple secluded life with nighteyes and a boy he raised named hap we don t know much about hap other than starling brings him to fitz to
7099,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,num/num returning once again to the adventures of fitz robin hobb still manages to make an exciting start in this trilogy as her writing continues to be very good but at the same time also being beautifully captivating fifteen years has passed since the end of the first trilogy and fitz has now grown up and lives alone far from anyone that really knows him as he tries in his personal exile to find his own life in the world after all that he had to sacrifice for the salvation of the six duchies 
7100,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,fool s errand really connected with me and i am really surprised how much i enjoyed it there is one scene that is really moving and i felt myself tearing up so i really can t rate a book less than num stars if that happens fitzchivalry has reinvented himself as tom badgerlock he lives in near isolation in the woods with his wolf nighteyes and a young orphan hap he has raised like a son the only contact he has from his past is the minstrel starling he occasionally skill dreams and sees h
7101,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,a num num in the long years since the events of the farseer trilogy fitz has been living a quiet life as tom badgerlock away from buckkeep and all he loves save for the now elderly nighteyes and hap a foundling he s taken in and with no visitors save for the occasional tryst with starling who s become even more of a selfish nasty bitch in the intervening years he s become an old man before his time a sort of peace has settled over the six duchies in the wake of the red ships war but the l
7102,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,before i get into this review i just want to point out that if you are reading this and are interested in reading robin hobb which you totally should be i highly encourage you to read hobb s previous trilogies farseer and liveship traders before diving into this one they are fantastic and you will lose out on a lot of the enjoyment to be had in tawny man if you skip them with that said this was by far my favorite hobb book yet i went through an emotional wringer while reading it and
7104,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,num num stars it s been a couple of years since i last read one of robin hobb s books and re immersing myself in fitz story has reminded me of just how much i love hobb s work first and foremost with hobb s books is the writing every sentence flows beautifully every word of dialogue feels real and every page drags me deeper and deeper into the world she has created second is the characters fool s errand sees the return of one of my favourite characters the fool this time wearing the guise o
7105,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,for those who have waded through fitzchivalry s previous trilogy adventure assassin s books this is a brilliant return to cherished characters and wonderful opening to new storylines for those who have never laid eye on the city of buck keep never fear you ll be pulled along for the ride summary no plot spoilers hidden away in a small cabin with adopted son hap fitz is shaken out of self imposed exile to serve his family the farseers with his aging wolf companion by his side and old
7106,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,you know you ve found a good series when you can slip back into the world after a few months and have scarcely forgotten a thing fool s errand a title so true and simultaneously puntastic that i love it all the more picks up many years after the end of assassin s quest but despite the great leap in the timeline everything i loved about the original series remains sterling writing excellent plots and the characters that were and are the highlight of hobb s world i was sad not to see as ma
7107,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,the story took its time to truly catch some wind under its wings not much happened for about the first num pages it was just fitz being restless and wondering if he should take the task that was given to him but after he made his decision the story began to move forward fast the text was enjoyable the storyline interesting and i wasn’t even annoyed by fitz anymore the fifteen years of exile had in my opinion done fitz much good he was no longer the miserable whiner i had grown to
7108,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,as per usual robyn hobb starts this series with a bang i love that still this deep into fitz s life we re still learning and understanding not only the skill but the wit as well her understanding and perception on animals is relatable and at times beautiful the humour in this this book is great all character humour is believable and the way she perceives cats especially jinna s cat fennel is hilarious jinna herself is an intriguing character i immediately warmed to her despite fitz s ini
7109,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,fitz s and the fool s adventures continue in fool s errand the first book of the tawny man trilogy the book is set fifteen years after assassin s quest fitz now donning the identity of tom badgerlock has become a recluse after adventuring with nighteyes for several years he has settled down in a remote region of buck adopted a foundling name hap and now spends his days tending to chickens and writing down the history of the six duchies his quiet life is interrupted by fool and the tendri
7110,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,robin hobb at her best i remember that when i first read it i thought this book started slow and took a relatively long time to get into but i didn t have that experience this time maybe because i just read the preceding two trilogies earlier this year entering the world of fitz felt like slipping into a comfortable robe or relaxing in a warm bath i felt at home and i could have read much more about his simple life at a small farm with a foster son to take care of and the visit of the
7112,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,spoilers for the farseer trilogy in this review if you haven t read that yet don t read this review robin hobb is probably the only author who manages to write a novel that can leave me thinking that was fantastic so well written but not very much seemed to happen that is the beauty of her books they are so driven by the characters stories and the writing that the plot can be as slow as it wants and the book will still be brilliant fool s errand again follows the perspective of fitzch
7113,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,my heart hurts after reading this book for fifteen years or for me two months i have been without fitz and his dear fool i wondered how different things would be would he be happy with his wolf nighteyes how did the appearance of a adoptive son be for him a change for the good fortunately all those questions were answered but unfortunately for fitz he had to return to the life he knew under a guise and watch it all fall apart at the seams i marathon ed this book in such a short am
7114,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,as always it was a pleasure to return to fitz s world this book takes place fifteen years after the end of the first trilogy and it somehow perfectly achieved both a feeling of continuity fitz s narrative still feels like fitz and important character growth resulting from the passage of time it was hard to put the book down and i stayed up late to finish it even though i had to work the next day this was an emotional book i both laughed and cried view spoiler [i definitely cried when n
7116,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,this is a multi series combined review and is copied/pasted across all of hobb s related series it does not refer only to this trilogy and includes liveship rain wilds farseer tawny man and dragon keeper series these are the most compelling most enjoyable best plotted most complicated epic fantasy books i ve read in ages i adored them there are num interwoven inter dependent series that the author clearly outlined before picking up her pen for the first time the characters are wo
7118,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,i read this book back when it first came out num years ago and remember not liking it all that much in fact i remembered nothing about the next two books so either i did not read them or i made myself forget this time i liked this first book much better but of course still not as much the scope of the story is much smaller and it takes a while to get going i don t blame anyone for that because there s num years between assassin s quest and the beginning of this book and because understa
7120,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,ugh i wasn t supposed to start the next but continuing with the same characters robin hobb series until a magical never gonna happen time in the near future when i have no books to read i just got num books from the library have to read num books for bookclub and there are other books chillin on the other side of my bed just waiting to have their time with me but no i have to go find an audiobook of an addictive fantasy series that doesn t really even add anything to my life except ridicul
7121,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,apparently this book follows the farseer trilogy so i lost a lot of background story from those previous books nonetheless it was easy to follow the plot considering this is the first book of a different trilogy this is the first time i’m introduced to a robin hobb book and her writing is really impressive not to mention her visual imagination it’s a very deep book no doubt about it and i’m not talking about its endless pages but the intense story the settings are so descriptive you fe
7122,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,3,wordy this book is wordy it needed an editor badly it could have been tightened up as there were things there that didn t need to be however in terms of brining the reader back to the world they missed after the farseer trilogy it was fantastic all the old gang is back together almost and once again they must save the world the plot was a little shaky and you could tell that it wasn t given the same attention as the overall plot of the series it was a subplot those were handled bet
7123,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,num stars but the first half really drags hobb does that to you her writing is so good she can keep you reading even though nothing is happening and cats hate cats always did always will especially now the fool is a great character amid many interesting ones however i am getting tired of the silly names for farseer royalty like prince dutiful the kid is a major pain almost to the end fitzchivalry is now tom badgerlock and does not come across as a warrior and assassin in retirement 
7124,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,this trilogy returns to the people populating hobb s first farseer trilogy num years later and guess what i still care about them a lot and can t wait to see how everyone s doing book number num in this world and i continue to be riveted hobb s storytelling really really works for me it wasn t until the end of the liveships trilogy that i realized there is a character common to all the books and that character the fool in the first trilogy amber in the second and the fool/lord golden in
7125,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,im crying how could you do this to me this novel for me was excellent it kept me interested on every page whereas the original trilogy suffered from long monologues of exposition the characters were extremely well crafted and the main mystery was very well done i also really liked the foreshadowing which was not so subtle but still really cool fitz has become more likable to me as a character as time has matured him and made him think about his actions [mostly] when in his youth he was b
7126,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,i read robin hobb a long time ago in college and then forgot all about it until my mother picked up the tawny man books and insisted i read them along with her i had a bit of a rough time getting into this book it may have had to do that it s the first book in a trilogy that acts as a sequel to the farseeer trilogy however it took a while to achieve any actual emotional resonance with the characters the dialog seemed stilted and the characters seemed a bit cliche and cardboard however 
7127,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,with the liveship trilogy much fresher in my mind than the farseer trilogy it took me a while to adjust to being back with fitz his narration is slower paced and his story continues to be full of pain so don t pick this up without some reserves of happiness to buoy yourself once i readjusted the action seemed to pick up and the mysteries became more intriguing the fool is incredibly entrancing and frustratingly mystifying as ever and i am left impatient for more for while my library bought t
7128,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,great adventure back with fitz really like the way robin h does a trilogy each book still feels like a standalone book with a concluding story yet fits into a larger overall arc book num in this world and nothing feels repeated all ideas are well thought out and many of the characters philosophical musings are well worth pondering and remembering back to this book i liked the timeline jump and the new roles of characters and the small interaction with liveship trilogy was tidy still lot
7129,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,3,i gave up reading hobb last july because i got quite depressed with the books that were a really long and b ended depressingly but they are good so i’ve picked back up again with this clearly it presumes you remember what the eff happened in the last book which i super don’t so it took me a while to get back into it who the hell is hob what was skilling about but then the book kind of takes a while to really get going as well there’s little in the way of plot for a hundred pages or so
7130,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,i love these books while i can also appreciate the complexity of the multi pov epics that seem to dominate these days occasionally i still just want to be told a story you know a one pov witness the narrative unfold through the eyes of the character it s happening to type of affair great characters fitz and the fool are two of my all time favorites and magic that s esoteric enough to not run the risk of drawing too much scrutiny to itself by the potential breaking of some sort of rul
7131,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,more great writing from hobb in the beginning book continuing from the farseer trilogy this first book of the tawny man trilogy picks up with fitz and the collected remains of his life num years after the ending of the last farseer book just as the first part of his life was filled with strife and the anguish i felt for him as a character this book continues his life with similar emotional themes of loss regret pain and reflection of the future and of self hobb s writing immerses you in hi
7132,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,i love fitz and the fool from the farseer trilogy and guess what this other trilogy is even more fitz and even more fool the book is great hobb is a master story teller and the first person point of view makes it feel extremely personal i have always felt that fitz is a troubled character and he seems to be always down on his luck and having bad times this book is no exception and its an emotional narrative at times i felt extremely sad and frustrated which i guess is a praise on hobb
7133,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,it feels strangely good to be emotionally traumatized again the first third was a bit slow but once it gets going it gets going i can only imagine the next two are going to be really great since they get to build off of this one as an aside if you re going through the realms of the elderlings series for the first time i highly recommend you read the liveship traders trilogy first before jumping into this one instead of going directly to this right after assassin s quest it gives tons of
7135,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,i don t reread many books but a knowing i loved these b loaning the first trilogy to friends c reading the beginning of the fitz and the fool trilogy and d finding my memory of the plot was fuzzy this seemed a good candidate i was pleasantly surprised to find i liked it as well as if not better than when i read it num years ago certain parts resonated with me a lot more than i think they can have the first time through and i will no longer suggest these to friends with the usual well 
7137,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,i liked this one alot i felt that since the end of the farseer trilogy fitz has grown and i really appreciated that he grew as a character throughout this book as well although typically hobb s books tend to drag in the beginning this one had the quickest pace of any so far i skipped the liveship and read the fitz books num num then this immediately following although many tragic things befall fitz pretty consistently throughout his life i d say this book was the first time i actually shed a
7138,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,fitzchivalry and the fool are two of my favorite characters in fantasy literature and hobb is one of the best in the genre her storytelling is masterful the depth of her characters second to none that i have read i cannot remember the last time a book brought me to tears but i wept at the end of this one this story arc spans twelve books all between num num num pages long and that prospect usually fills me with the dread of some chore with robin hobb it gives me comfort that i have such
7140,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,i just love this book i was a big fan of the farseer trilogy and was excited to start the next series about fitz and the fool book num of this series did not disappoint me it was a little slow to get started but the action picked right up and i could not put it down i love all the returning characters and even some of the new characters can t wait to read the other books i m sure this series will be just as great as the farseer trilogy 
7141,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,i d say this was my favourite fitz story so far lacking the at times tedious drag of the previous trilogy this story flowed a lot better and fitz as a character was more enjoyable to read about view spoiler [ nighteyes death certainly brought a tear to my eye that was beautifully handled hide spoiler ] overall a lovely book that references the liveship series and even answers a few questions from those books too unsure where the rest of this trilogy will go but looking forward to it 
7142,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,almost but not quite num stars view spoiler [nighteyes death hide spoiler ] broke my heart the book retains many of the original trilogy s flaws but also builds on its strengths maybe i am accustomed by now to hobb s writing maybe i am too invested in the characters that i cannot rate the book objectively regardless it took me less time to read this book than any in the first trilogy and now i can t stop 
7143,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,5,unique magics abound in this fully fleshed world imagined by robin hobb drawing the reader in and keeping him or her hooked i cannot recommend this book and series enough any fantasy reader who likes intricate world building that unfolds in glorious layers will dive in and happily enjoy hobb s creations the characterization is amazing there s never a moment where you doubt a character s actions even if you disagree with them every detail matters remember them you ll love it 
7144,Fool's Errand,Robin Hobb,4,just finished this i loved returning to this world and to fitz and the fool the the plot picks up at approximately num pages in before that it s really slow at just exploring what the characters have been doing though i must say that the climax was well done and not rushed as it always was in the farseer books i gave this book num num stars i like this book and plan on reading all num books from robin hobb i love love love her characters 
7145,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,i won t lie some small but undeniable part of me came to this book hoping to find fault it would take a better man than me to watch anthony ryan s barnstorming success without a twinge of envy sadly i have to report that this is a very good book and deserves the five stars i ve given it ryan writes well he brings his world and characters to life with good description it s as a story teller he shines though and a good story is always the keystone of a bestseller schools in fantasy books are

7148,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,a masterwork you don t want to miss it is with temerity that i declare blood song as one of the best debut novels i ve ever read why do i love this book the simple answer would be because this is a book that has everything i love in epic fantasy and that it hit all the right notes for me i could practically end my review with that answer but that wouldn t do justice to how great this book is now it s time for me to take on the role of the chronicler and inform you why it s essential for you
7149,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,1,commas matter they are important if someone say an author wishes to convey a particular meaning or concept or image through the words they use in the books they want to sell they are important for timing and sentence structure and plain ol literacy plus they make me feel good like i m reading something worth my time rather than some numth grade creative writing exercise there s a big difference between let s eat grandpa and let s eat grandpa also this his father didn t reply 
7150,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,if you like your fantasy rothfuss or sanderson style this is a great book for you it s a meaty epic fantasy with a really strong main character i was sucked in and definitely want to read the next one

7168,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,i had heard a lot of good things about this series but i felt that i went into it thinking it was going to be a three star at best i believe because it has been compared to name of the wind a book that i enjoyed that was subsequently ruined by its sequel the wise man s fear blood song is told in a similar manner the story is told from the perspective of the main character vaelin al sorna after the events have occurred he is telling his story to a scribe who has heard the stories of the hopeki

7216,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,okay wow this was such an amazing and fun and additive book everyone told me they loved it and i can definitely see why the story follows vaelin al sorna who at the age of ten is left at the gates of the sixth order by his father the sixth order are the elite soldiers of the faith and vaelin endures harsh training for years his story is amazing and i was hooked from the very beginning i went into this expecting it to be entertaining if a little generic so i was surprised by how enjoyable

7249,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,some of the best fantasy series start with the protagonist at a young age the advantage of this is you see the character develop mentally physically and you get the sense of growing with the character examples that immediately spring to mind are the prince of thorns a dance of cloaks the way of shadows the painted man and the left hand of god the blood song is a high calibre debut a self published novel that was available fairly cheaply on kindle and potentially a big future for the author

7277,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,ryan has fleshed out an excellent fantasy world the only drawback is a bit of sluggishness barring that a great read i will be continuing with this series 
7279,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,six that s the number of indie authors i ve come across in the past ten years to whom i am willing to return anthony ryan has joined that select company thanks to blood song the first novel in his raven s shadow series the fantasy world he s created is intricate and deep his characters come across as real people especially the secondary ones admittedly the mc is a bit too altruistic for my tastes most importantly however ryan s storytelling is excellent and the story itself is an excit
7280,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,some parts were quite slow but overall it was pretty entertaining i liked the characters more than the plot but the plot was still interesting plus the animals in this story were awesome 
7281,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,anthony ryan hit all the marks in this enjoyable first step into the raven shadow trilogy boy turned into a warrior plot with a twist if you liked joe abercrombie s first law series then this is a must read the audio book is narrated by steven brand who does a fabulous job 
7282,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,loved it although completely different then his draconis memoria books it still has a really cool vibe kinda nothing new that we havent seen alreadt but it ryan puts a a little twist of his own on this type of coming of age story not much magic but that didnt really bother me this time it is promising more on the magic stuff though i hope at least anyway num stars for this first book in the ravens shadow trilogy 
7283,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,3,this book had me thinking about ratings expectations and hype yes i expected a lot more the book was good but the problem was it stayed at that it was good it never crossed over to really good i do want to read book num one day to see if it gets to that awesome territory and to see what happens but no hurry this book has one hell of a rating and often when that s the case i think ok not for me but yes i can see why others really enjoyed it now i did enjoy the book but i sure could
7284,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,this was a big fantasy book for me to undertake i was a little uhh before i started it but if worse came to worse i could just delete it from my kindle and go well it wasn t for me i was pleasantly surprised at how much i actually enjoyed it well at least the first half of the book and then the rest sort of became ho hum and can this please end soon while my comments don t sound nice i could see why the book lasted as many pages as it did and my protest comes from not usually readi
7285,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,2,a traditional coming of age story embedded in a frame story with untrustworthy narrative voice a bit of magic humans only shallow descriptions of different cultures some very unbelievable bits of setting e g half of the boys dying during education really some wrong facts e g sharp swords to cut through plate mail this is not the greatest piece of world building that you ve ever read and it is missing the sense of wonder some might like the direct prose without lyric ambitions

7287,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,3,i found blood song to be a gripping coming of age tale with better than fair character and setting development i enjoyed the single point of view perspective and the pacing is good — except for a few places when the timeline changed suddenly and without warning or the actions and attitudes of the players didn t seem to match their ages or time spent at the school also while i didn t feel the protagonist vaelin al sorna did anything out of character the meat of his motives was sometime
7288,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,last night i finished blood song by anthony ryan it s been a while since i ve loved a book so much i found the writing pacing and story to be excellent with a subtle but powerful magic woven throughout the story in a number of ways the story borrows from your typical boy becomes a hero of the realm pattern but it constantly veers in directions i found fascinating it s tempting to rave about this book for many many pages but i ll avoid the temptation and choose my highlights first i
7290,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,this was one hell of a story with great characters and solid pacing brother al sorna s tale drew me in early emotionally and didn t really let go ryan presents a different take on coming of age at a hard ass combat school with significant trials and also different from a fantasy genre perspective in that those within the school of the order and the faith are opposed to magic i particularly enjoyed the bond formed between vaelin and his brothers and the strong sense of loyalty prevalent
7292,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,i was swept away by this book the main character vaelin was truly a virtus theme so were others in the cast it is a gritty world very medieval in feeling but i found the setting mysterious and well crafted there is great humor as well as drama and you care about the band of brothers from the sixth order kind of a hogwarts for assassins the strong language was a turn off for me my only real complaint it s not as dark as grrm and had some very intricate subplots loved all the twists and

7299,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4, i listened to the audiobook i enjoyed the book the story and the characters once i got into the book a little of a slowish start the story builds up through the training and character building to a good ending of particular note the variation in narrator / pov i really liked the limited view of the numst person narration of the historian and the conflict in truths between the story being told to him and the one we hear it was cleverly done 
7300,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,3,i wish i would have liked it better the writing was there the characterization was there the magic system was there but god it just plodded along and the mc gary stu i had the same problem with name of the wind so maybe first person chronological stories just aren t for me i don t know

7338,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,i really really wish i could give this a num num or a num/num such a great read some parts seemed a bit slow but when the pace picks up it really picks up i really liked how we grew up with vaelin and anthony was able to make it interesting usually i get bored with books where you go through the hero s training as a kid but he made it work really well really happy with this book
7339,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,5,incredible a haunting tale that is both beautifully composed and magical in every way blood song reminded me of books from my youth a more traditional vein of fantasy single pov coming of age story and mysterious magic it was like catching up with an old friend a truly impressive debut num/num stars

7348,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,num/num review once i started reading this book i can count on two hands how many times i put it down for a break each time it was with a deep sigh of regret that i couldn t continue reading due to some pesky obligation like work or sleep this book took a hold of my attention and i read it like my life depended on it any book that can have that effect on me gets num stars without a second thought vaelin al sorna is a prisoner he s spent the last num years in dungeons he is hated by everyone around h
7349,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,the main reasons why i picked this book up were the high goodreads rating and the many comparisons of it being quite similar to patrick rothfuss’ name of the wind they re both epic fantasy coming of age stories with overly talented yet hard working main characters but i find that the broad similarities end there but it really has been a while since i read name of the wind so i might be mistaken this is one of the books that does the circular plot pattern quite well only in the last few
7350,Blood Song,Anthony Ryan,4,how to rate a book worthy of the hype but is far from perfect a story that as a whole is better than the sum of its parts that even after days of completing it is not faded into white noise it defies personal logic why a book i would objectively rate num stars is whimsically promoted to num num stars just because storytelling wise blood song simply killed it relentlessly plot driven the story breaks no ground insofar as epic fantasies go recently bereft num year old vaelin al sorna is adop
7351,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,i literally don t remember when i read my first tamora pierce book all i can tell you is that it was alanna the first adventure and it was probably an audiobook that my parents checked out for one of our infinite family road trips i can t have been much older than say third grade at a stretch after that first one needless to say i was addicted yes i read lioness rampant in elementary school it was educational then again i was already into pern by then so i also don t remembe
7352,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,i hopped into this book hoping i would not be confused out of my mind i have heard of her tamora pierce s other tortall books especially the enormously popular ones about alanna but the premise of those books didn t interest me i hate to admit it and this is terrible backwards of me but books about cross dressing disguised characters do not interest me this applies to manga as well don t even get me started on how much i hated hanakimi this series about a young girl with animal magic s
7353,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,i loved this story when i was younger and i’m so glad that it hadn’t lost its magic at all even if i’m a bit older now i loved daine in this book and how strong she was she fought so hard to protect people and her animal friends even if she was a bit stubborn at times i also liked the storyline even if i have read this multiple times before i remembered everything that happened but it didn’t spoil the story for me at all i loved the travelling the training the dragon and other magical
7354,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,oh these books are so lovely these are like fairy tales for intelligent empowered girls the problems are black and white the villains have simple motives and the little girls are the heroes i love every minute and i will snatch these up for my daughters and say thank you very much these books are like middle grade or even elementary age fiction that’s been labeled ya because they have mature relationships and by mature relationships i mean young women choosing to be intimate with partn
7355,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,well that was outside my wheelhouse so in my life outside of goodreads aside from the usual adulting that we grown ups do i run an actual sci fi/fantasy book club well we started out as a book club and then expanded to also watching movies drinking wine and generally hanging out and geeking out together about anything science fiction and fantasy related anyways we tend to pick our books by popular vote and tamora pierce was one of the authors whose name was being bandied around freq
7356,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,after a short break i ve returned to tortall and guys it s great to be back i decided to resume my long overdue tamora pierce education for two reasons first the immortals quartet was completely new to me as a kid i had a passing familiarity with the alanna kel and aly series having read a few chapters of each before abandoning them and also i found out that my sister has all four of the books in one volume so i stole it from her sorry borrowed the first book takes place about te

7358,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,2,so i ve read up to page num now and there isn t really anything that urges me to read on i have heard so many good things about this book and tamora pierce s books in general come highly recommended by some of my goodreads friends but i fear that if i haven t found anything that makes me want to go on up until now i probably won t find it in the next num pages either please don t understand this as a discouragement to give pierce s books a try this is in no way a bad book it s just not f
7359,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,wild magic literally changed my life it was the first series i read with a strong girl as the protagonist i read this before her alanna series and i wanted nothing more than to leave my horrible junior high behind and drop into daine s shoes even with all the bad stuff that happens to her i mean the girl can talk to animals this is an older book so while it might have been ya when i was younger it would definitely qualify if as mg these days don t let that scare you there s still so m
7360,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,it was really awesome if only the translator didn t mess it up i admit this was a long reading the translation in indonesian is a mess it should be a delightful reading the story was awesome i never know how much i miss epic fantasy until i read this and get this fulfilment feeling 
7361,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,this is the first instalment in the immortals series this managed to combine all of my favourite fictional elements a complex magic system political intrigue a sprawling fantastical world villains you can truly hate an abundance of animals and the most lovable of friendship groups that had me yearning to become of them and did all of this whilst also creating a unique and consistently exciting story line this may only be my first tamora pierce book but it definitely not be the last 
7362,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,if you have read my other reviews you will know that i am a huge tamora pierce fan though i am now perhaps a little older than her target demographic however despite this i am not blinded to the faults in her writing something which i discovered in the disappointing recent release melting stones so trust me the fact that i ve given this book num stars is because i believe it to be truly deserving of each and every one of them i grew up on a diet of richly rendered fantasy books which inc
7363,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,i received a free ebook version of this book from netgalley thankyou to both netgalley and the publisher for giving me the chance to read this my review is still honest believe it or not this was my first tamora pierce novel because of this i didn t realise until i d started that i should have read the alanna quartet first but i still got the gist of the story and i don t think it impacted my enjoyment/understanding too much wild magic follows daine a young girl with a secret tragic past
7364,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,i think this is my numth or numth reread yeah still a favorite the book that launched my love of tamora pierce some of the appeal of this is lost now that i m an adult and no longer identify so deeply with daine but it was still great this book and this series was so hugely influential in my reading life and i suppose in my life period too 
7365,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,2,two stars but that s not to say i didn t read this in one sitting because i did then again it s not very long in order of least to most frustrating num the note that like her predator friends daine ate meat is pretty interesting definitely important to note and also slightly weird the later distinction that she can t eat anything she shifts to is even more important because it tries to resolve the inherent contradiction between seeing these animals as friends and you know eating

7370,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,after having been so immersed in the full cast audio circle of magic world tortall almost came as a bit of a shock a few familiar voices in different roles made for an odd but not unpleasant experience once i d gotten used to daine again though i remembered how much i had always loved this series too these productions are amazing i don t know what i ll do when i get through them all

7373,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,this was in many ways a book that stole my readers virginity i picked this up in the school library when i was eleven years old ten years ago the cover matching the one i now own was a spider with a mans head and in no way appealed to me but the first chapter titled a girl with a pony drew me in immediately thank god for my horse obsession or i d never have discovered these books and this wonderful author it was my first fantasy book it was my first book not directly related to ho

7379,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,this is by far my very favorite series of tamora pierce s and i think this is my fifth time reading through it they re totally comfort books to me i did read the song of the lioness series first but i don t think you d really have to in order to understand and enjoy this one though that series is definitely good background reading for this one and introduces several of the characters and concepts that show up here it s the main characters in this series daine and numair that i really
7380,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,well this stood up to my memory of it i still prefer it to alanna i think i just do something in daine speaks to me more or maybe i m just a sucker for stories about people finding a home i enjoy daine s relationship with the animals i laughed at her crush on jonathan onua is as awesome as i remember i had forgotten how numair is introduced in this i forgot he could shape shift i giggled when i remembered and the stormwings are still suitably terrifying/creepy i do enjoy numair and d

7384,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,calling all guardian herd fans i think you ll enjoy wild magic by tamora pierce the focus of this series is on animals and horses so what is not to like we follow our main character daine on a wild and magical adventure after she s hired to help move some aggressive and unruly ponies south the setting is medieval ish the writing is to the point in a good way the action is exciting odd beasts abound and most are not friendly and there is a dragon so yeah read it 
7385,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,i had a long car ride with my younger son over the winter holidays and was looking for something for us to listen to while i drove i d liked how the full cast audio recordings had worked for the stories that tamora pierce had written to be released on audiobook first so jumped at the chance to reread wild magic using a different actor for each character works wonderfully during wild magic and i highly recommend the audiobook experience 
7386,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,this book came for my life i honestly can t decide whether i m relieved or regretful that i never read this as a child or teenager i say that because knowing myself and knowing the tropes that turn me into a quivering mass of hyper obsessed jelly i m fully aware that this book would have utterly consumed me possibly in a very unhealthy way though i ve no doubt it would have been a simultaneous blast ✔ an unpretentious empathetic and resourceful heroine finding family after facing loss

7393,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,i loved this series as a kid and it s still good it s of its time the character of sarge is a bit uncomfortable for example and some of the gender politics are very dated don t flirt with the thirteen year old girl twenty year old guy it s not cool but on the whole it s an ace kid s book surprisingly dark full of adventure it s better paced and plotted than the lioness quartet possibly because pierce wasn t trying to cram in a lot of world building and her writing had frankly j
7394,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,i wasn t sure if i d like this new series as much as the alanna series but after the first few pages i did daine is a very different character but equally wonderful and i love numair s flirty sarcasm the animals reminded me of redwall even though it s not quite the same but i liked all of them and seeing daine interact but let s be real the best part seeing old beloved characters eeeeeeeeee every time one of them popped on the page no spoilers from me i fell more in love i love seeing
7395,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,gosh i loved this i have no clue why i waited so long to continue the tortall saga i probably would have read it faster if i realized all my alanna faves popped up here and there in this series as well sure much of the plot could be taken care of with communication but i don t care i love daine i love charming mages i love wild magic and naughty ponies i might love those most of all

7400,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,i liked most parts of this book but i really found it a little difficult to get into it i liked daine and uona i prob spelled that wrong i would ve liked for daine to have been a little more mature but i guess since these series is a long one it makes sense that she is really young i liked that she was able to communicate with the animals and that she was able to have them do what they needed they also alerted them when they were in danger or danger was approaching i was surprised when nu
7401,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,i loved this book all of the twist were really good like the castle being attacked while some of the warriors are drawn away i also loved how when you thought you knew daine s secret something comes up and you suddenly feel as if daine was different

7404,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,even though i loved being in the tortall world and seeing numair and alanna i really didn t love daines narration the story was bogged down by the endless meditation scenes i do plan on finishing the whole series this month because i never actually read it all the way through but after this first book that doesn t actually shock me

7417,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,wild magic was the first book i ever read by fantasy teen writer tamora pierce and continues to be my favourite it may help slightly if you have read pierce s previous song of the lioness quartet but certainly not necessary — i didn t get round to reading it until several years later wild magic is the first book of the immortals quartet and in my opinion the best series of stories that pierce has to offer placing her immensely likeable heroine daine amidst a backdrop of magical upheaval 
7418,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,this was a quick easy read but there s really nothing special or outstanding about it i think it kind of sets up the character of daine but it seemed like it moved from one thing to another introducing new ideas a little too quickly i didn t like it quite as well as the alanna series daine is a likable enough character and there are some returning characters from the alanna series there are also a few new ones as well but no one that grabbed me and although i liked the end of this stor

7422,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,aw i liked this book a lot i think pierce s writing has improved somewhat over the early alanna books not that it was bad before but this is just delightful the magic especially was great in this book i loved getting to talk to the different kinds of animals and see how they think whales are hardcore pacifists apparently view spoiler [but it s all good because you can just release the kraken hide spoiler ] i love the character of daine and i hope the other books in this series are ab
7423,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,beautiful enchanting magical wonderful and endearing i have finally found a book to call it mine yes i have read fair amout of young adult books that i really enjoyed and loved but nothing has touched me so close to my heart than this book i knew i would like it before i read it considering it was about a girl with power to convince heal and converse with animals as a little girl i d dream of such power there is no super hero heroine in this world i d rather be i savored every pa
7424,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,the immortals series of which this is the first follows the adventures of daine a girl who discovers that she has powerful animal magic she can speak to animals command them and even shape shift eventually i liked the characters and the nicely cohesive overarching plot carried out through all four books and i appreciated the thought given to the ethics of animal magic of being able to control them for human purposes by the end though daine and her cohorts are almost too powerful 
7425,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,this book was full of fantasy maybe even a little too much for my liking sometimes the whole part about the immortals and all the crazy creatures made the plot a bit confusing in the end though everything came together and all the loose ends were tied up i really liked how this book gave me an outsider s daine s view on tortall jon alanna thayet etc contrary to the previous quartet which was from alanna s view i think that daine is such an interesting character and i can t wait to r
7426,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,really a num num i very much enjoyed this book and thought it was a fun and creative ya novel the full cast audio edition was great to listen to personally i would have enjoyed more in the way of plot this was a very character driven book while the characters were great i felt more plot was needed to balance the book further many questions were left unanswered in this novel however this is a series and the weaknesses i saw may resolve as the series continues 
7427,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,while i like diane i ll never love her the way i do alanna and kel i don t know why and it s not really fair but her story never grasped me the same way but that doesn t mean i don t still enjoy this quartet and especially the first book is great fun hearing her reactions to meeting the characters we know and love from song of the lioness is always interesting 
7428,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,there s nothing i can say that will adequately express how i feel about these books and i m not even going to try besides the fact that i read them all repeatedly i quit counting after the numth time is the highest form of praise i can give anyway daine numair and the others are friends as dear to me as any in this world 
7429,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,absolutely lovely novel i love the characters and all the imagery in it i can’t wait to continue on in this series incidentally this was one of the first books i read by pierce and i remembered absolutely nothing about it
7430,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,i liked this pierce series almost as much as i liked the alanna keladry books 
7433,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,what a great book for the horse girl in all of us
7434,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,i m really into this character and this book series it s definitely not as great as when i read it as a child also there is a problematic relationship 
7435,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,this book reminded me of the harper hall pern series with animals instead of fire lizards this series takes place after the lioness but before lianne 
7436,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,review taken from the pewter wolf eproof was given from uk publisher harper voyager via netgalley in exchange for an honest review i have always been aware of tamora pierce for many years i’ve been aware of her since my preteens i know she’s a big deal in the fantasy genre but because she’s a big deal i always felt that she would be unaccessible so when news came out that harpervoyager was going to republish the immortals quartet and the first book in her series tempests and slaugh
7437,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,when she finds herself orphaned and on the run daine uses her knack with animals to get a position with a horse handler looking for an assistant but there s more to daine s knack than meets the eye she can actually talk to animals her unusual skill set brings her into contact with the highest levels of tortall society the kingdom s fate may rest on her ability to master her talents and communicate with her animal friends i was a huge fan of the song of the lioness quartet as a child but
7438,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,do you remember that time when you read a book and it made your heart sing that’s what wild magic did to me i felt so wonderfully absorbed whilst reading it and all i wanted to know was what was going to happen next i’ll start with a caveat– wild magic is not a young adult ya book anymore it was written when ya was slightly differently classified than how it is today i would classify it as middle grade mg as there’s a lot of innocence in it and it’s that coming of age story that grabbed
7439,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,2,i bought this book in num as a pre teen and thought it would be a great style of book for me it has a female protagonist magic and horses what could be better well the actual writing of the story could be better as i found it really lacked coherence i started reading this book in num and i know this because it had a ticket stub from the butterfly conservatory in niagara falls as a bookmark i don t think i made it much past the first chapter back in num as per the location of the ticket
7440,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,originally posted at chain interaction don’t get me wrong alanna was a phenomenal protagonist but something about daine just clicked with me maybe it was her connection with animals maybe it was her fear of her own madness i don’t know suffice it to say that i fell hard for daine i loved her i want to read fifty books from her perspective and i couldn’t wait to keep reading more this book captured all of the things i love about books with animals and just kept running with them i ador
7441,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,this was such an amazing story i listened to this on audio and it has effects an a full cast it was pretty amazing this was my first foray into ms pierce s book and i was a little afraid that because this book is so old it won t have aged well but i was wrong it didn t disappoint at all daine our main character was num and she actually felt num she didn t feel like an adult talking you could hear the immaturity of her age in her words and i loved her for that she is empathetic and strong bu
7442,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,a friend and i were discussing books that we had read during our childhood and she brought up tamora pierce she was shocked to learn i had never read the author and immediately gave me her favorite book to read thus i began wild magic pierce’s writing style is quite simple there are many minor repetitions a character grinned four times in the space of two paragraphs and frankly her descriptions can be rushed saying that her plot writing is charming and magical i found myself intrig
7443,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,while of course alanna is always close to my heart as the first tpierce and really ya fantasy text i ever read at age num or num wild magic shows such a development in writing skill and world building i think maybe its because alanna is kind of fast paced the first book ranges over like num years as do the others whereas in wild magic the text covers only a few months i love the slow paced development of daine from her fear of her magic to developing skills i love her uncertaint
7444,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,this has to be my absolute favourite series by tamora pierce i was a little scared for the re read because i was a bit worried that it wouldn t hold up to my memories but i am happy that wasn t the case daine has always been very close to animals despite not having the gift there seems to be something magical about the way that she can communicate with them when daine has to flee her home she is offered a job working with horses that changes her life now she s on the road to tortall wi
7445,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,this book is perfect i can t believe i haven t read it before why aren t stories told like this anymore it s clear to see from this novel why tamora pierce is a queen in children s and ya literature this novel contained fully formed characters who were kind and loving intense and emotional conflicts and a myriad cast full of differing ages races and genders i frankly went into this book expecting the unrealistic rendering of childhood i felt in alanna s story but while daine perhaps
7446,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,this book about a num year old girl is an engaging book for the girl that likes fantasy and adventure and it will hook the boys too i enjoyed reading this a second time i especially as a teacher enjoyed the hook in the epilogue that will catch the kids and get them to read another book if you are looking for a coming of age i m not sure of myself fantasy adventure book this is it many kids will identify with daine as she goes about learning about herself and the world it will also give
7447,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,tamora pierce will always and forever be one of my childhood favorites while i was originally more partially to the circle universe books i believe i have officially found i love these also daine is an expressive character finding herself while she harnesses a magic seldom seen in humans her journey is full of emotion adventure and wonderful friends numair alanna and george are especially lovely though i ve also experienced them in her other trickster books wonderful experience where t
7448,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,tamora pierce’s writing is so understated the stories are simple and yet you feel so connected to the characters i loved daine’s character i would have been so jealous of her as a teen talking to animals how cool as always women rule in the land of tortall and i loved seeing the king’s champion knight alanna again especially running off to fight ogres while her husband stays home with their children ❤ can’t waif to continue the series 
7449,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,i do love this book i love the magic and the world the strong female characters and the unconventional royalty i also love the immortals and the unnaturalness of them daine does happen to have some extraordinary luck in terms of her own abilities and her choice of friends but i m willing to let that slide because when i first read this as a num year old it was exactly what i wished my world would morph into and i can t forget that 
7450,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,i am pleasantly surprised by this first in a quartet of books about daine and her wild magic i expected a lot to do with horses and that happened in the early part but after the arrival at the capital and then some all kinds of things happened no romance although i suspect that may happen as daine gets older by the end of the book i am certain that daine is a lot more than a horse whisperer the only reason it is not num stars is well kind of a cliff hanger ending enjoyable read 
7451,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,i always passed on this series because i don t go crazy over stories about mages or people who can speak with animals but as always with tamora pierce the characters drew me in an interesting perspective for me having read about numair s history in tempests and slaughter before this authentic character driven spare language and seems leisurely paced until you reach the end and discover you have whiplash 
7452,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,i really enjoyed this book i liked the world and the characters and the power of the main character because i’m all for animal talking and how she evolved and grow up in this book and how we learn about her past and how she slowly grew more comfortable around other human and she’s smart and brave and even if it was a bit slow at times i liked it a lot and i can’t wait to read more about this world
7453,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,wild magic is a fantastic story it’s full of adventure and surprises diane learning to control her magic is fascinating and the animals she speaks with have such personality i love reading about alanna after she grew up and in between the older books it’s fun to hear her from other peoples perspective i highly recommend this book to people who enjoy adventure animals and a bit of wild magic 
7454,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,pretty good book but not as good as the first book of the lioness series it s good to see alanna again and all her children didn t really peg her as a mother so it will be interesting to see how she progresses over time with more character development i like the new character daine a lot as well a complete personality change from who alanna was as a child can t wait to see her adventures 
7455,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,i first read this series when i was in high school and it is what got me started on reading fantasy rereading it not i was happy that i still really enjoyed it definitely a step on in pierce s writing too as the book feels more fleshed out and not as eager to speed through time as the song of the lioness quartet very much looking forward to the next one 
7456,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,this was one of my favourite series as a kid i re read it several times if i remember correctly just love any fantasy that involves communicating with animals plus there were some great characters one day i d love to re read all these books from my childhood 
7457,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,i wish i could talk to animals 
7458,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,i could read this series over and over and over again oh wait i have 
7459,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,a start of another great series by tamora pierce i love that she added in so many mystical creatures in this one 
7460,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,fast paced and engaging though a little bit simplistic 
7462,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,i ve probably reread this almost as often as the entire song of the lioness series and it is still frelling fantastic but i m particularly biased where the lioness is concerned 
7463,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,more brown people 🎉 some of them main characters 🎉 mostly not weirdly othered or saved by white feminism 👍
7464,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,love numair and daine this series is going to be a wild ride 
7466,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,a fun read for kids i can see why this was my co workers favorite as a child go figure she s now a veterinarian 
7467,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,finally back in this world again after how many years num num too long that s for sure i loved seeing alanna and the old cast of characters again i ve missed them a lot i loved seeing them interact with daine and numair can t wait to continue reading this quartet 
7468,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,forgot how much i liked daine as a character and how interesting wild magic was the plot is a little episodic and weak but you can’t have everything 
7469,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,it s so nice to be back in the world of tortall i ll be honest i was not daine s biggest fan but she grew on me this adventure was less interesting but i feel it was building up toward something more it was fantastic to see alanna george jon and their children i am looking forward to how this story develops and delving into it further 
7470,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,i loved this book so much as a kid that my copy is literally falling apart — what higher praise can i give it it’s still a really satisfying read as an adult although i think wolf speaker may be on the balance my favorite daine book and i look forward to sharing it with the next generation someday 
7471,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,this would have been my favorite book if i d have read it as a young teen they re short the language is plain and all the animals are the friends of the protagonist daine overall very few original ideas she has special powers and doesn t know her dad and surprise he turns out to be a big deal later in the series there also isn t really any conflict in the story other than let s defeat the bad guys and occasional teen moodiness from daine 
7472,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,i read this on audio book the main character dane was created with a past so the story moves you into her future the entertaining quality of the book holds the readers attention it is an excellent fantasy adventure even the animals have feelings ideas and friendships it s a series book so you can look forward to reading more about these characters 
7473,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,num/num stars the immortals series has been one of my absolute favorites since i’ve started reading fantasy novels it was the series that actually got me hooked on fantasy as a genre i first read it in middle school and for the first time num years later i started to reread it i remember loving it but num years is a long time and whole different life stage mainly i bought the series because a new edition with the amazing cover pictured above was released and i had to have it i remembered the g
7474,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5, final rating num num stars catchall it must first be said that my review of this book and the following three books of the series are not in any way first impressions i have read these books several times over the years and only write a review now as i was asked to review these books to celebrate the newest release of the novels i must admit that i still found this book every bit as magical as i did the very first time i read it the heroine veralidaine sarrasri daine is an incredibly
7475,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,i hadn t read this book since i was perhaps num or num but for my nostalgia month i dug it out from the back of the bookshelf since i felt it did have a distinct place in my mind and in my book history i bought it one summer while my family was vacationing in oklahoma with it i bought two other books which i feel definitely had huge impacts on my interests and reading for years although wild magic really wasn t a part of that transformation i did like the book and read the entire series whe
7476,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,because i needed to become invested in another amazing series needed to i mean i couldn t really pass up more tamora pierce could i and i pretty much consider this series part of the whole tamora pierce world so it s not new new right what was written daine is thirteen years old and for as long as she can remember she s had a special connection with animals it s not however until she is forced to leave her family home that she realizes it s more than a connection it s magic taking on
7477,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,wild magic follows the song of the lioness series and is the beginning of daine’s story a num year old girl from galla a country to the north of tortall who was orphaned shortly before the story begins when daine meets onua horsemistress of the queen’s riders of tortall at a fair and secures work as onua’s assistant she’s unaware that her life will greatly change daine has a strong connection with mammalian animals she’s able to communicate with them and even influence them in other ways 
7478,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,i loved this book it pulled me in by letting me find everything out right along with the main character who also had a lot of secrets and a scary past that she was hiding those came out gradually very compelling of course the next thing i did was go to the library and check out every other tamora pierce book on the shelf only to find that a lot of the others are nowhere near as good i thought at first it was that phenomenon where you think the first book you read by a particular author is
7479,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,re read on num/num/num it is just as good as it was the first time i read it this is probably my numrd re read i have to wait a couple of years to read this series again and again because i remember it so well this is my fav series of tp s daine is my fav character too re read numth time num/num/num i still adore this book and series so happy num when i was a junior or senior in h s my eng teacher took our class on a trip to our library that was my first time at the schools library the librarian too
7480,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,wouldn t it be fun if you could talk to animals what would you say what would they say better yet what if you could become an animal how would it feel if you had the body of a hawk but you still had your mind that would be cool you d have the keen eyesight of the bird and the ability to fly what if you could be a wolf you d have such a strong sense of smell what instincts would you feel pulling on you what would it feel like i have loved animals my whole life and i feel a strong conn
7481,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,when my friend told me about this book i was a bit skeptical though i usually trust my friend s judgement on other matters books are usually off limits now i will read books when my friends really want me to like the green glass sea when one of my friends was literally trying to force us to read it even threatening to read it allowed to us i suppose i shouldn t say i don t like to read books my friends tell me to read i just don t trust them when they start telling my that i will love a bo
7482,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,i loved this book yet again i always feel for poor daine losing her mother at such a young age her fear that she went mad and that it might return i love the premise that she can communicate with animals i always wanted that power i look forward to the next book update august numst num i never realized before or at least noticed that daine was so country she was very surprised and confused by how backwards and relaxed the royalty and nobles were in tortall at least she was able to swi
7483,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,since i was a little girl i ve had a ridiculous love for all little furry feathery or scaly beasties i won t deny that it borders on ridiculous as i ve spent copious amounts of time chatting to the neighbourhood cats rescuing baby squirrels and damaged pigeons adopting my own cats and generally fussing over every animal i come across needless to say my husband is an endlessly patient man which isn t surprising since my eldest cat topaz personally picked him for me you think i m kidding
7484,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,this is one of those books that susie lent to me when we did our “books we read when we were in middle school or thereabouts” swap this series takes place a few years after the end of the alanna series i reviewed last time the heroine this time around is daine thirteen years old orphaned homeless and oh she can communicate with animals she can mind speak with them and therefore she understands much more about “the people” as they refer to themselves than your average human this is dai
7485,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,i happened across this book when i could not find the second book in the protector of the small series at my school library i noticed that it was from the same author and decided that i would give it a try this book is very much different from protector of the small though it is set i the same world and appears to be the prequel series to that one now that i look back at it the main character is veralidaine sarrasri or diane for short she starts off as being an assistant horse caretaker for
7486,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,this is the book i love how the author gets to stretch her wings here and show us some more of the scope of the incredible land she s imagined for us the countries she hinted at in alanna are not just names suggestions on a map they exist they have legends religions histories and cultures no artificial depth here alanna is extremely special to me and a large part of who i am i just named a horse that looks like moonlight after her d but i think daine and her wild magic have my heart i
7487,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,the previous books in the series all took me a couple days at least wild magic i read in less than num hours why because it s the best thing ever put to paper ever ever ever seriously so first of all i absolutely adore that this is a whole new book in a whole new series with a new protagonist new magic and many new characters it s a new coming of age story too with its own themes very different from those of song of the lioness yet it was also sort of a continuation of the previous
7488,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,one day a girl with a knack with animals came to a grand fair in cría the capital of galla young daine was looking for work handling horses when she came apron onua horse mistress of the queen s riders in tortall she hires daine but is wary for daine is lying to her in some way tension picks up when creatures from the divine realms that had all but been forgotten by humankind onua finds an old friend in trouble and has daine try to save him while onua calls for help help arrives in the
7489,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,what i liked daine she was a little younger than me but she was intelligent caring and she had a unique bond with animals i loved her powers and the bond she shared with cloud secondary cast one thing i like about tamora pierce is she includes her previous characters in her new series alanna has always been a favorite of mine and she made an appearance in this book as well george was also in this book and he was always a favorite too and it was nice to see how he and alanna’s life w
7490,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,daine has gone through quite a lot in her young life her family has been killed and she has been on her own for a while she meets up with onua the horsemistress for the queen s riders she is hired on because of her way with animals and they start the trek back to tortall with a herd of ponies along the way they see some of the monsters that have begun invading the lands daine also saves shape shifting mage numair when he is hurt and poisoned daine starts to learn more about her wild magic
7491,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,wild magic by tamora pierce is a magical journey that gives new understanding to what it means to be magical in this series daine the protagonist is a young girl that has rejoined civilization after losing her family to raiders and bandits the story starts out by describing how she got a job working for a housemistress that needs a assistance daine is skeptical about opening up to her about her past and is scared of how it would effect there growing friendship as their journey rages on t
7492,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,i just re read this and i love it more now then i have ever loved it if that is even possible book num of a num book series daine is num and an orphan her mother grandda and ll her animal friends were both killed by bandits except for cloud her horse who was with her on an errand for her mother none of the townspeople who her mother helped came to check on them she was all alone and took up with a pack of wolves to track down the bandits and get revenge but what you need to understand about
7493,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,2,num num stars i was interested in reading the book due to the fact that the main girl daine had a power of communicating with animals this was the most interesting feature of the story though not enough to keep me interested unfortunately for the plot and structure of the book seemed very disjointed i had trouble understanding what was happening at certain points and the motivations for what was occurring there was a lot of traveling throughout the book and so i guess it seemed unsettled to
7494,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,ok so i just got home from visiting my family in utah while i was there i finished the book i brought so i visited my adolescent book shelf still filled with all my books and pulled out one of my favorite series tamora pierce s alanna series i loved it all over again the girl who trades places with her twin brother to become the first woman warrior in centuries you know woman power and fantasy at its best anyway i finished that series and found out that this is the second in a set of
7495,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,in this first volume of a series pierce returns to the world and characters she introduced in her song of the lioness fantasy epic here she tells the story of daine a num year old orphaned girl with an extraordinary talent for communicating with animals the teenager is swept up in the first skirmishes of a war and is forced to master her fears and learn how to marshall her magical abilities trying to make the sequel to four previous novels stand on its own is no mean feat and pierce has a
7496,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,it took me way too long to read this book but it s not really the book s fault i kept getting waylaid by book club books num year old comics and books for school with that said this is a nice continuation of the song of the lioness series it opens up the magical elements adds several new characters and catches us up with several of the key players from the first series i m num sure you could enjoy it without reading the earlier books but that s hard for me to say since y know i ve
7497,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,not bad really considerably better than some of her more recent novels such as the trickster series a fairly classic tale in the poor young misunderstood child discovers she s really incredibly special / talented and finds a new family substitute along the way vein mercedes lackey and anne mccaffery are also famous for them frankly they don t have to be all that good as long as the world is reasonably interesting and the characters basic enough that we can imagine ourselves as one of
7498,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,in the first book in this series daine a num year old girl is capable of communicating with animals although this sounds interesting the way the author handled it was more annoying than anything else daine is an orphan who is trying to develop her skills while a war is going on in her journeys she becomes an apprentice to a mage who helps her develop her magical skills using her skills daine senses new beings known as immortals trying to break into her world her and her friends now mu
7499,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,this book was amazing i was so happy to see alanna in this book and that she has children and is still with george god i love george lol thayet and jon have their own kids and are in the story as well i love the character daine i was definitly a little worried in the beginning with a new character and new story but i love daine as much as i love alanna daine has wild magic where she can talk to heal and even control animals she has so much spirit like alanna did in this first book
7500,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,i love love love this series in some ways i may even like “the immortals” series better than “song of the lioness” although that’d be an extremely difficult decision the thing that’s so appealing about daine is that she’s not noble she’s just a normal girl that has been thrown into some very odd circumstances she’s feisty overwhelmed learning a lot and not afraid to protect her own it’d be unrealistic for all the characters in the tortall realm to be intense fighters one of the best thi
7501,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,oh i m so glad i m rereading this series this was the first tortall book i read i practically had it memorized by the end of middle school and i admit trepidation as to whether it d hold up to reading as an adult but it does hold up beautifully daine remains a wonderful perspective character numair is a ridiculous stork mage and i d forgotten how much i adore onua and cloud having just finished rereading the song of the lioness i found the development of pierce s writing style even more
7502,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,i thoroughly enjoyed this tale of daine the animal whisperer and her adventures in tortall daine is a mage but doesn t know it yet numair the king s mage knows it and is training her to wield her wild magic daine is the hero who saves the day when invaders attack her new home she draws all the animals land and sea to fight the invaders consist of immortals which are fantasy creatures griffins ogres dragons and human/animal hybrids that were once sealed in another kingdom but
7503,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,i really liked this book and tamora pierce is as awesome as ever but daine was just a bit lacking in a way that i can only describe as being not alanna daine is a great person who i like respect and enjoy but sometimes i get a bit resentful she is amazing at archery and can talk to animals and stuff which is cool but she didn t really do any work to earn her powers that passed her all the heroism unlike alanna i m being a bit unfair to daine but i just think of it as a bit unfair to ala
7504,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,so i m not sure what my original rating of this was it was given num stars in gr when i entered it num years after reading it i had a tendency to give any book i couldn t specifically remember a num assuming that i neither loved it nor hated it so all i can say is that i really enjoyed it this time though i did have a hard time with view spoiler [ the whole daine and numair thing difficult because he s like num years older than her and her teacher and i m pretty sure that i remember from
7505,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,less a review of the book and more a review of my audiobook experience i have read this book before but never finished the series i just got busy and it fell to the side since i still wanted to finish the series i decided to try this as my first audiobook experience this was a full cast audiobook where tamora pierce did the narration and a whole cast of people did the voices for the different characters it was good though i do now wonder what i ll think of a single narrator book i wonde
7506,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,picked this up because i was curious to see what s happening in the realm of ya fantasy got to meet daine and follow her as she finds a new set of companions both human and animal after her own family was slaughtered daine has a definite knack with animals both for communication and healing as she and her horse travel they take up with characters from another series of pierce but this book stands alone from the other series no worries as daine learns the depths and extend of her wi
7507,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,whenever i m asked which of tamora pierce s series i like best i always say the immortals quartet i m not sure if that s true in fact while i m reading her other works in that moment that particular story is my favorite likewise protector of the small is my least favorite until i read it at which point i box my own ears and wonder how on earth i could have thought that anyways i do love wild magic it s a perfect introduction to daine s adventures in learning how to control her mag
7508,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,wild magic has everything that preteens and young teenagers love magic animals a strong female lead the promise that excitement exists outside of our every day drudgery but older teens and adults will feel much less inclined to finish this novel as an eighth grader i loved this book so much that i used it for a project in which i got to pick the cast of the movie when i gave the class presentation i just kept raving about it and the teacher had to ask me to sit down as an adult i ve
7509,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,i was feeling a bit depressed so i thought that reading a nice adult coming of age fantasy would be the perfect solution and this is the series by tamora pierce that was next on my to read list seemed perfect and i was pretty much right this more than any of the other books by tamora pierce that i ve read reminded me of mercedes lackey s earlier valdemar books poor bereaved and bereft daine is taken in discovered to have amazing talents and ultimately saves the day with them after a b
7510,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,not much to say here this is the third series i read from tamora pierce i read the lionness quartet first which was aimed at quite a young audience then i read beka cooper which it seems to me is a little older now i move on to this series and the protagonist is all of num years old which stunted my enthusiasm a little it s pretty typical tropey even girl with special powers mysterious origin tragic/traumatic experience she gets more and more special doing favors for barons and qu
7511,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,in all seriousness who really thought i wouldn t like this no one that s who in my triumphant return to tortall a year after finishing alanna i was absolutely not disappointed i love this book so much and this series already it is a little bittersweet to return and see alanna and jon and george and know that i missed nine years and that i m not following them but i fell in love with daine onua and numair almost immediately i ve been listening to the audiobook in my car as well
7512,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,num num stars i wish i wish i wish that i had found this book as a kid it was amazing i don t even know what to say this book had all of the magic and magical creatures i have ever wanted in a fantasy book plus an amazing main character and a cast of great side characters our main character daine can talk to animals which was my childhood dream and she has magical abilities including learning how to heal animals and maybe even fantastical creatures like dragons i mean it s amazing 😍
7513,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,alanna always has a place in my heart being the first tammy series i read but daine is especially close because of her affinity with animals i haven t read this series in close to ten years and the only thing i could remember from that first read was that i didn t like daine as much as alanna or kel and now that i m back to reading her i d love to throttle my num year old self and say what the hell is wrong with you this girl is literally perfect i don t know that there s anything cuter
7514,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,this was so good if the rest of this series is like this i will be so so happy view spoiler [important things magelet numair the fact that daine s secret was not kept forever everyone onua alanna george buri thayet even jon and daine s friends and all the kids daine s struggle with her animal friends dragons hide spoiler ] also again it s because in part i am starving for this but it is so important to me that there are actually people of color in this
7515,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,considering this book is basically about a girl who can communicate with animals not to mention the fact that it takes place in tortall with alanna and george and jon and thayet plus their kids it really shouldn t be too surprising how phenomenal this book was i was so impressed with the way it was done i was envisioning a wild thornberrys type of story but i never considered the idea of having the animals help fight battles with you i say again phenomenal amazing favorite favorite fa
7516,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,2,i know tamora pierce is capable of creating well rounded characters this can be seen in her circle of magic books i also know that her tortall series is her most popular books maybe it s because i don t have enough nostalgia built up around this series i really didn t like alanna because i thought she was too perfect but i find daine even more whiny and irritating that and even her magic isn t as interesting as alanna s i will say that the plot is a bit faster moving than the alanna serie
7517,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,this is the numth story of tortall i have read somehow i started at the end of the series before i realized there was a connection between the stories so far i have enjoyed this book the most daine has a tortured past and a magical connection to animals which she both cherishes and fears hired by the royal horsemistress to drive ponies to tortall daine meets a mage who takes her as an apprentice although i already know daine from later books it didn t disappoint in any way to go back and lea
7518,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,i recently decided to reread this old favorite wild magic is the first book in the immortals series the book focuses on daine a young woman who has wild magic which gives her the ability to communicate with animals while the focus on learning to be a mage reminds me more of the circle of magic series also excellent the tortall setting is always a joy to revisit thanks to the likable characters fast moving pace and thrilling story wild magic remains a great read despite the fact th
7519,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,in the first book of the immortals quartet daine is accepted as an assistant by the horsemistress of the queen’s riders a group of young people from tortall who are trained as a mobile infantry her past history has made her afraid of contact with humans but the wild magic she possesses allows her to contact and communicate with all forms of wild animals and the animals seek her out for help and companionship as she blends into the community of the people of tortall her powers earn her a stro
7520,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,this is a review of a several times re read daine is fun although upon re read i forgot how easy of a time she has as compared to some of the other heroines in the series she s op as i still love it and the enjoyment could still be had in spite of the immensely awful audio reading this is a case of the author who should absolutely have been told by someone who loved her that she s not good at reading aloud phew and then to add to that the cast is also awful not as bad as the narration
7521,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,this was the first book i ever read of tamora pierce it not only hooked me for the quartet it hooked me for life since then i have nonstop read anything set in the tortall universe pierce weaves tales with little to no holes and the stories are so entrancing that any grievances with her story telling must go unnoticed daine is the most modest of personalities in this the first book and as you turn the page she grows into a fire that can’t be stopped this is a must read series of any gir
7522,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,an immensely enjoyable read which engulfs you in a realm beyond belief brought to life through pierce s descriptions ingenuity and sheer talent with particular enthrallment wrapped around the characters as they ease through the plot the book is filled with magic and fantastic mythical creatures such as dragons griffins and stormwings add to that suspense and drama and interactions with animals like wolves horses and bats the books are so well written and so imaginative it is definitely
7523,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,really awesome story i loved the great majority of the characters and the story was written in a way that kept me interested the entire time i thought the ending was a little too abrupt but otherwise a great book would definitely recommend it wasn t really what i was expecting though but in a good way especially because the beginning of the book makes it seem like the story is going one way and then suddenly it takes on a whole other unexpected course 
7524,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,2,this book was okay it was boring i really struggled getting through this book the book had an interesting and not very clear theme i felt that it was set in the future but the future was still in the past compared to now i thought that it could have been much better written the preview on the book was up talked more than what the book had in it over all it was okay but i would not read it again 
7525,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,num num stars what a cool book i m really glad i read the first alanna book before trying this one although i would recommend reading all of them first if you don t want her series spoiled for you in my case i d already accidentally spoiled a lot because i needed to see whether or not the cat was ok in the end haha you could really read any of pierce s quartets in any order you like i think and you should read them i know i m definitely coming back for more 
7526,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,this was the first book i ever read by tamora pierce and this series will always be among my favorites the characters are what does it daine numair cloud ona the list goes on and on plus the continuation of several characters from song of the lioness appear like george prince jonathon queen tyett and of course alanna herself daine s wild magic is so fascinating and all the immortals gods and creature alike are just as interesting overall a great opening to an amazing series 
7527,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,this series consumed my youth i loved these novels as a kid after re reading i understand why things i liked great character development interesting fast paced plot there are no lags in the story the world and the characters are charismatic and beautiful tactful dealing with difficult issues things i didn t like sometimes predictable somewhat optimistic many of the plans succeed i would like to see more struggle 
7528,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,loved this one as much in num as i did all the times i ve read it before daine is sweet and spunky and pierce is second to none when writing young girls coming into their own the supporting cast both animal and human are all a delight and i laughed out loud more than once at their antics i m biased of course for me rereading this book feels like nothing so much as catching up with an old friend 
7529,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,this is the book i needed when i was a thirteen year old with untamed hair and too much love for horses and wolves and dragons this is the book i have been trying to write but didn t have the skill for it s enchanting with lovable characters amazing writing beautifully and artfully developed magic an established world and a satisfying reading experience emotionally and logically can t believe this is the first tamora pierce i ve read it won t be the last 
7530,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,first tamora pirce book i have read and actually liked thus far i ll see how the rest of the series goes before i get too excited daine was an easy character to like as were most of the secondary ones most of whom are from the lioness quartet daine s magic is vague but then it usually is in tortall 
7531,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,i had to reread it as i found the whole wild magic series at the used bookstore i love the tortall books makes me want to reread alana s story but daine is a favorite as well so good a girl finds out her magic is needed and appreciated and her skills are amazing she explores and learns valuable lessons becomes strong and makes wonderful friends and family 
7532,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,definitely ya fantasy definitely tamora pierce which means i really enjoy it more complex than song of lioness series in tortall which it succeeds less so than the trickster s choice series which follows it mostly i m reading to fill out the backstory of this world before moving onto her later books but am digging this on its own merits in the meantime 
7533,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,i found this whole series on audiobook by full cast audio on hoopla i have read the immortals series a dozen times at least and this audiobook recording does it full justice there are maybe num num character readers per book and tamora pierce voices the main narration i completely recommend this book in print or audio for anyone who loves animals magic or young adult fantasy 
7534,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,daine oh daine i love you the immortals quartet has always been my favorite part of the tortall universe it s been quite a while since i reread it but i still love it so much i want wild magic seriously such a wonderful magical power i love daine s growth her character development i m so excited to reread the rest of the quartet 
7535,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,wild magic is a wonderful book by tamora pierce it takes place in the same world as the alanna quartet and you get to see some of the characters from that series but older you can read this one first if you want the main character of this book is very interesting and well developed i recommend it for those who love animals fantasy stories and interesting female protagonists 
7536,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,i ve read this book before but i always enjoy reading it again it if full of marvelous characters some characters are from other series and some are new i think the magic highlighted in this book is fascinating content some violence some innuendo
7537,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,it s been years since i ve read a tamora pierce book i forgot how awesome she is nice thing about older books is there s no waiting in between and i can read the rest immediately haven t read this series yet so i m excited to dive back into the world of tortall 
7538,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,the tamora pierce book that really started it all for me her best as far as i m concerned and what sparked my passion for fantasy literature and writing great plot amazing characters she blends animals and humans in the most realistic fasinating way 
7539,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,this will always be my quintessential fantasy novel my guidepost for a well told heart warming story i come back to this book at least once a month and if i don t learn something new about writing at every visit i always come away feeling a little lighter than i did before 
7540,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,num stars from the adult me but this would definitely be a num star book for the num year old me a time when i was reading animal stories and fantasy and wishing i could talk with animals ok i still wish that 
7541,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,i wish i had discovered tamora pierce as a child this seems like classic young fantasy i m so glad that the mc and her mentor aren t romantically involved i was really worried about that num year age difference rest assured y all 
7542,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,i enjoyed this book it was quick and engaging but daine wasn t as much of a trope breaking heroine as alanna was and she was a bit but just a bit of a mary sue i ve already got books num num from the library will be banging them out in short order p s baby dragon 
7543,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,absolutely wonderful tamora pierce has done it again i forget how many times i have read this book each time it is absolutely jaw dropping the characters the plot the magic oh what a wonderful tale so looking forward to reading the next one 
7544,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,3,so the girl who talks to animals makes loads of friends with various creatures and people and then does not make the animals get involved in human affairs if they don t want to be so good job another fun fantasy just like all of the tortall books i ve read so far 
7545,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,4,i loved these books when i was num num and they still have the ability to make me smile and love them num years later
7546,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,a comfortable friend

7552,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,j adore so epic and the beloved character appearances made me squeal 
7553,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,i loved it even more the second time around on audiobook 😍
7554,Wild Magic,Tamora Pierce,5,i honestly have no idea how many times i have read this book at this point i love it every time 
7555,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,originally reviewed at bookwraiths reviews a long time ago in a decade far far away i was a teenager not only that i was a fairly arrogant one who believed that he knew everything had seen everything worth seeing done everything worth doing and had read every fantasy series that mattered when admitting that i realize how immensely naive and prideful it all sounds – especially that last bit however at the time i felt my observation about fantasy were completely justified i mean 
7556,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,originally posted at fantasy literature there are some fantasy epics that all literature professors and most normal people would consider essential reading for any well educated person j r r tolkien c s lewis lewis carroll etc so yeah i read those a long time ago but beyond that there s not much fantasy literature that s essential reading so for a long time i didn t read any in my drive to be educated i stuck to the classics which are classic because they re great literature 
7557,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,i chose this book for one reason on the back cover there was a review which read patricia mckillip has done something extraordinary to write a trilogy comparable to tolkien i was sold obviously as a writer myself who is an heir to that honor ridden legacy laced return of the king obsessed writing culture i needed to know what a book looked like that could be compared to tolkien if for no other reason what i found floored me patricia mckillip is a masterful writer not so pro
7558,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5, weak story shallow world building and characters what on earth i would say exactly the opposite compared to most of the shallow sloppy fantasies that are being cranked out these days this trilogy is absolutely singular in terms of story world building and character development this is one i come back to it never disappoints it was written in the nums and while mckillip admits being influenced by tolkien she succeeds in creating a unique complex and meticulously layered w
7559,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,the trilogy gets more stars than the main character has on his face i was generous even though it has its flaws here is why the way mckillip s magic system works is so utterly unique that i dare not compare it to anything magic is the innate qualities of a thing you understand the thing completely and you are magically connected to it able to be it or to use it against others people are fooled by illusions that are simply the augmentation of a thing s natural qualities which the tricks
7560,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,2,i can t recommend this book much is made of the dreamlike quality of mckillip s prose but i found that this detracted from what could have otherwise been a memorable and different fantasy setting a large number of intriguing plot points are introduced and then never referred to again swept away in the preoccupation with the characterless protagonist as the reader you never gain any appreciation of his or anyone s motivation as the plot moves from one travelogue to another here are a few
7561,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,num these three novels were really formative for me i read them i think when i was ten i got this collection for my eleventh birthday and i d already read them all at least once num there s a betrayal at the end of the first novel that ruined me for all other fictional betrayals caesar ned stark kanyeshrug probably real life betrayals too whatever happens to me in the future it won t be as bad as what happened to ten year old me at the end of the riddle master of hed well maybe th
7562,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,as with other books i will slowly add here this is one i think the world of particularly this one and for its love story which moved me to the depths but i will mislead by that comment the love between two people i refer to is not romantic in the conventional sense there is one of those done and done well with a wonderful female character who is strong and practical in her own right i should not even have to say that should i but this other relationship takes the whole trilogy to relat
7563,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,good fantasy if somewhat a little predictable the writing however is pure poetry mckillip s mastery of the english language is downright breathtaking 
7564,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,i grabbed a copy of this book to read on a plane to ireland the plane landed when i had finished all but one chapter and i ran to the baggage claim to sit down and finish it the story was compelling the writing was exquisite and mckillip manages the nearly impossible in writing about emotions and experiences that are impossible to put into words she suggests them so well that the reader is able to feel them it made me choke up in a number of places even cry in a few and there are imag
7565,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,2,i picked this one up as part of my reading project for this year i m really trying to read more books written by ladies pre num in sff this definitely fit the bill but unfortunately it didn t grip me anywhere near as much as i had hoped for this includes the third and final book in the trilogy which follows morgon prince of hed and raederle his lady love i ve reviewed the first two individually from this one in this volume we see both of them come together after much adventuring abo
7566,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,when i picked up this book the only fantasy i had read for a long time were of the large serial variety robert jordan george r r martin i gotta say this was quite the breath of fresh air the characters are all likable the plot and pacing were perfect and even though this is only one book it s a trilogy but the size of it is about the size of one volume of a song of ice and fire so i think of it as one book the world is very immersive the sense of urgency as the hero of the story
7567,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,common mckillip themes exemplified by this trilogy num there is nothing which cannot be faced endured known understood num art conquers all misfortunes num the mind is the most powerful weapon num he who plays god had better be prepared to be god especially when god turns up and wants his housekeys back num mess with teenage girls and the shit will be on num stand by your man even if it means turning pirate to hunt the dead bastard down 
7568,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,1,i bought and read this book on the recommendation of several family members who had read the original books when they were first published and when they were much younger readers compared with the other fantasy novels that i ve read this is among my least favorite for the following reasons lack of background on the world lack of depth to the characters lack of conflict and plot poor dialog formatting the story was mildly interesting but has been done several times before and at this po
7569,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,2,while mckillip s prosaic writing is masterful it also makes the book very difficult to read i found myself screaming just get on with it while the most interesting characters were never fully developed the title character was overdeveloped and unlikeable i grew weary of the constant whining over his destiny remorse for things he did or expostulating on everything from life mysteries to romantic endeavors she wanted to create a tolkein like world but ended up with only the dismal sha
7570,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,so this is yer basic three part magical feudalism farmboy leaves home and finds a sword and a destiny tolkien clone kind of a thing with flat characters in a sometimes incoherent world but also a strong prose style and enough specific interest to earn it a place on the shelf with its samey siblings and a richness that s hard to identify it s pretty good what makes it fascinating is that it was written by a woman in the early to mid nineteen seventies it predates brooks and by decades eddin
7571,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,explicitly inspired by — but no slavish imitation of — the lord of the rings patricia mckillip’s trilogy is an epic fantasy that stands on its own merits rather than in comparison with tolkien’s work yes it starts with a very domestic scene before exploring from one end of a continent to the other and indeed  the main protagonist is reluctant to embark on his quest but in reality the whole feel and mood of mckillip’s narrative is far removed from tolkien’s not least because it gives almos
7573,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,stuff i read riddle master the complete trilogy by patricia a mckillip review i will admit to being a bit at a loss of what to say about this series on the one hand i liked a lot about it and liked the way it meandered about and came at a couple question in interesting ways on the other hand this book was a bit dense in places and i didn t really feel that it helped the narrative to circle back and back to certain things and there were parts where i just wanted to know what was happenin
7574,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,beautiful absolutely beautiful i started reading this book and found myself a little bored or seeing ways i thought it could have written it better but then suddenly i found myself swept up by the mastery of the simplicity and i was in love with the world and the characters and the plots the beauty is in the simplicity the sparseness that still somehow captivates you what this book does that so many modern books fail to do is that it gives you almost everything it gives you enough and th
7575,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,mckillip tells us right up front in her introduction that this trilogy is a inspired by tolkein and b neither her favorite nor her best writing she s quite correct on both counts telling the tale of a backwater prince a somewhat large fish in a tiny pond not entirely unlike certain hobbits discovering his true destiny and just how important he is to saving the land from an incomprehensible evil the structure is rather tolkeinesque sadly the best and worst of that work is stashed in here 
7576,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,this is my all time favorite series even though it is older than most it just brings me to tears every time i read it the hero is so likable so everyman that he is easy to identify with and raderle his love interest is so strong so independent the entire second book centers on her this is over thirty four years ago the trilogy makes use of a number of themes from celtic mythology the novels take place in a fantasy world divided into a number of countries each ruler has a mystical awar
7577,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,first i recommend that you read this compilation that contains all three books of the trilogy as you need to read them all and you need to read them all at once plus since i read it that way it was like reading one longer book which i prefer to three shorter books anyway i really enjoyed these books the writing is lovely almost poetic which for me is both good and bad good because of course beautiful writing is good but bad because sometimes my admiration of a particular passage w
7578,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,2,i m having a hard time getting into this book the quotes on the cover not withstanding someone should have edited these books it s a compilation of num novels i had a hard time following the dialogue in places because she doesn t always tell you whose talking and the characters behave in inexplicable ways if it doesn t get any better soon it ll be for sale on amazon finally finished the book which is a reprint of mckillip s first fantasy books it was hard to read more than num pages at a t
7579,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,1,it pains me to give a fantasy book zero stars because fantasy is one of my favourite genres and i usually find something to like in a fantasy book even if i didn t think it was that great but i can t remember liking anything about the riddle master i found the writing obscure and difficult to get into none of the characters were especially appealing and it seemed to me the plot just dragged on and on without going anywhere exciting i d give more details but i read this awhile ago and my only
7580,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,this is an omnibus edition containing all num novels in the series i would rate the first book the riddle master of hed a five num star book with the two following not quite up to its standard this is a great series

7584,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,really enjoyed this book i appreciated the section in the back of the book with all of the characters as there are a lot my one wish/complaint is the lack of first person narrative from raederle in the numrd book i wish we could learn more about her growth in magic i picked up this book in a search for fantasy novels with strong female characters which this book definitely had but there could have been more 
7585,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,long read but definitely worth it 
7586,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,2,good fantasy writing has to have some sense of reality to anchor it i love fantasy and i love being taken to the heights of imagination in a good story – so long as one foot remains firmly planted on the ground there has to be a connection to life as i know it in order for the fantasy to work and to hold my interest i doubt i’m alone in this riddle master a trilogy that is really one long book starts out with great promise within the first num pages i was caught i liked the characters i
7587,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,among her earliest works a classic of the genre among the first works of celtic fantasy telling a tale of a land where all the sovereigns have land law a mystic link and everyone knows that the high one is the master of all the land s land law and where riddles are bits of historic lore with reasons appended morgon of hed born with three mysterious stars on his forehead is at home with his brother eliard and sister tristan awaiting the merchants tristan describing what she wants sa
7588,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,by patricia mckillip i linked to a full sized cover for this one out of habit but believe me you don t want to click on it it is terrible terrible which is a pity because i really like this trilogy it s mckillip s for lack of a better term questy set lord of the rings crown of dalemark hero sets out on adventure unwittingly etc etc but mckillip works well with the conventions of her genre and ultimately i think that riddle of stars stands up as a representative of questy fant

7590,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,so much to say but i ll keep it simple patricia a mckillip s prose is beautiful she has a way of weaving images in and out of the plot the result being a thick comfy lush tapestry of world and story aspiring fantasy writers should read this trilogy simply to study the beauty of language and its possibilities the overarching plot is engaging but i hesitate to give the trilogy five stars because well the ending didn t really grab me the big revelations the moments of explanation whe
7591,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,it s like someone started with lloyd alexander s prydain expanded it threw in a pinch of cecilia dart thornton s something and then it echoes of lord of the rings and it reads for all the world like a kinuko craft painting it s told in a dreamlike legend like quality as if the author is a bard spinning the whole beautiful tale and not someone who expects you to live the story quite alongside the characters except where it drops fairly frequently into detail of startling beautiful r
7592,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,this was a nice adventure story filled with a lot of peace and sweetness in the characters personalities and relationships the romance was very clean it would be a great book for a young adult for me it was missing a bit of grit everyone was so trusting and cooperative even when the characters had some emotional outburst everyone was understanding and forgiving the villains were even made to seem sympathetic at least the end of the story acknowledged how trusting the entire world was an
7593,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,2,i first read this series in grade school i remember it as being some of the first fantasy i ever read and a favorite i picked it up again this summer after reading some other patricia mckillip stories i wish i hadn t it just doesn t hold up over time after reading j r r tolkien terry goodkind george r r martin and many other great fantasy writers the flaws are far too obvious to ignore it feels like a bad attempt at a first novel by a naive teenager there are words in here that do n
7594,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,another damn fat thick square fantasy trilogy with a map in the front and index of names in the back a flurry of strange names in the opening chapters it s hard to get oriented in this odd world lots of cryptic riddles few answers that i can understand honestly i found the book pretty obscure and aimless there s a sort of quest but our hero crosses the land north to south and east to west without much sense of a definite purpose great monomachies come to no definite conclusion the cha
7595,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,i really really wanted to love this book the author was highly recommended i loved alphabet of thorn and it sounded like it had a cool premise but the pace was so slow i didn’t have a lot of time to read and when i tried to sneak a little reading in before bed i would fall asleep within a few pages so this trilogy which really reads more like a really long book felt like it took forever to read it did have some cool ideas and some interesting plot developments in the last about num p
7596,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,still astonishing after so many years i first read this series some forty years ago and was simply stunned by it i was astonished by the author s vision the music and myth of her language the piercing beauty of the natural world seen through her eyes by the heights and depths of the mysteries she seems to discover everywhere her writing made me yearn ferociously for the magic of a wizard s eye a wizard s mind a wizard s heart and it still speaks to me with just as much power and passion
7597,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,2,i liked the first half or so of this trilogy very much mckillip s use of language is wonderful and richly detailed and i liked the way morgon in particular seems so young for the role he s forced to take uncertain at first in his choices i also liked the way his relationship with raederle comes across as a liking of individuals despite the trappings of prophecy and mythical matchmaking that surround it and the way she worked as a partner and an actor in her own right in the story but the
7598,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,i received a copy of this book as a christmas gift in num and i ll be honest didn t like it right away i had several false starts and trouble getting through the first chapter but once i got to about page num i was hooked and couldn t put it down i was also a bit put off by mckillip s introduction she almost seems to come down hard on the young idealistic author that she used to be and not give the book enough credit she says that she was inspired by the lord of the rings trilogy and want
7599,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4, the world is not a safe place for harpists i was well into the second section of the book before i realized that these were three separate books combined into one i liked having them all together in one place because the story needs all the parts to be complete this is a rich fantasy world and mckillip fleshes out the story and magic with skill even though at times the language seems a bit murky and sluggish i like our double protagonists morgon of hed and raederle i also like our
7600,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,this is such a dense trilogy with so many layers that hide beneath the quest narrative surface i found so much to wonder and marvel at such as morgon turning into a tree or the majestic purple eyed vesta i know that i will read this again there are so many subtle links that i am sure i did not see them all mckillip s writing is superb and she is a master of the genre i cannot wait to read more of her work and to re read this classic of fantasy i recommend this to anyone who loves quest d
7601,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,i ve read this trilogy in its separate books the originals from the nums many many times i bought this trilogy edition and read it and this time it didn t hold up as well as it has in the past i was slightly impatient with the books slow pacing particularly the last book and eager to finish it overall though this is an excellent trilogy for kids or adults who like fantasies with depth and intelligence the story is intriguing and the characters are interesting for some reason i can n
7602,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,this is the first book i read by patricia mckillip i was looking for a good fantasy author and she was touted as the best fantasy author you re probably not reading i was understandably curious i enjoyed the story of morgon the riddlemaster and prince of hed as he leaves his idyllic farmstead and embarks on a journey to fulfill a destiny already mapped out centuries before he was born morgon s internal conflict is highly engaging and i didn t hesitate to pick up book num in this series 
7603,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,2,i found the series in general underwhelming characters were fairly generic and indistinguishable and a lot of the book seems to be sandbagged by lengthy descriptions of nature while traveling from place to place in addition many of the so called riddles are not riddles at all but simply questions and plot elements to be resolved for example what happened to the main character who has vanished maybe there is some depth in the symbolism and diction that ghosted through my consciousnes
7604,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,you can ignore all the low star reviews on this trilogy if you look at the reading habits of those reviewers you ll discover several common elements to their opinion num they don t read much num they don t read much adult fantasy num they believe all fantasy after lord of the rings is plagiarized num they believe harry potter could have done a better job destroying the one ring solo walking uphill both ways in the snow surrounded by orcs i love people s opinions but read a few hundred books
7605,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5, he picked his way across the ceiling which lay in pieces on the floor the prose is kaleidoscopically beautiful like a hazy dream the magic system is utterly novel too e g using words and the true essence of a thing in order to have power over it lovely classic that not many know of at times it s like slipping into an old skin at others the sheer wonder leaves sparks in the mind s eye best of the tolkien clones or better put down your pitchforks people please 
7606,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,pretty unique as an idea it s not every day we see a man with nothing but his knowledge and riddles to overcome such obstacles the way morgon does usually the main heroes have some kind of supernatural powers and i kept guessing and un guessing is that even a word xd till the very end about many things concerning the story 
7607,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,a very different fantasy and very readable the world she developed has a unique culture the story line has a tempo that varies not all rush rush rush some fast paced some more moderate interesting take on heirs to kingdoms and quite a few twists turns and revelations that kept me enthralled also very re readable 
7608,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,i think this was the book that defined high fantasy for me so beautifully written and so delicately complex that i had to read it several times before i truly understood what had happened there s a hero a quest a harpist riddles true love it s epic but it s epic in a quiet sensual way that stayed with me for a long time after i read it mckillip s writing is for me near perfection 
7609,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,patricia mckillip is a master story teller she has a unique way of building a world that has depth and substance reading this book feels like you are getting a glimpse of a place with both a history and a future there is nothing flat or predictable about her writing the ending will surprise and touch you 
7610,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,this was a gift for my daughter this summer but i just had to reread it before the summer ended since this was my first week of classes i was a bit behind my goal but this book is like a wonderful gourmet meal the plot is so captivating the language so beautiful the imagery so powerful the experience so altering that it must be savoured instead of gulped what a timeless masterpiece 
7611,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,just finished another re read of this omnibus my three separate books version is rather fragile after so many time being read i have loved this story ever since i first found it back when it was new and am particularly delighted that there is a new essay by the author at the beginning talking about the intervening time etc 
7612,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,there are parts of this book that are really beautifully written and the first book in the trilogy is great and ends on a super cliffhanger but there is just something indefinable missing from it all that left me unsatisfied and made it hard to actually finish 
7613,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,my favourite set of books ever the greatest influence upon my life and my inspiration to become an author the books are fantasy with a fascinating world but above all the story is about love and hate and love despite betrayal 
7614,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,phenomenal fantasy unforgettable characters unforgettable world confusing in parts but that s probably just me quality time spent reading this gem definitely worth a re read i m sure i ll appreciate everything even more probably get the confusing parts too 
7615,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,still one of the most beautifully written books i ve read 
7616,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,another of those books i periodically re read twenty years later 
7617,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,classic fantasy that i have reread many times 
7618,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,one of my all time favorites 
7620,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,of all the words to describe the riddle master trilogy inheritor might be the most apt to begin with this book is a spiritual successor to tolkien in a way that very few fantasy series have ever managed mckillip places the emphasis of her conflict on adventure not action and the plot is undertaken by the unlikeliest and most pitiful of creatures in middle earth a hobbit in riddle master a pig farmer of hed mckillip is also preoccupied with riddles although she changes the rhythm to so
7621,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,as i finished each book of the trilogy i wrote down my thoughts the are as follows the riddle master of hed is the first book in patricia a mckillip s riddle of stars trilogy this is a magical wonderful novel mckillip s prose unfolds effortlessly a simple beautiful straightforward style of writing that nonetheless contains great power and depth like a strong current of water flowing beneath a gleaming sparkling river of ice mckillip s fantasy world unfolds organically her text is no
7622,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,one sentence keeps popping up when either someone speaks about fantasy or a author talks about how to write fantasy sense of wonder this assumes you are speaking in english of course but id even go so far that even if its another language they may use the english term sense of wonder sow since its just that useful in more modern fantasy this is partly thrown to the wayside and less poetic approach is taken more logic in both the world and the characters but usually you still want sow bu
7623,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,i read all three books in one volume so i didn’t make the clearest distinction between books i liked the series quite a bit though i didn’t think that it was the greatest display of storytelling talent i’ve ever read it seemed to me that patrick rothfuss has taken quite a bit from this story though naming shaping harping in wild lonely places asleep to oneself the wind being a powerful and central element there was a lot that made it feel like a less well written version of the kingkill
7624,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,at first this book seemed to follow the familiar path of country boy discovers he is the chosen one travels through all the lands of the realm to find answers and finally confronts the big bad guy i m not generally a fan of familiar paths but this one was beautifully written so i enjoyed it nonetheless then came the ending of the first book which put the whole thing on its head and soon i had no idea what to expect anymore i loved the twists and turns of the plot the complexity of som
7625,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,book num beautifully written with some pretty fun and engaging characters but where s the plot there s a plot for sure but it never really feels like it s going anywhere the descriptions are wonderful but the history and setting of the world are very confusing as we are never given any insight on their background history or purpose random names and terms are just thrown around without any explanation as to what they mean or why they re important despite some major flows it peaked my int
7626,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,this is actually three books a trilogy published together in one binding mckillip is an award winning fantasy author the back of the book blurbs comparisons to lord of the rings and in her introduction she makes clear that tolkien is the driving inspiration for her writing so i was excited to dig into this well it s interesting enough that i wanted to see it through but i can t really recommend it and anyone who compared this to lotr either never read those books never read these or is
7627,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,once in awhile there will be a magical book with sublime prose that transports you into another world for me it has happened with books like the fionavir tapistry by guy gavriel kay and now with the riddle master after finishing it i immediately went back to page one to try and reabsorb some of that magic it s hard to describe the writing yes it s lyrical and poetic but much more than that the words flow into each other every one in place and perfect there are no extraneous bits nor
7628,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,fantastic this was my introduction to patricia a mckillip and she did not disappoint beautiful writing beautiful story her prose is poetic there s depth woven throughout her words the words and sentences strung together are stories themselves it s one thing for a writer to craft a great story it s another for them to draw you closer with their use of language she made me wonder how her mind works how did this story come to be i mean piece by piece there s a lot of emotion in these wo
7629,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,going to review the three books in separate sections the riddle master of hed i initially really enjoyed this and it s my favourite out of the trilogy morgon learning to shapeshift in various ways was especially cool lack of female characters was annoying heir of sea and fire female povs were refreshing but i was frustrated by the whole story nonetheless revolved around morgon ok sure he s the chosen one but still raederle and lyra s agency felt diminished since they were just looking
7630,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,a few days ago i came across such a wonderfully caustic review of a book i had just read that i felt the need to check out what the writer of that review https //www goodreads com/user/show/num did enjoy patricia mckillip was high on the list so i picked one pretty much at random and read through it i m glad i did it was well written didn t allow the romance to ride away with the story and at least for the first two volumes had direction and push unfortunately the author seemed
7631,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,an incredibly beautifully devised series echoing welsh mythology and bringing in new myths of it s own if you weren t already a fan of her writing i would hope this would convert you there s an echo of joan aiken s harp of fishbones here the author lays out a country tied through land law to controlling rulers who invest power into their landheirs magicians are riddle masters puzzling through centuries of history to find answers to past devastation they only have scraps of details for an
7632,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,it s the classic fantasy story about a boy looking for the truth the forgotten history of the realm and his role in all of this i sometimes found it a bit difficult to read due to the writer s imaginative and descriptive way of writing but i think that might be because english is not my mother language i occasionly also struggled with the names of characters because they are very similar and confusing and often characters are brought back i have forgotten completely about but luckily the edi
7633,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,2,i liked the idea behind the book there was just something in the writing style that made it difficult for me to really get into the rhythm of storytelling sometimes it was an awkwardly used pronoun that caused character confusion other times a key action would be hidden at the end of a very long descriptive paragraph the descriptions were very good and the dialogue was well done i found myself more interested in some of the side characters than the main ones mathom har and the tree king
7634,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,my god a masterpiece the prose is perfect tentative probing exploring and enticing without revealing it s its own thing in a way disjointed and breathtaking in equal measure the characters are sublime filled with such rich nuance and complexity that they leap off the page they struggle as much against themselves as they do their destinies the world building is deep rich and built up slowly this is a complete gem and frankly i m mad i had never heard of it until now buy it 
7635,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,i am sure that i might give this book a better rating if i had read all three of the books in the trilogy first the place and character names come flying at you with abandon and many are never heard from again in this book perhaps they will be revisited in the next two nooks second the story is incomplete it would be better to set expectations that this is only the setup for the next book so the reader does not expect a complete story line 
7636,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,painfully beautiful prose i think there were some cliches some plot issues but the descriptions characters and settings were so varied and so very rich i really didn t care i got swept up in it i felt like i went on that journey with morgon i felt like all of those people and places existed this all happened somewhere some time long ago this story is told with such care and such compassion i can t imagine it ever not being a favorite 
7637,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,this is the kind of book that stays with you long after you ve finished reading it i find myself pondering questioning turning characters and plot points over in my mind looking at the storyline with fresh eyes this book will make for an interesting re read i think it s a riddle in itself though i am pleased that i called the major twist before it was revealed finishing riddle master is like stepping out of a dream it has a melancholy aftertaste but a good one 
7638,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,2,i got num books into this and put it down shortly after starting the third one the characters are more of official fantasy types than they are real people and every time they start to get a little real they double down on being a type i m sure this is a good example of a fantasy epic that follows the types but that kind of thing is not really my jam i can see why this series ended up out of print 
7639,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,definitely interesting reading a fantasy trilogy that i didn t know anything about at the end of it all i m not sure i know a ton more about it no seriously though these books were mysterious telling a story as though the reader knew quite a bit more about this world than we did that was intriguing and kept me reading learning along the way makes you work a bit and some of it is described more than explained but i liked it more than i disliked it 
7640,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,this series speaks to me i have read it three times each time i read it i am transported into a world of legends and runes the author has a unique style that makes her novels feel like legends this being one of her first works i cannot advocate for incredible writing but still i find myself reading it multiple times for some reason i find it beautiful 
7641,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,epic and amazing i read this when it first came out i was a teenager who discovered fantasy through ms mcwilliams realm as a lifelong fantasy reader i still rank this trilogy as one of the best most human stories i have ever read thank you for the many many times i have been completely absorbed in the epic story of a prince from hed 
7642,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,patricia a mckillip just makes such fun fantasy worlds where it all seems so real and alive there s a quality to her writing that is just whimsical and fairy tale like the riddle master trilogy is no exception there s a lot of mystery involved here as riddles may suggest and seeing how the characters deal with these mysteries is a joy totally recommend 
7643,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,2,i really didn t enjoy this series it seemed like it would be amazing but it really fell flat i couldn t really follow the story and a lot of things did not make sense 
7644,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,this book is beautiful harrowing tragic fantasy written by an author gifted in lyrical prose i get lost in her imagery lingering over the unique and magical images she invokes 
7645,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,1,it was hard to adhere to this book and there were no actual riddles 
7646,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,loved it glad i recently stumbled onto this author again fresh world fresh characters 
7647,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,excellent and strange
7648,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,it was an interesting trilogy but it was often confusing and the characters lacked clarity and definition i wanted to like it more than i did 
7649,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,morgon s epic journeys of a young prince in a strange land where wizards have long since vanished but where magic is waiting to be reborn 
7651,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,1,i didn’t even finish this book it was just too difficult to follow and i was bored 
7653,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,an interesting trilogy of a someone trying to find their place in the world wonderful imagery and a surprising conclusion makes for an engaging read 
7654,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,really enjoyed this tale and very memorable characters

7660,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,this book kept teasing me with unanswered riddles until the end 
7661,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,the riddle master trilogy is a wonderful fantastical series the world building is intricate and purposeful i highly recommend it to anyone that loves high fantasy the difficulty in this series lies in the first installment the riddle master of hed the story is highly condensed and i think suffers from pacing problems much of this most likely has to do with the time it was published num there wasn t much opportunity for the long fantasy volumes that are now commonplace the journey of
7662,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,oh riddle master i wanted you to be the best i ve ever read and you came so close but after reading the riddle master of hed and being in so so much awe with the astounding perfection of the story characters and of course mckillip s beautifully eloquent writing i did experience some disappointments reading the rest of the trilogy i would have given this five stars if it wasn t for the high expectations mckillip conjured within me and want to note that this rating is very personal and i
7663,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,this is the omnibus edition of the riddle master trilogy the riddle master of hed heir of sea and fire and harpist in the wind these books tell a story that on the surface might seem kind of cliched morgon prince of hed after recovering an old artifact in a riddle contest finds himself pursuing a mysterious destiny morgon travels across a realm where long vanished magic and ancient forces are re emerging and along the way he discovers many hidden things about the land and himself at t
7664,Riddle-Master,Patricia A.

7666,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,when i was in junior high i made my first book purchase the three books of patricia mckillip s riddle master trilogy i think i spent about num but that was a lot of money to a seventh grader who earned her pocket money babysitting at num/hour and doing chores at num cents each at the time i thought it must ve been a great purchase because i read the entire series seven times in a row that summer and continue to reread it occasionally over the years until the books fell apart i sketched my o

7668,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,it s not a matter of if patricia mckillip is all that fantasy should be or if she is tolkienesque or a fine story teller patricia mckillip should be compared to cormac mccarthy they write the same hinting dense lyrical prose the only difference is the subject matter i also appreciate patricia mckillip for bringing me forgiveness loyalty freedom acceptance bravery of mind the true themes of her books patricia mckillip s world creation is on par with star wars or hogwarts and he
7669,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,i waffle between num and num stars for this collection on the one hand it vacillates widely between being so fast paced the reader is in danger of dizzily missing important details and such intricately paced experiential world building details that the reader may get bored i love the characters and i love the world created for them but often felt myself lost and paddling sans oars to catch up patricia a mckillip is undoubtedly one of the most creative and unique fantasy writers out there eac

7671,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,finally after num long months i have finished this book now to be fair with myself and anyone else who happens upon this review i should have read these books separately and not as one giant book that was my first mistake my second mistake was putting this book aside for num months i should have just stuck with it and finished it out during the break i forgot who many of the characters were the places and the side story lines but that doesn t mean that num out of num stars is an undeserving
7672,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,this is the second book i ve read by patricia mckillip the other being the bards of bone plain which i thoroughly enjoyed this book or trilogy to be more accurate was very enjoyable but at times a little frustrating in that the plot could be a bit hard to follow it s a story about a riddle master who is trying to solve the most complex riddle of all his own identity answers come slowly and aren t fully revealed until the last few pages of the final book there are many parts of the
7673,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,riddle master is an avowedly tolkienian work it starts with the standard map of the realm it takes place in a vaguely medieval world of kings and farmers and wizards and such the hero comes from a quiet idyllic rural place set aside from the wider world of swords and sorcery the tropes of western folktales abound including the hero with a hidden destiny magical objects shape changers and of course lots of traveling on that map from page one this is an omnibus edition collecting the a
7674,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,patricia mckillip has been one of those authors who i could take or leave and usually left just because my to read list is so long i have the feeling that has changed over the course of the last week reading the riddle master the riddle master books num num trilogy was for me an excercise in reading at points for the first num pages or most of the riddle master of hed the riddle master book num i plowed through the book the pacing seemed slow the descriptions though amazing and inventive were n
7675,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,well that was odd i liked parts of it so much and other parts confused me the answer to the riddle at the end was amazing the plot planning in this book is astounding you might feel like giving up when you read it but don t it s so worth it 
7676,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,i read this trilogy every few years or so and find myself still amazed at mckillip s wit and imagination the trilogy is about a young farmer named morgon of hed the landmaster of a quiet nondescript island named hed landmastery is a hereditary talent given to the land s ruler wherein that ruler knows and in a very common sense is every inch and stone and plant and animal on his or her land morgon attends a university named caithnard where students and teachers study ancient storie
7677,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,a reader recently asked me for fantasy recommendations and as i stood in front of my book case my eyes fell on the riddlemaster trilogy by patricia mckillip together with the lord of the rings and the dragonriders of pern series these books were my introduction to fantasy and i’ve loved the genre ever since i originally bought the heir of sea and fire first the second book in the series simply because i was intrigued by the cover the scene where raederle the heroine bargains with one o
7678,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,patricia mckillip is one of my favourite authors not just because she writes a good story she also writes with lyricism and warmth her characters are believable and complex her story lines have surprised me and to be honest i m difficult to surprise there are only so many storylines in the fantasy genre and it s a rare writer who finds a new one patricia is a master at new and exciting storylines the land itself is a character in this set of books and each country has it s own rules and p
7679,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,there is something appealing in mckillip s depiction of a realm where princes brew beer and patch roofs a princess whiles away an afternoon with a pig herder and thousand year old kings seem no more socially elevated than a well to do uncle but this humility emphasizes that the world of riddle master is small at times the entire population seems to be no more than a few thousand but it may only be that mckillip wasn t really concerned with details of her world except to sketch a background
7680,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,this is a book that i read some time ago but have put off reviewing the reason is the idea that i may not be able to correctly capture the beauty and complexity of the storylines i do not have a background in literature and poetry to undergird my attempts to write a review here as i do a background in studying philosophy to help me write a review for some other books this book is that beautiful yes the storyline is hard to describe without giving away too many spoilers the main details
7681,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,patricia a mckillip grew stylistically more mature with her later fantasy novels but never i think has she done such a good job of portraying the delicate interplay of trust and doubt in a friendship the riddle master trilogy tells the story of morgon prince of hed land ruler of an island country of stubborn farmers true to his roots morgon wants nothing more than to remain at home with his younger brother and sister but when he meets the harpist of the high one the high one being the
7682,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,as this is the entire trilogy in one volume i ll comment on each book separately as i finish them num the riddle master of hed the beginning of our hero s quest to unravel the riddles that reveal the fate of the world and his true destiny all the while resisting the urge to just pack it all up and go home a lot of characters are introduced and it s a bit unclear just who will be important later however the back of the book compares the author to tolkien and i can see why her world is co
7683,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,first of all i d like to say that i think editors do great disservice to readers authors and books themselves by slapping good enough to be compared to tolkien on the back of them yeah it s a complicated plot with lots of ancillary characters yes it s an epic continent crossing journey it certainly has a similar mystical but not exactly magic feel to the special powers of several characters especially rulers and leaders and yeah it s a story about someone taking on a huge destiny t
7684,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,it s hard to know where to begin with this one the world is a place where rulers have something called the land rule which seems like a kind of psychic power but is more like a bone deep knowledge of their land and the living things on it morgon the main character of the first book holds the land rule of hed a quiet and peaceful island where farmers farm and most of the ruling he does involves helping to fix people s roofs as you might expect the book starts off a little slow but it q
7685,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,this series has a slow start but gradually lures you in give it a little time most of mckillip s writing is jewel like with lovely imagery there s a surprising amount of humor in her books as well it just leans towards subtlety edit num/num/num i ve been re reading this in bits and pieces here and there and finally finished tonight it is still num stars and still beautiful it s my go to escape book and now i want to jump back in and buy the rest of mckillip s books i loved the idea of t
7686,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,the first book the riddle master of hed belongs to the title character morgon of hed riddle master and farmer prince who finds the most challenging riddle of all is his own identity and destiny the next book is the story of raederlie morgon s love who in heir of sea and fire goes in search of him and finds out much about her own identity and powers in harpist of the wind both work to find out what has happened to the high one the sustainer of the land law of the realm that ties the ru
7687,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,i had problems with this book but at no point did i feel like giving up on it and it s really three and a half stars if only for the writing my first problem was riddles and shape shifters two things i usually dislike but it turned out that riddles only meant requesting knowledge and shape shifting wasn t corny werewolves so these were not problems at all what bothered me was motivation i couldn t understand why characters behaved as they did i know that in some magic systems knowing s
7688,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,2,i have to agree with those who gave this book an average to poor rating i liked the book as a child but upon re reading it found it ridiculously flawed largely for the reasons already stated in other peoples reviews none of the characters draw you in or make you really care and the story is garbled and unconvincing it is a shame to write this as i really enjoyed the book when i first read it for me though it is a case of what could have been some of the ideas in the book are really gr
7689,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,it s easy to understand why this is considered one of the fantasy classics patricia mckillip weaves an epic story of lyrical beauty with high stakes passionate characters such vivid scenes and so much emotion i believe some of the images will live forever in my mind absolutely recommended an aside i guess every sf book builds on top of other stories but i find it an special treat to see where an author might have gone oh that s not how i d done it the riddle master trilogy really feel
7690,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,i wasn t a huge fan of fantasy but i got the riddle master of hed from the library and read it that day went back to the library in the afternoon to get heir of sea and fire and got harpist in the wind the next day then i bought the single volume edition though i think i d rather have the individual books the ending when morgon and raederle walk back from the beach to their house is beautifully simple the perfect ending to a book of byzantine complexity in which riddles are piled upo
7691,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,this is simply a beautiful book the writing is beautiful poetic but purposeful the plot is beautiful simple but layered enough to warrant re reading the characters are beautiful neither heroes nor mundane and straightforward but with layers of complexity the worldbuilding is beautiful it never really gets in the way of the story and while the world is fairly small it carries a sense of wholeness it s a little more concrete than many of mckillip s other books which tend to get d
7692,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,this book moved me immensely patricia mckillip uses language beautifully and deliberately and her love for her characters and the world she s created come through very clearly i can t help but fall in love with her characters too and root for the same characters she s obviously rooting for my heart broke a little at the end of this trilogy and i cried through the last few chapters i think i ll need to take a few days to recover from the shock of it before i start reading something new i
7693,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,vote num num class l anum fp the riddle master trilogy well from the beginning to almost the end i was often torn between putting it down or hoping it would get better and it didn t get better it s a good fantasy series but i was almost never caught by it and it s certainly not in the same league of the great classics of the high fantasy the world num num is a fantasy world well built but it lacks normality when more than half the people we meet are several centuries at least old or are
7694,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,i bought and read most of this collection in num and then stopped reading near the end because i felt like it was getting repetitive and the story was slow to wrap up after reading mckillip s latest the bards of bone plain this month though the similar themes made me want to pick it up again it s still over long especially that last book and wanders a bit but the fantasy land and the system of magic she created are great and so is the supporting cast of characters a lot of things abo
7695,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,i enjoyed this the second time around a second time based on a friend s recommendation a kind of lord of the rings lite i ve never [yet] come across a similar underlying purpose/ability as used in this trilogy the first time i read it i began this story with high hopes—its introduction mentioned the author’s influence by tolkien mckillip has an interesting premise that really needs to be better developed even though she spent num years creating this trilogy she needs to spend a few more y
7696,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,mckillip is an amazing author the story may start a little slow with a small mystery but with each attack each nugget of additional information the story builds each book in the trilogy ends with a mind blowing revelation that makes you wonder how she will top it i had guesses but no way did i guess the final climax i had to go back and think to see how it all fit together incredible how she fit it all together it does get rather dark toward the end seeing as there s a major war and
7697,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,this book is confusing nobody ever has a whole conversation that makes any sense i don t like to be patronized by a book but jeez eta as i get farther into it now about num/num through i am finding it more understandable i do find that i keep forgetting names though and then a character will pop back up and i ll go crap i know i m supposed to know who that is i really like some parts of this though i m glad i stuck with it so far eta i just finished this book wow i m so glad i stu
7698,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,i admire patricia mckillip s dialogue style in this trilogy it s somber cerebral and quiet note that i didn t say the narration mckillip doesn t sound like ernest hemingway i have studied it even because as an aspiring novelist i would like my characters to sound somewhat like mckillip s if possible and if appropriate i think the riddle master trilogy is stronger in characterization than in plot there was always a quality of limited detail about the events the antagonists mckillip 
7699,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,this was one of the books on the original list that stephen gave me when we first got together and it started a lifelong love affair with mckillip s fiction oddly i hadn t returned to it since that first read num years ago and when looking for something to read out loud we grabbed this one off the shelf it s a compendium of the three original books in the series which i would recommend for anyone to get all three are less than num pages the first two books are incredible but the first half
7700,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,i had high hopes for this book i must say it didn t let me down but it also wasn t at the level i expected the world is very good some characters are awesome like raederle dadan or the wolf king but the main character wasn t in my view up to the task sometimes you ll end up not feeling for the character or finding strange that all others give him so much importance without any real motive to sum it up he simply lacks charisma since this book is a trilogy if i had to rate it i would giv
7701,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,1,i did it i finished it well i sort of did it i read the first third the riddle master of hed though i almost abandoned it literally num pages from the end because the single edition trilogy didn t give any physical clues as to when it was over and god knows the story didn t it was not pacey the main character spends the book travelling across the land repeating a brief proscribed conversation that s all about him and never once asking anyone else how their day was the conversati
7702,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,this is one of those books that once you finished it you don t want to start a new book at least not right away i found myself going back to one of the first scenes in part one after i finished seeing suddenly details fall into place that i could never have understood when i first read it the author wrote this trilogy after she read the lord of the rings when it was new she wanted to write something as good as that i like riddle master much better than lord of the rings even suspecting t
7703,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,for me this book feels like a mix between wizard of earthsea tales of the dying earth and songmaster the story is set in a world of name magic but instead of the usual power over the thing you name you also get empathy with what you name this small change has implications that flow throughout the book perhaps the part i liked best was the simple idea that the nobility had this name power over all from within their realm this forces these people to be more kind and practical than what
7704,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,i had never heard of this book before i saw it on some internet list of books with crazy cover art which is unfortunate because this is probably one of the best fantasy trilogies out there the world of the high one should be put up there with middle earth pern earthsea and other classic fantasy lands as an equal mckillip is a fine writer and although the story may have started slow once i caught on i was captured by the story of one man s quest to find out who he is sure the tropes ar
7705,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,it s funny because the first time i read this book i thought it was really mediocre i reread it recently and changed my mind i tend to be a speed reader and figured out that does not work well with this book there are a lot of details that if you skip them over tend to make the book confusing and hard to understand ordinarily i can still get enough of the gist to keep reading but in this case it really cut down on my enjoyment so this time i forced myself to slow down and go back if it g
7706,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,this trilogy is as all mckillip fantastic epic and brilliant and so beautifully written and full of unique and fascinating characters fabulous i love it etc i have read this several times and of course every time it is new as i can never remember exactly what happens after this latest reading i do have a few questions/issues spoiler alert num raederle is described so many times as having vast power and then she does nothing with it she almost fizzles she does occasionally pu
7707,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,poetic masterful fantasy riddle master is an omnibus collection of mckillip s wondrous riddle master trilogy the riddle master of hed heir to sea and fire and harpist in the wind and is an absolute must read for lovers of fantasy who enjoy works of whimsy poetry and the absolute fantastic as opposed to the grand formulaic schemes of epic fantasy don t get me wrong riddle master is epic but there are no galloping heroes storming armies or political intrigues the common sort anyw
7708,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,many people seem to miss connecting with this book and i could have been one it s dreamlike rhythms are so different than the fantasy i am used to reading slower and in soft focus i didn t succumb to its charms until i slowed myself down once i did though mckillip s prose is so assured it is never ostentatious but suffused with small charms always just the right exchange between characters or the poignant image or the unassuming but perfect turn of phrase so much of the story is bu
7709,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,2,lots of interesting ideas but i abandoned the trilogy after the second book it just didn t click for me the pacing seemed awkward and i never connected with or quite understood the characters motivations or why their relationships would suddenly be so close there also seemed to be a lack of continuity characters that i liked in passing would return and i wouldn t even recognize them at first i felt that the story moved and deepened much too quickly without an adequate grounding by th
7710,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,one of my all time favorites truly a classic in every sense of the word mckillip s writing is very rich and she hits many many high notes with this trilogy it starts a bit slow with a seemingly well trod provincial lad on his way to being a hero path but please don t be dismayed because these book s are truly unique the magic system is beyond awesome and the changes in the characters that come with this power and the greater understanding of it are masterfully rendered the story swells a
7711,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,this is a horribly complicated review to write i m not even sure how many stars to give it at some level i m not even sure why i keep re reading it i still remember finishing the riddle master of hed for the first time and having a deep hatred of the end but i still re read the trilogy view spoiler [morgan and raederle are such wonderful characters and all the lands and land rulers are so beautifully drawn that i like this book very much at the same time i read it to remind myself th
7712,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,i enjoyed the first two thirds of this book where the characters and world seemed more real that is to say the fantasy or magical elements seemed somewhat grounded in reality i especially thought the land law/land rule concept was interesting and epitomized what i like it was extraordinary but just so not over the top it could be real it didn t seem silly just an extra layer on normal reality that made sense and added depth however by the end of the second book where the main love int
7713,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,2,i was equally disappointed and infuriated by riddle master the characterisation was thin and there were no credible motivations for most of the characters the protagonist was tiresomely whiney in the first novel of the trilogy there were gaping chasms in the world building where key terms and concepts were left unexplained and not even for a clear narrative purpose the plot twists were obvious and heavily telegraphed all of the people in positions of authority turned out to be benevolent a
7714,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,the writing is top notch as i had come to expect from this author filled with astounding poetic prose and unconventional ways to describe sights and sounds the story also has intense philosophical underpinnings borrowing plenty from the usual fantasy fanfare but also expanding them in depths in ways unrecognizable from the bland tomes that populate shelves there are so many good things to be said about the quality of the book but i still prefer the author s single volumes stories as i fee
7715,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,i agree with most of my friends in book club so far who read this book it was worth the read in the end i think it would be a good book to re read sometime since it would have a very different meaning reading it the second time i would understand so much more and thus probably be able to pick up on things that i totally skipped over in my brain because of being lost the author does a great job of getting you totally confused and in just enough time before you decide to toss the book foreve
7716,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,i read these books num num years ago at the recommendation of my fantasy loving brother i remember really liking them but especially remember that one of them ends on a crazy cliffhanger it was late at night when i reached the end and didn t have the next book and i was freaking out i went out and bought it the next day and when i complained to my sister in law about it she replied tell me about it try reading it and having to wait a year for the next book to come out i agreed that my num
7717,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,the riddle master of hed is the first fantasy book i ever read i happened to see it on the school library shelf in numth grade and it s what got me interested in the genre i am such a fairy tale fan and who can resist fantasy as the ultimate fairy tale these books must be read together to complete the story so having them all together in one book is very helpful as the first book ends on a cliff hanger that you don t get back to until the third book it might make you a little crazy to wad
7718,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,patricia a mckillip riddle master omnibus the riddle master of hed heir of sea and fire harpist in the wind i love an omnibus and it s great that these num books are still in print written num num num if you have not read any mckillip you have missed something that is beautiful to the point of being breathtaking her prose in gorgeous her language is rich with simile and metaphor her writing is an all you can each buffet of stunning imagery possibly nearly more than you can ea
7719,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,book one starts off with a bang and you are plunged into a world of names and places find the map and the index you will need them this volume is an entertaining and bracing traditional pilgrimage of a prince seeking knowledge book two is a change a gathering of women unfortunately the gathering seems rather pointless searching for the prince and so we learn that the princess is also searching for knowledge book three is deeply spiritual and very little of it is the physical battle so ma
7720,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,i have loved this series of num books ever since i read it many years ago and i still keep rereading it mckillip is so skilled in character development that i love to go back and meet these people again and again even the villains are fascinating as are minor characters like morgon s sister the plot kept me guessing the first time what is the significance of the num stars and what is morgon s destiny who are the earth masters and what role have they played and will they play in the land the
7721,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,i first read this when i was about num i got caught up in the adventure and magic i re read it a few years later the adventure was still wonderful and i appreciated the characters around morgan were believable i read it when i was felt stuck between what everyone expected me to do and what i knew i could do the reality of the world and the politics came in to focus more i read it for inspiration because the language mckillip uses has always created strong beautiful images for me i read it a
7722,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,i don t remember the first time i read this trilogy probably when i was num or num just as i was seriously getting into fantasy looking frantically for something like the lord of the rings riddle master filled that void nicely and has been one of my favorite trilogies since then it is definitely am older style of fantasy than what is common today not nearly as gritty though it is dark and grim at points and its not solely focused on action although it too is there just a beautiful
7723,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,this book was a lot of fun it was very similar to tolkien i really enjoy this type of fantasy world epic journey good vs evil sorta stuff this does not disappoint if you like the same lots of different lands to explore people to encounter creatures to learn about magic to delight in witchcraft wizardy and shape changing and riddles to ponder the thing that set this apart from other epic fantasies is the riddle component you never quite know who to trust and who has what role in
7724,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,early fantasy from one of my new favorite authors this trilogy though is more straightforward fantasy than the ethreal complex tales she weaves later a land of many kingdoms is guarded/ruled by a god some think is no longer there the wizards were wiped out ages ago by an evil wizard and riddle masters are the scholars on the samll island kingdom of hed the oldest of three orphaned children heirs to the leadership takes a dare on an age old riddle in order to obtain a crown and this s
7725,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,i really wanted to like this book more than i did i think the idea of land law and inheritance is excellent i like the riddle aspect and the magic i like the way the author revealed information slowly and how she had lots of legends and back story but i just felt like it didn t quiet have enough explanation there were too many magical or mystical moments where things are revealed in the character s mind and you are not quite sure what happened and it is never spelled out also i thought the
7726,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,this was the first book i ever read by mckillip and i just fell in love with it and her writing she has a literary style that is just beautiful to read and sparks the imagination this story is unique and amazing deth is one of my favorite all time characters that i have ever read he is deep mysterious and beautiful morgan is a wonderful hero with few of the normal hero qualities i enjoyed him a great deal and found myself caring for him as well she does an excellent job at unraveling o
7727,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,while this book does have a few flaws it is one of my favorite books in any genre you have to read the entire thing to get the full effect of it s meaning it s like taking a swim in the open ocean you might feel lost sometimes but you feel like you ve experienced something worth the effort because it teaches you things that you can t learn in any other way that said it was still an enjoyable read there is humor romance mystery and something deeper that you can t quite put your finger
7728,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4, my book was missing num pages after page num instead of the pages that were supposed to be there pages num to num were repeated i missed a few important revelations never mind what i had speculated would happen happened i wanted to read about it i liked the book the prose is spare but evocative i liked most of the characters though quite a few of the minor ones were a bit two dimensional the pacing moved at a sedate pace without making the story boring and the system of magic intr
7729,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,i bought this book for num cents at a library book sale when i was in grade school it now has been duct taped back together from so much use and year after year i find myself cracking it open for yet another re read the writing style isn t particularly nuanced and the character names are hilariously hard to pronounce and yet this series is perhaps one of the best examples of excellent storytelling i have ever read even after the numth read it keeps changing shape revealing a new aspect or
7730,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,i had to ill the second and third book of the trilogy so i m guessing this series isn t so popular i enjoyed it but can see how others might not sometimes the writing seems too unedited but i love the big ideas it hit me the way ursula k leguin s did when i first read it the importance of naming the deep connection of the people to their place and the importance of solving riddles the characters were so compelling i guess i just wish they had been more developed and i had more time wit
7731,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,book one the riddle master of hed num stars book two heir of sea and fire num stars book three harpist in the wind num stars i absolutely adore these characters the setting is gorgeous and mckillips prose is always breathtaking i loved the outcome of the story and the way she brings it about however sometimes the poetry of the writing overtakes the story and i am left feeling like quite a moron when i can not for the life of me figure out what is going on lucky for me i catch up at som
7732,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,one of my all time favorite fantasy series the prose is elegant the story is deeply layered intricate filled with wild beauty and resonant with echoes of a distant tragic past morgon is an engaging hero who grows beyond imagining and raederle is a strong smart independent and thoroughly feminine heroine i first discovered the riddle master trilogy when i was in high school in the late nums and several years ago was thrilled to discover all three books in this beautiful all in one ed
7733,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,i first read these three books in high school and adored them i still have the copies i bought then over twenty years ago and i re read them periodically in many ways i see them still as being as rich in detail and in the veracity of the built world as tolkein s middle earth in one way i like them more than lotr the main character of the second book is female betrothed to the main character of the first book this is the perfect set up for the third book in which they work together to ful
7734,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,beautiful story i ve read lots of mckillip s later works but for some reason this original masterpiece of her has been evading me even though i ve had the book in my shelf for couple of years mckillip has created an intriguing world with riddles land law harpists and the elusive high one mckillip says she was inspired by tolkien s work yet there is very little of tolkien in this story it is epic in scale and has interesting twists and turns for a story that s about fate written in sta
7735,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,mckillip begins to show her predilection for protagonists that num got schooling that everyone in their day to day life thinks is high falutin and useless num just want to have a quiet mundane sort of life with lots of time to read books num peculiar destiny type things happen to them despite points num num the prose still has some clumsy points which reveal themselves if you try to speak the text instead of quietly reading it but dang this is the set up for all of her puzzle box stor
7736,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,before starting this series i didn t realize that it was written in num that would explain a lot of the book and probably would have made it more enjoyable i didn t pay as much attention to it as i should have perhaps then i would have liked it even more the first book was somewhat interesting what with the undead coming alive three stars for the first book but the second book tapered off and my attention wandered two stars the last book redeemed the whole series i couldn t put it d
7737,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,this may be my all time favorite fantasy trilogy and i ve been reading fantasy in bucket fulls for oh num years it s beautifully written gorgeous lyrical imagery gorgeous characters who you wish you were friends with mysteries gathering slowly like clinging ghosts all stemming from the riddle of those three stars it s answer revealed at the very end and utterly wonderful and utterly satisfying i enjoy it every time i re read and i ve re read these dozens of times this in fact is how
7738,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,out of all the thousands of books i ve read this is my utter favorite why so it s subtle it s magical the story line is intricate and nuanced our hero faces his fears and eventually understands them without everything being explained there s a backstory which is only hinted at and which becomes an integral part of the story itself every two or three years i pick up this old favorite from the bookshelf and read this with great joy i remember things i ve forgotten and once again thrill at
7739,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,2,back and forth over the world doing high fantasy i love mckillip s writing and remembered fondly reading the first book of this trilogy but on retreading the books i have no idea how i endured it there isn t really a plot to speak of just the hero rushing from place to place on the latest urgent and driven magical mission often in animal form pausing occasionally to try to make his girlfriend go home for her own good she refuses mckillip has polished her game since thank goodness 
7740,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,2,i really enjoyed the first book it had real and enjoyable characters unfortunately from the second book the story just became more abstract and the characters less vivid various powers are thrown around for no real reason and nobody has any idea of what to do it seems to amble around from place to place forever until finally it runs out of words there s some lovely images and writing in there buried beneath the travelling but it s a rather boring read of random mysticism after the first
7741,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,one of my favorite fantasy authors jacqueline carey recommended this series so i thought i might give it a try i immediatly fell in love with the writing style it s very lyrical enchanting mysterious it was a pure joy discovering this magical world and its rules i would also recommend it because it features a strong and powerful woman in a lead role which is something i always appreciate in a fantasy novel in fact raederle is a wonderful character maybe this is why i enjoyed the se
7742,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,my son had the first volume of this trilogy on his shelf i read it and had to keep going mckillip has created a complex world where riddle masters maintain all the history logic and philosophy in the form of riddles the characters are interesting and so numerous that the trilogy has a num page list of people and places at the end the story line while endlessly unexpected is often hard to puzzle out if i read it again and i may i would keep track of the riddles posed in the first volume 
7743,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,i originally read this book back in high school or maybe even earlier and find myself thinking about it sometimes so i re read it one of the things that stuck with me then is that i didn t get all of it and there was still some of that in this go around the book is obtuse but then that is part of patricia mckillip s draw that she writes differently that her stories are not the typical one of the most beautiful things about this book is how it describes emotion that is the heart of t
7744,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,this was a re read after many many years i don t think i liked it as much as i did when it first came out probably because it isn t as polished as her later works and i ve been spoiled by a lot of good fantasy writing since then even the author admits this is a book she wouldn t write today and she can barely recognize herself in the person she was back then mckillips turn of phrase and writing style is beautiful however and i must remark upon how original the storyline was in its day 
7745,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,2,this book frustrated me it had plenty of epic moments plot twists and reveals but what i missed was the character development or plot build up to make me care another gripe was with the logic of many of the decisions that were made there didn t seem to be much sense to what the characters did finally the magic and prophecy in the book were never explained most books will at least give you a framework of how magic works in their universe but after reading the trilogy i don t know how the
7746,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,the paragraphs are long and rambly and often the gem is buried somewhere in the middle of them but the story over the three books is well told these forehead markings preceed a lighting bolt and are just as dramatic and engaging if not more so i first read this in numth grade courtesy of my brother in law i enjoyed the nuances of emotion and twists of story more as an adult i wasn t expecting happily ever after around every corner like i did at fourteen a good imaginative story not am
7747,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,this was a re read for me third time actually but i think this was the first time i really understood what was happening mckillip has a beautiful and lyrical style of writing but at times it can obscure her meaning in the tradition of epic fantasy i maintain this trilogy is one of the best she manages to bring a new twists to familiar tropes so that there s some level of comfort in the trajectory of the story but never so much that you can predict what will happen next also raederle i
7748,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,this series is one of my all time favorites although a little confusing at first the series is full of complex clues that all point to a surprise ending it is one of those rare books that only gets better with a second and third read through although i have read others by this author the riddle master trilogy is clearly the best by far a must read for fantasy lover s 
7749,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,i first read this trilogy in my teens when it was a new paperback trilogy in the local public library i later acquired a hardcover copy of it through the science fiction book club and spent the next two three decades wearing it out with re reads until it fell apart and then finally purchased this edition of it when it was re released i d have to rate patricia mckillip as one of my all time favourite authors even her older writings like this trilogy are well worth a re read and her newer
7750,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,overall i liked it however while the language she uses to write is poetic and beautiful sometimes it was hard to get past it to read the story also there are quite a few instances where the character realizes something but the reader doesn t get in on the joke which is odd because we get to see inside the character s mind a lot the second book was from a different perspective so that threw me off and the third one had some chapters very akin to battle scenes that i tend to skim al
7751,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,i have read these books a number of times over the years and have retained the deep love i had the first time i read them many years ago i adore the hero morgon the prince of hed and was enraptured by his world and the earth magic that was so much part of it i liked his fiancée/lover raderle she was a strong able woman in her own right and didn t so much journey alongside morgon as have her own journey which finally met up with his i loved the world building the details the characters th
7752,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,this is probably one of only a handful of longer works that i ve read more than twice now this delightful story is compelling on many levels the pacing is outstanding the characters have depth and you care about them the mystery is slowly built up and revealed at an appropriate pace and has a great deal of emotional depth that one might not suspect at first if any title in my library deserves the moniker of a good read this is certainly one of a handful that whole heartedly earns such r
7753,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,1,this book was just to dull to finish well i seriously tried to hang on but must surrender at page num something my own fault btw the blurb on the backcover should ve warned me in advance it s a rare thing that patricia mckillip has done to write a fantasy trilogy good enough to be compared to tolkien a reader s guilde to fantasy so if you had the same strugling as me to drag yourself through to the end of the lord of the rings then be warned don t start on this trilogy otherwise 
7754,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,creative well written fantasy triology about quests magic saving your land fantastical adventures etc all the good stuff a great fantasy novel should have i heisitate to recommend this to readers too young but perhaps middle school readers who have a love of fantasy and are strong readers would be suited to this otherwise i probably wouldn t tackle it til at least high school also mckillip is a talented author and has written many fantasy novels that are worth reading this one is
7755,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,this book was a pretty good read sometimes i found the writing and descriptions of what has happening to be a little vague and confusing but i think this was intentional the author seemed to be trying to i think copy is a little strong here but imitate tolkein s style a little too much i ll have to read some other books by mckillip to find out if that s really her style or not the cover says this was a trilogy but it didn t feel like three separate books at all more like just thr
7756,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,1,i read a couple of mckilip s more recent novels and enjoyed them so i decided to try this one after reading the reviews here i have only read a few chapters and found it very tedious to read the narrative is shallow and often confusing the characters are unmemorable it may probably get better at some point but i can t read through a few more chapters of boredom i do think mckilip is a good author and her writing has certainly developed into a more sophisticated style from her later bo
7757,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,4,this book has all three books in the trilogy i found the first book frustrating because mckillip did not adequately explain who everyone was by the second book though there seemed to be more focus on the main characters and books num and num really focused on the love between morgon of hed and raederle of an their search for themselves and to save their realm i liked that mckillip left the reader the lattitude to think for themselves 
7758,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,3,this is a overly ambitious attempt at epic fantasy from a then inexperienced author mckillip is a master at weaving tightly constructed fairy tales but that skill isn t on display here if you are already a fan of mckillip there is some lovely writing here but i would strongly recommend new readers start with some of her other work i love this author but was disappointed with riddle master 
7759,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,2,i don t know why i read this and kept reading it sometimes the writing was pretty describing nature and magic in lush prose yet nothing swept me into the world mckillip was trying to build the story seemed both flat and forced and i didn t understand why events that she deemed important were important i guess the only reason i kept turning the pages was that it was my bedtime read and the minimal interest i had in the outcome helped lull me to sleep 
7760,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,superb fantasy following the king of a small island in his quest to answer the riddle behind a name that has been given to him this book is all three novels in one the first concentrates on morgon of hed book num brings other characters to the fore and the third wraps everything up neatly characters are really well drawn the writing just seems to flow and plenty to keep you reading through the night 
7761,Riddle-Master,Patricia A. McKillip,5,i read this once when i was a lot younger and this story has always been in the back of my mind i read it again just recently so it was with more mature eyes that i was finally able to appreciate what made this trilogy so enduringly bewitching the plot is very complex as are the characters the main of which is one of the few dynamic characters in the literary sense that exist in modern literature

7763,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,it s amazing that i ve never found time to read this book before i have seen the movie but it was years ago and i only really remember the one thing that everyone remembers the real strength of this book is that is just ticks every box imaginable it s a fairy tale full of action romance and revenge and it has that timeless quality that the best fairy tales seem to carry it was published in the nums but it feels like it should be a thousand years old passed down from generation to genera

7768,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,i am one of the few people in the world who does not think the book is better than the movie here there is an undercurrent of bitterness in this book that i find off putting i am given to understand by a friend that those elements i e the autobiographical stuff in goldman s own persona are actually fictional but i found that they soured my enjoyment of the story they framed i couldn t enjoy the writing of a writer who seemed as misanthropic and hateful as goldman came off to me tpb is s

7773,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,2,i know there are people who looooooove the film the princess bride while i thoroughly enjoy the movie i think i may only loove it i mean inigo montoya is fabulous and i really really dug westley and the pwiest was vewwy vewwy funny so when someone was kind enough to lend me the book i had relatively high expectations now don t get me wrong i wasn t disappointed in the princess bride but i just wasn t thrilled or moved to laugh till i cry which the movie sometimes can first of
7774,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,i m a little biased when it comes to this book yes i saw the movie first and it made me happier than anything i ve ever seen before or since yes i do consider how much a person likes the princess bride before determining how good a friend to be with them i don t insist on it but it can queer a good friendship i m not alone in this but i do share a similar affinity for the book despite discrepancies that may make others blanche and even for me fezzik will always be a frenchman and not a
7775,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,i feel the need to gush i ve set aside the many books i want to read for the moment in favor of rereading this one i loved it when i read it way back in about the sixth grade so i thought it was time i give it another shot as much as i loved it as a kid i love it more now maybe because i can appreciate it on different levels i m only about halfway through on my reread but i ve come to the conclusion that goldman is a genius the story characters and dialogue are impressive enough but t
7776,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,long before the movie existed i stumbled across this book in my college bookstore this cover spoke to my ya fairy tale loving heart so i bought it without knowing a thing about the story and the book was not what i was expecting it was way way better if you love the movie read the book and don t let yourself get bogged down in the long offbeat intro skim it if you need to you ll get a lot of background history on the various characters which can be extremely funny and a little
7777,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,this book was so fun i actually believed it s an abridged book goldman totally got me i liked the way he wrote this book the silly humor the amazing characters the wonderful story everything was so damn entertaining 
7778,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,i consider the princess bride as one of my all time favorite films i think i was about num when i first saw the movie and a score or more later the love of buttercup and wesley still brings warmth to my heart besides this how could i forget inigo montoya mandy patinkin immortalized this character with his delivery of the famous line my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die sigh i think the book is almost as good rarely do i favor the movie version over a book b

7781,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,i didn t even know what the princess bride was until last year and i wouldn t know what it is if it weren t for this popular meme oops sorry wrong meme that s more like it now what was i saying hello this is sensible vane interrupting ramblish vane she tends to talk a lot without getting to the point so i decided a quick intervention would do good what she was going to do was to tell you a very detailed story of how she came to know the book she was supposed to review and then she would
7782,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,2,dnf at num how do you even begin to review a much loved classic when you didn’t even manage to finish it i tried i really tried to like this book but no it just wouldn’t happen to think this is kate daniels’ favourite book to think the beast lord himself tells her “as you wish” at the end of magic burns why oh why couldn’t i like this book oh well i guess it can’t be helped so let’s start from the beginning i had a problem with this particular edition from the very first pages first
7783,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,1,i absolutely loved the silent gondoliers it was just a perfect gem in every way num stars was not enough reward for it s brilliance with that in mind i was hyped to read the princess bride and not ready at all for the experience when i lived in jerusalem i used to leave the snowy heights in winter for the perpetual summer of the dead sea the lowest place on earth about an hour away swimming was impossible the water buoyed you up rejected you even so that body parts were impossible to keep
7784,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,what a charming read this is one of the few books where i saw the movie first then read the book i think william goldman s book was largely unknown until the movie came out like shawshank redepmtion and stand by me based on the novella the body this is one of the most accurate book to screen apdaptations it is almost verbatium from the book and the few variations zoo of death rather than pit of despair have no real impact on the story being as i edit fantasy visa vie my husband s books
7785,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,my first read of num starting off the year with a num star book when i first finished reading this i wasn t sure whether i should give it num or num stars while i was reading it i was absolutely in love with it but once i finished it and thought about it a bit i noticed a few problems with the story the main problem i had was with buttercup she was the most beautiful woman in the world but she didn t have any other nice qualities she wasn t kind brave smart funny or talented she was actua

7787,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,this book has its moments but i m not sure what all the fuss is about it s all very clever and playful and a little bit silly but for all the originality in the telling it really doesn t end up anywhere worth going i did enjoy it on the whole but i found my mind straying quite a bit thanks to a lot of device and not enough story said device being the premise that the story is an abridgment of a very old classic with the abridger insinuating himself into the story to tell you about th
7788,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,rating clarification num num stars i want to start by saying that i loooove the movie i dont even know how many times i have seen it already i liked the book too very much just not as much i guess that over the years the movie has reached epic territory in my mind the princess bride is beautiful and funny i think that all the exaggerations and classic fantasy elements of this book are brilliant mostly because of the way they are mocked and the way they work perfectly to create such an amazin
7789,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,i m probably spoiled because i have seen the movie version of the princess bride about a gazillion times as i read i just pictured robin wright cary elwes mandy patikin et al as the characters i even heard their voices in the dialog that said the princess bride is a brilliantly executed concept it s really a novel within a novel as goldman tells a fiction story about his relationship with s morgenstern s the princess bride and his path to abridging it so it only has the good pa
7790,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,i can t believe i thought morgenstern was real not for long really but still when i discovered he wasn t i hated this book for a while but then i reread it and it was awesome in an entirely new way i m still not a huge fan of the fake little tidbits that the abridgment offers especially the allusions to florin as a real place but i generally just skip over those also i find the story of goldman and his fat kid vaguely depressing and i didn t like the part about westley wearing jeans

7795,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,the book was good but i think the movie is better they are very close to each other but i think the movie cleaned it up quite a bit 
7796,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,i love this book i think when people read fantasy books they always think of the classic tropes a princess that needs saving a humble farm boy training to marry the girl of his dreams a son who lost his father an outcast who wants a family a jerk prince they have been done and done again however the princes bride gives those tropes a twist what i love about this book is that the twist isn t some kind of satirical statement of society it might be but that s not the whole point butter
7797,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,this is one book where i enjoyed the movie better the way it was written was difficult for me to keep interested the book dragged in parts and i skimmed through some of it it seemed to take forever to get to the end i wish their were not so many long interruptions and the extra long introduction to him and his credentials i just wanted the story which was very entertaining num num stars

7802,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,from the onset i knew this would be for me a battle between pbtm and pbtb princess bride the movie princess bride the book and in the beginning it was about halfway through though i forgot about making comparisons until this review at least and just began to enjoy the tale goldman is a master storyteller and even his asides keep you interested in the progression of the story now if you think you re going to sit down with this lovely little book and read the enchanting and th
7804,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,this book in its entirety would not have gotten num stars however i m just judging the actual story of the princess bride not all of goldman s weird intros and ramblings about trying to get his abridgment going next time i read the book i ll be sure to skip those parts which were quite boring and became tedious i love the whole story of buttercup and westley inigo and fezzik and their crazy adventures i also love the movie 
7805,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,when i was a little kid i hated this book and its film adaptation but i think i was just too young to fully understand it reading it again recently i ve really come to love it with its imaginative story vivid vocabulary scenery described so realistically you can envision it in your mind and a vibrant loveable cast of characters and reading it also got me to purchase an old copy of william goldman s magic a book that has become a favorite of mine as well the princess bride is a little d

7807,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,i have been a member of this site since january num i know i am feeling pretty old these days and the very first book i put on my to read list you guessed it was this one so roughly five years later i have finally read it so what is this book about well it depends who you ask it’s about a tale of high adventure and true love it’s about a girl named buttercup and a farm boy named westley it’s about a spanish fencer named inigo montoya and a giant named fezzik it’s about a blood thirs
7808,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,this book was so exciting i loved the movie having watched it only very recently and was surprised and happy to learn that there was a book version so i bought the book and started reading and had the very strong sense of deja vu the book and the movie are so similar of course there are things in the book that do not take place in the movie but they are equally thrilling and wonderful i was glad to be reading a story that i almost instantly fell in love with and get an in depth perspecti
7809,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,num stars yet again another book that wasn t as good as i was anticipating it to be now don t get me wrong this is a magnificent piece of literature that everyone should read however it lacked in many areas too many in fact that i couldn t give it anything higher than four stars the beginning was great i m not going to say it was just okay or anything like that because quite honestly the beginning was the best part it kept me hooked until westley left and then everything seemed to
7810,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,continuing my loved the movie so let s try the book escapades i am shocked to write that this book is every bit as awesome as the movie it s it s wait for it inconceivable i love the movie and was initially concerned that the book would be a let down but then i saw a whole host of rave reviews and figured it would be safe to dive in it was not only safe but as much fun as i could possibly have hoped for it s just just here it comes again inconceivable how good this is now there
7811,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,it’s classic fantasy fiction started like “this is my favorite book in the entire world though i have never read it ” what s morgenstern s classic tale of true love and high adventure plot goes like powerful prince arranges a marriage of convenience to the most beautiful girl in the world but love is not required again what once it took tempo story ran like river ohh damsel in distress only kidnappers with damsel forced through river hills swamps and savior hero face decision

7813,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,what an exceptionally random read i can see how this became a cult classic it s smart witty has a great cast of memorable characters and is the perfect example of metafiction at its finest was i the only one who thought goldman’s ‘introduction’ was real and there was actually a guy called morgenstern it was only when the author started calling his wife unfeeling and his son morbidly obese that i realised i better do a quick google and clear things up because surely no one would insult the
7814,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,you probably already know this is a pretty delightful book well it s an even better audiobook read by rob reiner and if you know who he is you can hear him narrating this in your head already so once upon a time my grandmother was staying with us for awhile it may have been after my grandparents divorced and before she returned to nebraska to help her aging mother but i don t remember for sure all i know is that my zz that s what we called her was living with us and i got to see her n

7817,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,i can t believe i d never read this book before i grew up watching the movie and i love it but for some reason i d never thought about there even being a book i have to say after reading it it s now one of my favorites here s a book that has everything a beautiful up and coming princess a swoon worthy bad ass swashbuckling pirate who believes in and is willing to fight for true love a giant an honor bound spaniard with the single most awesome catch phrase ever r o u ss the list go
7818,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,fencing fighting torture poison true love hate revenge giants hunters bad men good men beautifulest ladies snakes spiders pain death brave men cowardly men strongest men chases escapes lies truths passion miracles it has all of that i wasn’t too keen on the torture a bit of an understatement but this is the most absurd adventure story ever and i loved it 
7819,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5, num num num num num num feeling blue need a pick me up read this book this is one of the ever so rare instances where i say the book and movie are both equally amazing the movie was perfectly cast directed and acted and this book had excellent writing wit and character development i loved every page of this book 
7820,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,probably my favorite fairy tale well except snow white so much humor so much affection dastardly deeds are trumped by the courageous and rhyming whenever you speak is actually really hard 
7821,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,the abridgment notes were slightly distracting in a way they were not in the movie but this book was still marvelous and if someone doesn t write buttercup s baby i m gonna lose my shit no joke 
7822,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,it’s incredibly hard for me to write a review for this book because i had such high expectations for it at the same time though it was entertaining and had everything it promised high action revenge miracles and most importantly true love i can t pinpoint exactly what it was that bothered me what kept from loving it at first i thought maybe it was the fact that the main characters didn t always seem to do the noble and honorable thing sometimes i questioned if westley and buttercup re
7823,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,i am in a swashbuckling mood these days and it is all westley s fault after recently reading as you wish inconceivable tales from the making of the princess bride written by cary elwes i had to re read the princess bride for the umpty eleventh time and i loved it as usual but i can clearly not let this review go by without saying that while the princess bride is supposed to be an abridgment of the s morgenstern classic of the same name the screenplay for the movie is an abridgment of thi
7824,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,i enjoyed the movie better but both of these have a lot of cheese xd tip don t waste your time reading the guy s thoughts in between the story it s so pointless and full of mild swearing i m off to annoy my friends by quoting this num/num 
7826,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,1,now william goldman has written the screenplay of one of my favorite movies butch cassidy and the sundance kid and i really enjoyed princess bride the movie i have a friend or two who have recommended the book to me and told me that it is so much better than the movie sadly the only reason i finished this book… was that i kept hoping it would eventually get better i’m sorry to all of you who might be a fan of the book but i thought that it was absolutely idiotic the movie is pretty well k
7827,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,i think i have seen the movie too many times to be able to come to the book with anything like a fair perspective to be clear this was on the agenda of almost every movie party i went to or held in high school i cannot count the number of times i ve watched it it s up there with monty python and the holy grail for movies of which i can recite long sections without pause unfair as it may be the movie version is my version of this story and i was not unbiased coming to this book note the r
7828,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,i have wavered back and forth on my feelings about this book but have come to realize the princess bride is a modern storytelling classic just as william goldman states on the cover of his numth anniversary edition it is a tale of true love and high adventure pirates princesses giants miracles fencing and a frightening assortment of wild beasts it is also silly at times frustrating but definitely an original after i got into it which i admit took me num pages i couldn t help but
7829,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,1,am i really the only one who hates this book i d be lying through my teeth if i told you that i read all of it i had about num pages left and decided to just watch the movie to find out what actually happens like i care i didn t like the characters especially buttercup i didn t like plot but i will say that i liked how william goldman told the story don t listen to my review and not read the book because apparently num of my friends gave it num stars num gave it num and num gave it num i think th
7830,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,although i ve seen rob reiner s excellent film version of the princess bride many times i ve never read the original novel until now goldman s writing is sharp amusing his cracking dialogue shows what a great screen writer he is there are times when the story drags a little but it s still a really fun read however when i tell you that i prefer the film to the book i know exactly what you ll say inconceivable 
7831,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,well i really wanted to adore this book and while it was super good and nearly five stars i had to knock a few stars for various reasons the good buttercup and westley so wonderful i ll admit i was a terrible bookworm and i watched the book first but i had no clue the book or the movie existed until i watched the movie so fair fair i ve noticed that most people have watched the movie and haven t read the book a lot of people don t even know there is a book so if you don t know
7833,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,hilarious characters and a story that will stay with you forever i have seen the film of the princess bride too many times to count so i can t believe it has taken me this long to get around to reading the book this is a story within a story william goldman s grandfather used to read the tale of the princess bride by s morgenstern to him as a child now an adult he decides to reread it and discovers the tale to be a lot more long winded than he recalls he realises that as his grandfath
7834,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,i m gonna be honest here i don t get why the film is such a cult it s kind of meh and i don t get why the book has practically achieved modern classic status either because it s good very good but the world is full of very good books but here s the important part i sank completely into the classic adventure tale atmosphere and fell for most of the characters i laughed my ass off and am most probably going to reread this quite soon i loved it basically buttercup s baby frustrated me
7835,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,i inhaled this in one sitting love love love love that s all i have to say 
7836,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,choppy but i suspect it was meant as such considering it was written as mostly a screenplay and edited by a writer if you can call him that who had no concern whatsoever in preserving the sanctity of the original author s intent a cut here a slash there s morgenstern s classic tale is ripped to pieces under william goldman s butchering knife he justifies it by the fact that he leaves a few chapters untouched yet can t help but interject his unwanted thoughts upon his poor unsuspecting
7837,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,buddy read with annette athena cathryn and michael initial thoughts what a glorious book i loved every second of it the intros were fun the story amazing the excerpt at the end fantastic and a taste of the sequel even better i will attempt a short review some time in the near future just know i loved it and this is definitely a must read actual rating num num stars no spoilers review what to say about this book wow what a story so many giggles smiles tears angs
7838,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,it s sacrilegious i suppose but i liked the movie better than the book hey it s a classic besides the movie was crafted by william goldman who wrote the novel similar to the film the conceit of this novel is that it s a book within a book never one to know when to end a joke william goldman goes so far as to write a forward to the princess bride s morgenstern s classic tale of true love and high adventure the good parts version there is also an excerpt from a fake sequel just
7839,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,i enjoyed reading this but probably not as much as if i d read it without seeing the movie first even though it was some years ago i liked the satirical take on the swashbuckling man in black the master swordsman inigo the strong man fezzik the evil prince humperdink and the beautiful bride buttercup and the adventures that ensued there are some wonderful inventions the cliffs of innsanity the zoo of death and the resurrection pill i also enjoyed goldman s device of pretending to abrid
7840,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,i will forever and always love both this novel and the movie also i blame westley for every unrealistic expectation i have for men and romance because this this man drools 
7841,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,this is a book where i enjoyed the first half and then it fell flat for me i truly think the movie cleaned up a lot of the messy disjointed flow of this book the dialogue and wry observations were my favorite parts of the book yet overall i know i won t ever reread this it became more of an effort to finish it than to read it which is so odd for me because i raced through the first half and enjoyed it 
7842,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,the princess bride will never show up on any pulitzer or booker list but if it s high adventure romance and laughs you re after the search ends here i just whipped through this one and it was one of the most fun easy reads i ve had in a while indulge yourself this is a perfect beach novel with a unique approach by the author 
7844,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,i have never laughed so hard at a book as i laughed at this one so many jokes i didn t understand when i was younger 
7847,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,holy wow that’s it… i am now and forever team goldman i want to have this man’s baby okay… he’s like num and i’m fixed but i would totally untie my tubes for this man num year olds can still have children right how old was jerry lewis … quick google that okay some num year old sired a kid we’ve got time i fell hard during the introduction to the numth edition… and i do not read introductions… what’s the point it was true love during the introduction to the numth anniversary and i was clear
7848,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,1,i did not like this book it was extremely discrimintaing in my opinion and i don t think it teaches good values to people who read it it made me just mad especially because it bashed a who i am b what i want to become and what i love it was very just wrong how discriminating he was against women he made sure we all understood just how stupid women are and that they can t do anything themselves also according to him we re all unloyal backstabing prats who are flippant and immature
7850,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,num | i m so glad that i decided to pick this book up as i ve said before the princess bride is one of my all time favorite movies so i was excited to see the comparison between the book and the movie i feel as if the movie followed the book quite closely which was kind of surprising to me there were a few things left out but all in all the movie did a fantastic job of keeping the plot and the humor from the book one of my favorite things about the book was william goldman s writing and com
7851,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,if you only know the princess bride from the film turn off your computer immediately and find a copy of the book the film is a thing unto itself and enchanting on its own terms but because it s a movie goldman had to redesign his novel in a way that de emphasized one of its most compelling themes why books matter what we learn from them about life and about being human and why certain books stay with us in the way that they do why in fact we are all on this website most of this takes
7852,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,i m kind of torn on what to rate it so for now let s say num num i enjoyed this a lot more than i expected to once i got into the story it was fun though i never really cared for the interlude/author parts or the introduction i get what william goldman was trying to do but i just wanted the actual story rather than his dry and jarring interruptions the characters and dialogue were great and it s very quotable and witty but it was only really the halfway point that i really got into it and li
7854,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,the princess bride is one of my all time favorite films and the book is an utter delight to read hilarious quick paced and un put downable the film is as faithful a representation of the book as there has ever been william goldman wrote both so you ll replay the film in your head as you read but it s fun to see where the two stories differ ever so slightly prince humperdink was one of the most changed characters and is much more of a threat in the novel goldman is clearly having so mu
7855,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,the princess bride just like the movie but with extraneous stuff i assume everybody knows and loves the princess bride film by rob reiner one of my favorite fantasy films back in num when i was in numth grade i fondly recall fred savage sick in bed with crusty old peter falk as his grandfather reading the story to him as well as the hilarious group of inept kidnappers vizzini wallace shawn fezzik andre the giant and inigo montoya mandy patinkin who i was shocked to realize plays the
7856,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,loved it 
7857,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,the princess bride i will say right away i’m a huge fan of the movie but this fact almost kept me from reading the book at all i’m a fearful reader at times i’m afraid to reread a beloved book and have my opinion change i’m afraid to read a book if i really loved the movie for fear i will see the movie differently i’m afraid to read the neverending story and find out what bastian’s mother’s name is because all of my life i’ve tried to figure out what on earth that kid has been screaming out
7858,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,i hate to say this but this book almost only got num stars from me nothing to do with the story concept that i still love but i hate how the author butchered it to start the first num plus pages in nothing but an introduction and the authors first chapter which has to cover how he got into the story how he liked sports how he became an author and movie writer blah blah blah chapter one should not be your autobiography so num some odd pages later i get to the bottom line mr goldman di
7860,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,read this in high school and it s still one of my ultimate faves 
7861,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,not as funny as i thought it was going to be slightly disappointed still a good read 
7865,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,num num one tip before you read the book don t read the introductions seriously just don t i was stupid enough to read the numth and numth anniversary introductions and i regret it that s like num pages of stuff most of us already know i mean honestly most people know about the debacle with the morgenstern estate so you don t really have to read it the only introduction i suggest is the original one that came with the book it ll explain all you need to know it may sound stupid not to but if
7866,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,warning any forthcoming review is resultant from necessary tidying of read and as of yet not reviewed books basically this is every bit as good as the film i suspect that the brilliance of the film may have altered some perspectives of this as a work of fiction but the book was the original and the film basically sticks identically to the book i know the fact that the title includes both princess and bride may also have discouraged some potential readers however it s a trap the book fo
7867,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,i remember seeing the princess bride the movie years ago and think that s all i didn t found it as hilarious as many people thought the movie is outdated sometimes silly and not good silly and again not masterpiece hilarious i read the book this year and aha now i get it now i get all the jokes all the pun all the satire of it with respect to the film the book is num times better than the movie and it s maddening that if you typed the princess bride in google all you wi
7868,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,the princess bride became one of my favorite movies when i rewatched it as an adult as a kid i kind of hated it but i wasn’t aware it was based on a book until i saw it at the bookshop obviously i didn’t think twice before grabbing it and despite my high expectations in the book it didn’t disappointed me at all the story flows in fact i read it only in two sittings and in the second one i refused to let my eyes close until i was finished this is a very enjoyable novel both for kids
7869,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,what can i say that has not already been said it is inconceivable that i would be able to lavish it with more praise than it deserves truly this book is a masterpiece of satire an adventure filled with lovable characters a story within a story done to perfection and because of this hot fairy tale from the nums the world was gifted with one of the best movies of the nums nay one of the best movies period amazing if you like great writing and laughter then you must read this and
7871,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,let me make it clear from the start that s morgenstern is a fictitious character created by william goldman i was confused about that at first because goldman the narrator acts as if morgenstern were real in this numth anniversary edition of the book he even details his hassel from being sued by the morgenstern estate so i just had to check it out i would give the original version of this book the num one four stars because it has just one introduction and the story of the princess brid
7873,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,num/num one of my favorite books numf all time and i m so pleased to see i still rank it so highly goldman uses such brilliant brilliant devices to tell this story such that i ve never seen before not only does he assume the identify of the morgenstern pseudonym to create dynamics within the storytelling but he also creates an entirely fictitious autobiographical account and frequently peppers the bride storyline with those personal accounts adding contemporary humor alongside the traditional
7875,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4, from a comment i wrote about this book to a friend not an actual review i felt like both the book and the movie were great but different i loved the story inside story of the book goldman writes it in such an excellent way that at a point you re no longer sure if everything is fiction i mean i knew such a book couldn t really exist but the way he wrote it made me hesitate and wonder maybe it did maybe it is real which i think is where the greatness of this story lies besides the
7876,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,read by rob reiner who brought the book and movie to a modern audience in a class of its own highly recommended 
7877,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,the princess bride is yet another one of those classic books that “everybody” has read but that i have just now read for the first time i don’t think i’ve seen the movie either although it’s possible i saw it when i was very young and just don’t remember it a few of the lines in the book were familiar but that may just be because i’ve heard people quote from the movie over the years i really enjoyed this although i think maybe a little oddly i enjoyed the framing story the best i did enjo
7878,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,conceivably the best swashbuckling action fantasy adventure love story ever abridged boy does it have it all apart from the boring bits which william goldman has expertly cut possibly using only his left hand inconceivably despite his insistence there is an original longer version including the boring bits by an author named s morgenstern this too is part of the fiction which makes it a dastardly clever book as well as highly entertaining 
7881,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,listening to as you wish inconceivable tales from the making of the princess bride made me want to read the book again my relationship with it is long and complicated when i was in eighth grade i spent a lot of time in the theater department my drama teacher had a little bookshelf in his office and one of the books was this battered old paperback copy of the princess bride i used to pick it up now and then and read the introduction just the introduction something about goldman s frame stor
7882,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,2,“life isn t fair it s just fairer than death that s all ” i want a real abridged version this book tested my patience i loathed the author butting in all the time it was just awful now i am not saying this book is awful it has its merits and gripping moments but never will i read this book again without a pen in hand to cross out all goldman or morgenstern has to say about it i mean what is this the author goldman tells the history of his fictional self who reads a book by fiction
7883,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,i must confess that my memory of the movie and the book have blended into one the best way i can think of to described my feelings about this story is warm affection and good humour there are lines of dialogue from this story that have become a part of our family language and quotes sneak into our speech at unexpected times you are warned nothing is ever unthinkable or improbable but it is inconceivable all the time vizzini he didn t fall inconceivable inigo montoya you keep using tha
7884,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,i didn t set a high expectation for this book as i ve never even heard of william goldman let alone read any of his works before however upon finishing the princess bride i felt glad that i did buy it as i think that it would be such a shame to miss a story as good as this if you read this book solely for the true love concept that is supposed to be one of the themes of the book you ll probably be quite dissappointed i m not saying that there s no romance at all in there true there is a
7885,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,written january num num oh my god i just realized that goldman was fucking with me the whole time and i was a gullible little num year old throughout this entire novel how could you deceive me like that goldman num there is no s morgenstern no mrs morgenstern no beautiful shrink wife helen no son but rather two daughters and an entirely different woman what i learned this after searching for the original book by morgenstern am i a gullible idiot or was i justified in thinking
7887,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,num num out of num my boyfriend made me watch this movie a few years ago telling me it was awesome and one of his favourites i kind of doubted him because i thought he only loved it because he had watched it when he was young i would be watching it for the first time at eighteen and thought some of the childlike whimsy would be lost on me i was wrong i loved the movie i have watched it many times since then i quote it on the regular it s a great movie i knew it had been a book first but i had
7888,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,1,i can t honestly put into words how much of a disappointment this turned out to be the princess bride is easily my favourite film of all time i actually know all the lines to it i was expecting to love this as much as i do the film this book is soooo infuriating it takes about num pages of unnecessary explanations to actually get into the story that is num pages of boring talk about a boring author and his boring life that in the end has almost no contribute to the story and could have been
7890,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,this review will be filled with confessions the first one is that the first time i read this book about num years ago i really thought it was recounting actual events in the author s life i thought there was an s morganstern and a place called guilder and florin at least i hoped there was i grew up watching the movie and when i realized that the film was based on a book i knew that i had to read it i ve come back to it a couple of time since then and it never disapoints me i confess thoug
7891,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,the princess bride is obviously a great classic tale so i wasn’t sure what to expect reading the book when i’ve seen the movie many times what i found was that i was basically watching the movie in my head as scenes and lines were often identical the excellent witty dialogues that are so memorable are undeniably the best parts of the book and i enjoyed them very much as the movie was reeling in my head i found the parts that were left out of the movie boring and i ended up skimming those a
7892,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,i ve always been an advocate of reading the book first but when the movie came out in num i was six and had no idea it was based on a book and shame on my dad for not finding it and reading it to me i loved the movie and my familiarity with it having watched it dozens of times did not dampen my love for the book one bit the movie is one of the most faithful adaptations of a book i have ever read most of it is lifted directly from the book which is wonderful and i wish could be said
7893,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4, the princess bride is about a multitude of characters that include buttercup the princess bride who is the most beautiful woman in the world westley the farm boy who becomes the most heroic man in the world inigo the spaniard who seeks revenge and fizzik the gentle giant there is a lot of different things in the plot and some of which are true love fencing fighting revenge torture passion and a lot more that i can t name after watching a brief snippet of the movie i was intere

7895,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,★★★★★ the book is a tad darker and deeper than the movie but so much fun high adventure and true love in a timeless fantasy would have loved if the numth anniversary special insights and forward could have been three pages longer so i could have used it in the “chuckster” challenge num pages however it was great to do it as a “buddy read” – thanks ladies ☺
7897,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,1,i wouldn’t be surprised if devout fans of this book and movie hiss at my unfavorable review of the princess bride s morgenstern’s classic tale of true love and high adventure by william goldman i just can’t do it i bought this book long before i’d seen the movie but after i’d seen the movie and disliked it i didn’t have high hopes for enjoying this book my friends and some acquaintances could not believe i’d escaped the nums without having seen this movie i don’t know what to tell th
7898,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,well that was different i ve seen the movie version but only once and probably about num years ago lots of it i remember lots of it not so much reading this i took a while to catch onto the fact that this author also wrote the movie screenplay and there is no s morgenstern or original classic tale that has been abridged once i caught on it added an extra dimension to my reading enjoyment sort of like being in on an inside joke the wacky jewish humor the impossible cliche ridden turns
7899,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,yep i finally read it and just like the movie i loved it but it lost a star because i didn t care for the part before the story started and after it ended i swear that makes sense i didn t like buttercup s baby at the end quite torturous for me to read but other than that i loved it ps while i was reading this i also read the graphic novel andre the giant closer to heaven really enjoyed it 
7901,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,this was a lot of fun it was short full of action very well narrated i ve never read the original feel no need i ve never managed to see the entire movie no need or desire but my daughter others babble about it all the time now i get some of the jokes 
7902,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,i grew up watching this movie and absolutely love it i thought it was about time to read it i am not sure if i am biased towards the movie but i did find myself wishing i was watching the movie instead of reading the book loved learning a little more about the characters and the story line i still liked the book but love the movie
7903,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,sorry everybody i know i m a disappointment it s not that i can t see why people are in love with this book i might have been myself if i d read it when i was num and if i hadn t already read pratchett who does similar things but much better and a bunch of other authors whose prose style and humour goldman is unsuccesfully aping or if i d seen the film as a child and was projecting the film s colour and liveliness onto the novel unfortunately i m not num and i d sort of like things lik
7904,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,confession time the princess bride everyone has seen it everyone who loved the movie has read it right right not quite you see i may have to turn in my geek card for admitting this but i m just going to come clean i ve seen approximately half of the movie and i didn t even know there was a book and to be honest when i found out there was a book i never planned to read it i don t even know why i decided to pick it up now i just had a random urge to read it so i went with it a
7905,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,definitely a fun story but it s incredibly dated and i don t really like how buttercup is treated witty and smart and engaging otherwise 
7906,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,num num stars this book deserves some attention i found it so hilarious i cannot understand why i did not read it before the book combines elements of comedy adventure fantasy romantic love romance and fairy tale and is presented as an abridgment or the good parts version of a longer work by s morgenstern apparently goldman presented it as a gift to his son after remembering the huge importance it had in his own life ever since his father read it to him at his sickbed but his son did n
7907,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,2,i didn t like this book the introduction in which the author describes the publication of the book and how it garnered interest enough to become a film was extremely grating to my nerves i couldn t stand the author s voice and by the time i realised that what i was reading was in fact an introduction to the book i had lost interest and didn t bother reading further for a few months i have since returned to the book and went to the first chapter without bothering to read the ridiculous introdu
7910,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,it s a great book gives a lot of fun back story to the already awesome characters you met in the movie i would highly recommend watching the movie first and then reading the book william goldman goes into detail in the numth anniversary printing of how he had a few actors in mind for a long time before the movie was made specifically andre the giant goldman also makes it clear that the other actors where all great choices too goldman also does a great job of blending reality with fiction 
7911,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,1,short version i abhor this book if i had read it before the movie came out i never would have bought a ticket long version let me tell you why with apologies to d p roberts seriously how can i be the only person who didn t love this book i adore the film so expected to at least like the book but the clever dialogue delivered by the talented actors in the movie with such vim and dread piratey vigor did not come across on the page for me and the interminable author asides fabricated
7912,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,contrary to normal trends the movie was much better than the book i know goldman thought his interruptions and asides were funny but really i found them boring and they slowed the book down the movie without these parts was much better the actual novel itself is your fairly typical fairytale romance though a tad more violent and pretty sexist in some of the actions and comments all in all there was nothing really new to the story and i d say if you ve seen the movie don t bother with the boo
7913,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,i enjoyed this book but it was a little overhyped i liked the concept of it in theory but the parts where goldman goes on about his publishing troubles i was ready to keel over from boredom it would probably have been a better book without the added layer of him pretend abridging a nonexisting book because the fairytale portion of it would have definitely gotten a higher rating from me it was predictable but funny and most of the characters fezzik num just so loveable i wanted a better

7916,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,this is such a fun creative book this is one of those rare instances where i loved both the book and the movie equally because they work so well as the medium they are and of course the story has it all romance adventure bad guys twists and turns did i mention romance so good 
7917,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,everyone everyone knows the movie version and it s a classic turns out it s a masterful adaptation of an equally classic short novel goldman is a hilarious clever dark writer it is everything you saw in the film with a smattering of hilarious description and background loved it 
7918,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,ha ha ha i love this story i can watch the movie over and over it never gets old for me this was my first time listening to the audio book version and it was almost as good as the movie

7923,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,one of the best books i have ever read truly a classic 
7925,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,i wanted so badly to like this book more than i did i mean the princess bride is supposed to have everything – pirates giants swashbuckling romance yadda yadda the movie is great and indeed the book does have its moments – a whole stretch of them to be honest unfortunately that stretch was broken up by william goldman s insufferable interruptions i mean sure it s a clever conceit that goldman has discovered and abridged a classic florinese adventure tale but the point of abridgem
7926,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,i loved this such a fun satirical fairy tale this is meta as helllll it s about goldman s quest to abridge the famous fake book the princess bride by the famous but fake author s morgenstern followed by his abridgement of the book to include just the good parts the parts of this book from a fictionalized version of goldman at least i hope it s fictionalized were funny but at times tedious goldman in this book is an asshole an entitled asshole so while the initial narrative abou
7927,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,re reading this always feels like coming home cozy and well known i love this book and characters so much i highly recommend this to everyone 
7928,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,i have no idea what took me so long to read this modern day classic yes i had seen and enjoyed the film a couple of times over the years but the book really sings and even made me appreciate the film more if you have not read the book yet get off your duff and give it a shot and then see the film again you can save your many thanks for later 
7929,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,i was not a fan of the author’s notes not at all rtc
7931,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,num num/num hello my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die 
7932,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,the princess bride is one of my favourite movies but i resisted watching it when it first came out i thought the title was dumb still do actually and hadn t heard or seen anything about it that really piqued my interest my best friend knowing my interests and convinced i d like the movie if i tried it invited me over for some other reason and had the video waiting for me so i watched and i liked it aside from thinking buttercup was too mean to westley on the farm my friend thought i 
7934,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,all the farm boy ever said to buttercup was “as you wish ” of course what he meant was “i love you” but it took buttercup some time before she realises this not until a visit from count and countess rugen when she saw the countess seemingly took a fancy of westley but just after them realising their true feelings for one another westley sailed off to america to seek his fortune in order to become a man worthy of buttercup buttercup waited and waited but news came one day that westley’s sh
7936,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,“ this is my favorite book in all the world though i have never read it ” i love everything about this book i admire goldman s intricate framework that enables him to position his own book as an old classic to hide a story within a story and to fill the pages with lovely bits of metafiction as a reader you re constantly reminded that you are in fact reading goldman draws attention to the reading experience itself in a way that is both elegant and humorous the inner story is not only a fan
7937,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,1,to start out i am fully aware that most people love this book and give it raving reviews and i am ok with that i don t think you are dumb for liking this book i am also fully aware that my taste in books not like anyone else s taste in books that i have ever met so with that in mind my review i saw the movie several years before i read the book i was an adult i did not like the movie at all so i probably shouldn t have bothered with the book in the first place but my husband loved i
7938,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,this book was inconceivably good i ve always enjoyed the movie and i happened to notice the other day how many of my gr friends had given this book such high marks so i gave it a try and this has turned into one of my favorite books there is so much depth here to this plot and characters i would put the character development as equal to or maybe even a little better than joe abercrombie at least equal too you have to hang with the plot but you begin to see how it comes together to paint
7939,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,me not love the princess bride inconceivable to be honest i didn t take to this book like storming the castle the were two full introductions about num pages before ya even got to the story but what a story it has so much of what made the movie great plus a little more depth to the characters or the reasons why certain things happened i do think that the idea of the grandfather telling the story to his child works better than the story being interrupted by the author but it all works and
7940,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die i remember watching this movie when i was younger and really loved it it was a more sarcastic take on the classic happy ending fairy tale i was excited to read the book as it was selected for a book club pick this month i absolutely loved the book and can t wait to go back to watch the movie again the characters were lifelike flaws and all i love the magical aspect fezzik death cliffs of insanity and the zoo of death 
7941,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,2,ugh i wanted to love this book and i thought i would since the movie is one of my favorites i was wrong the book is almost identical to the movie with only a few slight differences however the few differences ruined the book for me mainly buttercup was entirely unlikable in this scenario she was beautiful but brainless naive selfish and at times heartless the ending was also different but way worse and super disappointing fezzic and inugo were still their adorable lovely selves t
7942,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,wonderful book at first i have to admit i felt a bit cheated by the title it being the princess bride the classic tale of true love and high adventure because to me there was a whole lot more of high adventure than actual true love but still what a great addictive and absolutely fun read william goldman s writing is simple objective and terribly smart fast paced funny sarcastic and romantic at the right parts like in the beginning with westley and buttercup before he leaves
7943,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,well i ll echo what so many other reviewers have said this book has everything i would have wanted perhaps a little less of the author s backstory especially considering most of it was probably fiction and some of the narrative was just bizarre zoo of death but overall the sweet romance the humor the nostalgia and the epic ness of it all won me over content some instances of language or misuse of god s name some innuendo questionable narrative during the author s introduction o
7944,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,i loved it i ve seen the movie several times and it has always been a favorite of mine such memorable characters and a fantastic story i m glad the film followed so closely to the book i really enjoyed reading this the only parts that bothered me while reading were when the author kept referring back to morgenstern s version i thought those parts were unnecessary and distracted from the wonderful story but honestly the story was so lovely i m overlooking that and still giving it num st
7945,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,i can t believe i managed to go over num years without reading the book or seeing the movie i am so glad i finally have because damn i loved it i enjoyed every part and i loved the unique style of writing pretending probably not the right word but the only one that s coming to mind right now to be abridging someone else s book with notes from the abridger added in interesting effective and funny forcing my boyfriend to watch the movie with me this weekend 
7946,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,i ll admit i didn t read this book until after i saw the movie yes i saw it in the movie theatre when it first came out but i have read it multiple times since then not only is the story wonderful but the whole metafictional conceit sets it apart from typical adventure/romance novels a favorite 
7947,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,i just loved this book part of it probably had to do with my love for the movie but it was also genuinely delightful goldman is hilarious and i’ve never read another book like his with the fictitious abridgment and his clever interjections 
7948,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,nan
7949,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,despite having seen the film countless times this is still a joy to read and i would definitely recommend it to fans of the film fans of adventure stories and even those looking for a good chuckle

7951,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,one of my new all time favorite books ever 
7952,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,ruined ever so slightly by the ending but highly recommended nonetheless absolutely hilarious and charming and definitely my favourite book of the year 
7954,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,2,let me start with saying that i really really really love the movie i was so excited when my friend told me that there is actually a book i couldn t wait to read it just imagine the scene eeva sitting on her sofa on the left her fave mug with tea on the right a white blanket thrown casually on her feet the room is quiet and the air is full of anticipation she starts to read she makes it through painfully long beginning which feels like walk thorugh hell for her she makes it to the f

7958,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,i don t like buttercup i was about num when i saw this movie for the first time and even then i thought buttercup was an idiot it started when she flung herself down a mountain first she pushed westley which was cool because he was being a butt but then instead of trying to run down the hill or carefully sit on her bottom and scoot my favorite method she jumps like a wackadoodle idiot then they got to the fire swamp have you ever seen anyone more useless westley is getting his face che
7959,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,“has it occurred to you that i have gone to great effort to reach this point” buttercup is a milk maid westley is a farm boy one day buttercup realizes she is in love with westley westley immediately leaves for the americas to make his fortune and return to wed buttercup but the dread pirate roberts attacks his ship and leaves no survivors the most beautiful woman in the world is then wooed by prince humperdink is captured by a sicilian a giant and a spaniard and is chased by a dread
7960,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,most everyone is familiar with the movie of the same name why not venture back to the original source and see how much better the book is the style of goldman s writing really brings forth mirth and humor however i cannot fully describe how without revealing too much of the novel s inner workings so no spoilers from me i d encourage you to pick up the book avoid reading reviews that will give away too much and get to it i will say that many of the lines from the movie are taken directly fr
7961,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,i have always loved the princess bride i watched the movie a couple years ago and fell in love with it yes it was kind of cheesy but i laughed and laughed and fell in love with the characters i hadn t really known there was a book but the second i found out there was i bought it the story of the princess bride is told in a story within a story format there is the story of the author s experience of first being read this book originally by an s morgenstern by his dad the story wit
7962,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3, looks at the many num and num star reviews whispers the movie was better but i suppose that isn t quite fair to the book you see the movie is basically the book and the book is basically the movie the dialogue and plot are almost identical i grew up on the movie so i am biased towards it what i especially prefer about the movie however is that it cuts out a lot of goldman s voice don t get me wrong the book is genius for its originality it is really clever how he pretends to be abri
7963,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,as you wish the magical tale of a spaniard a giant a princess and a man in black what’s not to like i am a huge fan of the cult film “the princess bride” and so have wanted to read the book for years i finally found a copy in my local charity shop and so decided i would give it a go here are my thoughts i thought that whilst the main body of the book the actual tale of “the princess bride” was brilliant and just as good as the film with everything that entranced me into the world of go
7964,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,i m sure there s not much i can say about this book that hasn t already been said i mean come on it s the princess bride i m probably the last person on earth who hadn t read it i ve never seen the movie either yes i live under a rock it s a detriment to me i know this book is hilarious the humor is so dry so tongue in cheek that it tickles my particular funny bone particularly well i ll also admit that the action/adventure parts of the story had my heart thumping pretty good the r
7965,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,“she loves you she loves you still and you love her so think of that think of this too in all this world you might have been happy genuinely happy not one couple in the world has that chance not really no matter what the storybooks say ” like a true fairytale the tomboyish buttercup never meant to fall in love with the farm boy westley – it just happened and she and westley plan to spend the rest of their lives together…nothing but love ahead but when westley is killed whilst at sea
7966,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,read this for the first time since back when i was num or so unsurprisingly my impressions and memories are largely shaped by the absolute masterpiece of a movie two things stood out to me that i don t think i appreciated when i first read it first just how cynical and/or downright depressing the book version of this is the opening sequence where goldman is in california working on a movie considering allowing himself to be seduced by a starlet who wants a part reflecting on his loveless m
7967,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,5,as i read the princess bride aloud to our family i was delighted to learn how mr goldman’s father once told him this story out loud and when he tried to get his own son to read it years later and his son said it was boring he learned that his father had cut out all the boring parts and so mr goldman set to work at once writing this lovely abridged version of s morgenstern’s classic yeah … i fell for it i was halfway through the book when my husband broke it to me then i went on wikiped
7968,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,3,the story of buttercup westley et al is pretty classic and the basic frame story of this being an abridgment of a much longer novel that was precious to the author s childhood is pretty cute too bad so much real estate in the book is taken up by the semi fictional yammerings of the author concerning a what a diamond bright fucking genius he is for having written ahem abridged it b how much he hates his wife for being a shrew and his son for being fat don t worry the kid eventually
7969,The Princess Bride,William Goldman,4,from npr survey of great young adult fiction i love the movie love major quote source so i m kind of afraid to read the book will it conflict with the movie or will it enhance my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die this book was a delight the movie was very loyal to the book so most of your favorite dialogue is here notable exception to blathe in fact carol kane s character is no where to be found i listened to the audiobook read by rob rein

7972,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,if you are going to say one thing for abercrombie say he’s got catchy sayings because after all you have to be realistic about these things did you see what i did there well anyway i was about fifteen pages in and was thinking “this book seems unusually slow” then the blood started spraying in the usual abercrombie style about half a paragraph later i knew from then that this was going to be as good as what came before it the snake of talins the self made mercenary with no regret is at

7978,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,it was good but it wasn t great like the trilogy the character interactions were what made the book the plot was lacking and his writing style has never been smooth it entertaining from an action point of view and you don t have to wait for it from the prologue on it s battle guts and assassinations a killing smorgasbord 
7979,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,i love these books especially listening to them on audio the narrator is just excellent and there is a little soundtrack with slashing swords which really sets the scene the only problem is that i do not get to have the paper copies with the oh so beautiful covers best served cold is typical abercrombie fare which means it is the epitome of grimdark if you do not enjoy gritty then you will not like his books somebody dies unpleasantly on just about every other page and even the people who l

7988,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,i didn t jump right into reading ”best served cold” after finishing the author s first law trilogy and now i can remember why reading abercrombie simply leaves me emotionally drained i very masochistically put myself through the experience because afterwards once i ve let myself cool down i realize it was worth it still these books are not for everyone it s not just that they re violent gory unpredictable and full of frustratingly flawed characters it s that they leave you off or at

8004,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,joe abercrombie has always made his books a study on morality and this one in my opinion is his crowning achievement i ve recommended this book to people who haven t read the first law because i don t think you have to be particularly interested in fantasy to enjoy and understand it by enjoy and understand it i mean lose all faith in humanity and accept that this book is what did it to you it s not even grimdark where you get the psychopaths murdering and raping indiscriminately bits of
8005,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,i loved the trilogy that preceded this standalone book so much i wasn t sure how much i d enjoy a book set in the same world but featuring different characters i needn t have worried joe abercrombie breathes life into all his characters so well that i soon found myself just as interested in these newbies as i was in the characters from the previous trilogy a few familiar faces showed up too which was nice this is a dark tale of vengeance with no clear heroes and no clear villains it s actio
8006,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,num num stars i liked it but i m rounding down however to show that i didn t like it as much as the first law trilogy somewhere in the back of my mind i think i knew that right away first of all i dove in knowing it was going to be tale of revenge given the title and all but i realized not long after i started the book that the story itself wasn t going to go that much farther beyond that concept that said it did give the book a clear direction i may have enjoyed the story more in the firs
8007,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,i read the rest of this set some time ago and have been meaning to get to this one for some time i find that for me note that is for me mr ambercrombie tends to get a bit wordy the same is true here mr ambercrombie has invented some of the best characters i ve come across in recent fantasy work he as a gift for placing his characters in a bloody dirty gritty world without having to constantly point out how gritty the world is he can write a story and make the world lived in so t
8008,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,i loved abercrombie s the first law trilogy set in a richly realized fantasy world with a great cast of characters i m usually hesitant to read standalone fantasies like best served cold i prefer series so i can get to know the characters over a longer time but i was eager to revisit abercrombie s world so i picked up best served cold and i m glad i did when mercenary general monza murcatto is brutally betrayed by her employer she decides to take revenge against all odds regardless of th
8009,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,executive summary overall i enjoyed this stand alone novel more than the first law books themselves despite the lack of likable characters it s kill bill meets ocean s num in a medieval setting audio book i believe this is the first audio book i ve listened to narrated by michael page i think he does a pretty good job he is clear and easy to understand he does a variety of accents and voices i would definitely listen to another book read by him full review i enjoy mr abercrombie s writi
8010,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,num stars and you know what it s my first abercrombie and i feel cheated it was supposed to be another celebrity on my bookshelf and it is more like a still smoking caldera or a sore spot where your tooth used to be both inconvenient and annoying shame on you mr abercrombie rest assured i loved best served cold from the first pages the plot killing seven powerful people in the name of revenge the pace you kill the main protagonist and then move forward boldly the weird assortment o
8012,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,best served cold is the first of num separate standalone books by joe abercrombie after the conclusion of the first law trilogy it can be read as an introduction to abercrombie s world however a knowledge of the characters and events of the preceding trilogy provide added depth while this is my least favourite of abercrombie s num at time of writing novels it is still an extremely good read the main character is monza murcatto the snake of talins after being betrayed in the opening chapter
8013,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,best served cold is a brutal tale of revenge monzcarro murcatto was betrayed by duke orso he murdered her brother and attempted to kill her but failed now she s out for vengeance there a lot to love about this book the characters are deep the world is expansive the writing is detailed without becoming tedious most importantly the story entertaining stories live and die by their characters monza is a unlike any other character that i ve come across before she is flawed gritty scarred
8014,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,num num/num abercrombie can write him some good novels this wasn t his best that i ve read but still had me hooked and i was able to plough through it even with some limited reading time it started a little slow for me but once the gang got together to pull off a kill bill meets magnificent num type plot i was well and truly hooked the characters weren t great individually but together they worked well for me this was looking like a num star novel about a third of the way in i was really enjoy the plo
8015,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,this is easily joe abercrombie s best book and already my top read of num perhaps even of the last few years the author has a certain love for broken things and crafted some of the most memorable characters in best served cold they each have their unique voice needs fears and quirks the plot serves them and not the other way around on top of all this this may be some of the cleverest writing i ve read not just the witty dialogue but even within the prose itself abercrombie has a fi
8016,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4, num this brilliant writer completed successfully another life lesson which could be summarized with the cliche life sucks and than you die only the sucking is much worse than you could have ever thought possible you can not trust anyone everything beautiful is there to be destroyed you live and die alone and we should all be lucky to die fast the alternatives being very very undesirable abercrombie is a wonderful author and has become one of my favorites however i think
8017,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5, the earth holds no rewards but darkness if you re looking for a good one sentence summary of the predominant philosophy undergirding joe abercrombie s consistently insistently dark high fantasy that piece of internal monologue from one of the main characters of best served cold might fit the bill abercrombie plays with the limits of nihilism how far can a protagonist go before you stop rooting for him or her in this case the answer as it turns out is quite far how far can a protagon
8018,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,at first i miss glokta and bloody nine and theirs point of view but soon enough that feeling was gone and i welcomed monzcarro murcatto the serpent of talins oh what a grand trip this book was and true to its predecessors held every bit of what we liked in them i highly recommend this book and looking forward to read next two 
8019,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,num num stars like many others i picked up this book because i enjoyed really enjoyed the first law trilogy while this book isn t bad it is extremely disappointing compared to the trilogy the good num several characters from the trilogy show up in this book playing roles of various importance someone picking up this book with no other experience with mr abercrombie s work could follow along just fine but for those who read the trilogy there s some joy at recognizing the old faces and a fe
8021,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,my man crush for mr abercrombie just grew ten fold best served cold was such a fun ride that i was sad to turn the last page this is a book about vengeance revenge and what some people will do to achieve it but i think it was the characters that really made it each one of them was a truly untrustworthy person willing to stab their best friend in the back in a heartbeat throw five of them together and what do you get well alot of death for one plus tons of drama and violence i d suggest
8022,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,reread review july num this reread confirmed a few things for me one this is an extremely good book even better than the previous trilogy it s better written the format is essentially perfect it s equal parts laugh out loud funny and terrifyingly depressing the characters easily hold their own with those of the trilogy it s just an utterly readable story it also moves the overall first law plot forward in a great way but it s also my least favorite first law book why well for one 
8023,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,almost a perfect five in fact i thought it would be half way through and then it changed directions still enjoyable but not as much in my opinion it is an improvement in every way compared to the first law trilogy and i loved the characters i m a fan of the dirty dozen types of stories or like mass effect num for a newer reference or even inception and to me that was the fun part of the book reading monza building her team and how the plan fit all of them together they all had their quir
8024,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,the best way i can describe how i felt while reading this book is that it felt a lot like watching an action movie not a masterpiece just the kind of book that can be a guilty pleasure read it s dark full of action and witty abrecrombie does a wonderful job in telling a story and this was a highly enjoyable read as were his previous works but it lacked in other aspects i so enjoy when reading fantasy especially regarding the plot which is kept too simple and revolves around revenge altho
8025,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,num num 🌟🌟🌟 one cannot grow without pain one cannot improve without it suffering drives us to achieve great things this is exactly what mr abecrombie delievers here pain and suffering and torture and mutilation beyond the limits of all that s sane belief in a supernatural source of evil is not necessary men alone are capable of every wickedness and if you don t believe it already mr abercrombie will sure as hell prove it to you his characters will do just about everything that s wrong and eve
8027,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,the only way i can give num stars to best served cold is if i read it in the spirit of that wonderfully campy b movie horror classic of revenge the abominable dr phibes starring vincent price and joseph cotton and the incomparably lovely caroline munro though she’s dead and doesn’t have anything to say in the movie dr anton phibes revenges himself against the ten people whom he blames for his wife’s death using the plagues of exodus as a blueprint it’s great fun to watch price is at his

8031,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,this was an exceptionally well crafted novel the gradual escalation was perfect in nearly every respect number of characters scope of challenges stakes consequences all of it built steadily and at just the right pace to keep the feeling of things building and accelerating without rushing the foreshadowing was great and the end tied up a bunch of loose ends very neatly including some from the very beginning i had all but forgotten about by the end there were a series of flashbacks
8033,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,1,i enjoyed num endured num and then i just wanted everybody to freaking die and put me out of my misery i strongly disliked piss shit fuck snot spit incest torture and cannibalism unfortunately this was a significant portion of the text i ve read and enjoyed the blade itself but this one was not for me a note about the audible edition i thoroughly enjoyed page s narration of the lies of locke lamora but in this case his speech was too oratorical or maybe formal theater training 
8035,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,2,george r r martin praised best served cold as a “splatterpunk sword ’n sorcery” count of monte cristo i can kind of see why but at the same time the count of monte cristo is a masterpiece and one of my all time favourites so that is a tough standard to live up to in my eyes also i feel like i need to slap a huge disclaimer on this review firstly i haven’t read any of joe abercrombie’s other first law books i know that this one is a standalone so that probably shouldn’t matter i just w
8037,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,i don t want to keep repeating myself and bore you to death with my reviews of this series nothing new here in terms of the series still funny and violent with good characters if you love this series it is just more of the good stuff my fave character remains logan nine fingers and i have heard rumours of a return v excited the books are not massively different but i have to give num stars because they remian absorbing entertaining and action packed characters from previous books pop up
8038,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,ok this book is dark and i guess very dark for fantasy but compared to james ellroy for example maybe not so much yes basically the characters range from being shits to being total shits but i sort of liked that it s a book about an ex mercenary and the group of murderers she gathers to get revenge for a pretty horrendous wrong done to her by her ex employer there s no innocent farmboy who stumbles into a magical artifact which leads him onto a noble quest where he discovers both his
8039,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,revenge fantasy and by ‘fantasy’ i mean the swords and sorce—okay no just the swords kind and maces and axes and a lot of knives this is that new millennium brand of epic fantasy you know the kind that dropped all the nebulously old fashioned dialogue and portentous prophecies for a lot of fucking and people calling each other cocksucker in gritty patois it’s supposed to be more real or something i dunno i don’t think i identify any extra with a woman bent on killing the seven people wh
8040,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,best served cold is a revenge story told in the world of the first law series dark gritty raw and sometimes ugly is this story about vengeance a tale of relentless pursuit of murder many secondary characters from the first law series have roles in this novel joe abercrombie holds no punches back in his descriptive prose and he paces his stories that you often find yourself needing to catch your breath i find myself more enamored with his writing style his uniqueness and his visual s
8042,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,another great read from joe abercrombie i had no idea how this one was going to end i can t wait to read more

8044,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,damn but i’d forgotten how bloody awesome this book is darker bloodier and even more entertaining than abercrombie’s first law trilogy best served cold is the ultimate tale of revenge a tale packed with pain fury and absurdity from its spectacular opening sequence to its final poignant pages the story is of course set in the world of first law though several years after the events of the original trilogy here we are introduced to the ‘exotic’ land of styria a fractured continent hosting

8050,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,this was not my favorite abercrombie and i have to be realistic about these things but say one thing about abercrombie say he is consistent it still contained his sense of humour his glorious discription of bloody battles and his overal great writing style but sadly that was the smaller part of the book boy o boy was this book a slow one too much politics that really did not interest me at all and the characters which are usually unique and entertaining felt old and used i could not c
8051,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,this was my first read by author joe abercrombie fantastic if you are looking for a well written tale of revenge then this is the book for you however this book is not for the faint of heart abercrombie does a great job at making grey characters there really are no good guys and bad guys in this one and characters feel lifelike as they progress through the book as a quick side note it s nice to see a great standalone fantasy book in todays market which seems to cater to long series

8053,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,had so much to do the past num weeks that this took a while but i loved it however i didn t love it more than any of the books in the first law trilogy this was a different monster for abercrombie being the first i think book of his that is contained in one book instead of a series despite that i thought the pacing was fine the story was kinda predictable except for some moments that were really well done i think my biggest issue was with monza truly did not like her or enjoy reading h

8058,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,originally posted at fantasy literature i listened to tantor media’s audio version which was read by the excellent michael page this was a great format except for one chapter “to the victors…” in which mr abercrombie meant for us to be surprised by who the principal actors were in the text section breaks indicate scene and therefore character changes the audiobook reader however used the voices for the characters that mr abercrombie meant for us to think were involved when the trick
8059,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,when i participated in nanowrimo last november i attended only one of the group meetings why because when i described the plot of my book i need you to kill it was reduced to a revenge fantasy catharsis by the moderator i wasn t happy about that i didn t expect high praise or naything but i didn t expect it to be dismissed like that either meanwhile there were two other members there writing lesbian regency romance steampunk books their own descriptions of the genre and everyone else
8060,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,i was planning to write a resplendent review for best served cold but all i can say is joe abercrombie is a bad mamma jamma this guy can write powerful gripping uppercut to the chin fantasy like nobody else read his first law trilogy first then grab a copy of best served cold and enjoy here instead of me writing a bunch of supererogatory stuff where i gush about abercrombie listen to the author himself talk about the book and then just try to resist the urge to get a copy of best s

8064,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,i’m functioning on about four hours of sleep right now because i couldn’t stop reading this book last night or i guess early this morning so hopefully this review actually makes sense i am going to attempt to describe my feelings about it without fangirling but it’s going to be really really hard best served cold takes place after the events of the first law trilogy but it isn’t absolutely necessary to have read those before reading this one given that a lot of the side characters from tho
8065,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,i was at first afraid that without my favourite characters from the first law trilogy this book would turn out to be a bore i could not have been more wrong in best served cold abercrombie presents us with a whole new set of characters to like the plot is as always very interesting and fast paced it s styria and there is blood everywhere the endless twists and turns and the shifting alliances make for a nail biting read as usual abercrombie does not deal with unnecessary landscape descr
8066,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,i knew from the beginning i wasn t going to like this as much as the first law trilogy so i had my expectations slightly low from the start i think the story started out very good but ended up getting slower towards the end or rather i ended up getting a little bored of the same thing it was a decent revenge story but i ve seen too many of those and i enjoyed the side characters more than munzo herself she was a very bland character in all honesty also there was too much betrayal i know ab
8067,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,an enjoyable fun read maybe i m just burned out on the blood and guts style fantasy or maybe the mindless killing is wearing on me but there seemed to be quite a few overused plot points and a lot of jumping ahead in this book no doubt it s well written and a good book but i just didn t quite get into it like i did the first law trilogy i think my issue may be that i really really enjoy how the north men are written but not so much with the likes of monza orso etc i really enjoyed shiv
8068,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,excellent installment in the author s superbly imagined first law universe violent dark and with all the cynicism you want it had a great great ending though i would not truly call it a satndalone since most of its subtext and subtler stuff depends quite strongly on his trilogy better than laok by a lot and on par with his first num brilliant books joe abercrombie shows he can do his trademark stuff but be innovative and fresh too highly highly recommended
8069,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,“you should laugh every moment you live for you ll find it decidedly difficult afterwards ” i love joe abercrombie i make it not secret this is the first standalone after the first law trilogy it certainly did not disappoint a revenge tale at its finest one should read this just to experience the transformation that is shivers it s phenomenal i need to reread it now reread on october numth still as great as remembered shivers is one of fantasy s most underrated characters

8073,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,it seems like i started reading joe abercrombie’s best served cold eons ago but truthfully it’s only been a month or so the us version comes in at around num pages making it a hefty tome to get through in addition to this i’ve just not had as much reading time as i’d like lately and something had to give finally and with relief i finished the novel best served cold is a ruthless tale filled with cutthroat unlikeable characters including mercenaries poisoners killers politicians a
8074,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,i like joe abercrombie a lot his blog posts and in particular his re reads of his own books reveal him as a blunt introspective sometimes insecure and generally magnetic sort of guy he excels at creating complex characters with complex motivations and he subverts fantasy tropes in lots of interesting ways his first law trilogy is a seminal work of modern fantasy and i d recommend it to anyone who can stomach it so i went into best served cold with high expectations but i was actually
8075,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,springtime in styria and that means war it took me a couple of months to get around to finishing this wimpy yes i know but i m satisfied with the way things ended styria is home to the absolute scummiest of scum there we are witness to the lows humanity can reach and the true horrors one person can inflict on another not my usual sort of fantasy read but if i hadn t come to feel something for the characters then i would never have become so invested in it s ending how and when and why on
8076,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,halfway through i was loving it the initial setup the characters who couldn t trust each other the different situations they had to solve but midway through when one antagonist did the stereotypical villain speech and refusal to just get down to killing choosing instead to stretch out the kill until inevitably something improbable happens i started wondering if there was enough material in revenge to last until all the targets were dispatched you d think the antagonist had never read a
8077,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,revenge may well be a dish best served cold but no matter how you serve it it turns out not to taste as sweet as you imagined however and luckily for the reader it does give you a shit ton to chew over and savour especially if you re in the mood for another nihilistic blackly funny and brilliantly characterised look at the pointlessness of it all as monzcarro murcatto the ruthless and feared butcher of caprile is betrayed by those closest her and left for dead starting her on an orgy of

8080,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,2,i did and i didn t like this book it has some intriguing characters that could have withstood a bit more fleshing out the main character somehow ends up sitting far too pretty by the end of the story more then she deserves by half again she is for a lack of better words a hateful idiot throughout the book she fails to think more than a step or two beyond whats directly in front of her which makes the likelihood of her being a successful general a stretch just as she is stunned
8081,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,after my second read i have decided this is my favourite j a novel num 
8085,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,one of the things i ve always liked about abercrombie besides his gritty and satisfying writing is his ability to write fantasy that gives a care that feels like a real place i m also a fan of the way he creates fantasy stories that feel familiar and satisfying but twist old tropes and cliches on their head in neat ways this succeeded in all of those sections with the addition of some characters who if i didn t admire definitely held my attention that being said i liked the first half
8086,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,another gem in the first law series with a few of the supporting characters from the original trilogy taking center stage along with some awesome unforgettable new ones friendly and morveer in particular in a gritty revenge tale of unsurpassed bloodiness and wit

8093,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,best served cold tells us story about monza and her revenge but as it is told by abercombie it has all the elements which you expect from his book i e hammers blood and torture monza is a mercenary who heads the group called as thousand swords she is in the service of duke orso and she has helped him win almost num/num of styrian kingdom but she starts becoming too big for her shoes and then duke orso shows monza her place by betraying her and killing her brother in the process and throwing her
8094,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,joe abercrombie continues to astonish as a writer and storyteller he is mastering the craft this is the finest revenge story i ve ever read second only to the count of monte cristo i listened to the steven pacey audio version pacey s voice is the bedrock of abercrombie s world i recommend listening to the steven pacey reading a funny thing happened while listening to this book for nearly two thirds of the story i was convinced that i understood the overall narrative and while i was c
8096,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,best served cold has a particularly gripping start as monza and her brother are the victims of an assanation attempt successful on him but not so much on our female leading character after she recovers monza vows vengeance on everyone who had a part to play in the botched killing this novel follows her as she carries out her vengeance after the romping ride that was the first law trilogy i found myself strangely disappointed with best served cold don t get me wrong everything i love abo

8098,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,2,maybe joe abercrombie just isn t for me it certainly isn t how dark and violent his characters are i was really enjoying that in the beginning especially in stark contrast to age of myth and i wouldn t say this book had the same problem as the first law trilogy where i thought the plot was advancing at a snails pace i was immediately into the revenge story but as the book progressed i became less and less interested i understand the ending but i question the motives of a few characters
8099,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5, have a smile for breakfast you ll be shitting joy by lunch i can t believe i m going to say this folks but i m afraid to say best served cold by joe abercrombie was absolutely brilliant haha gotcha you thought i hated it didn t you never this book blew me away with its awesomeness best served cold by its very title is essentially what this book is about betrayal and vengeance abercrombie hits us here with another humorous action packed story where we see just how far someone wi
8100,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,joe abercrombie the dedication at the start of this novel says it all for grace one day you will read this and be slightly worried in his first law trilogy there was at most two decent people everyone else was treacherous deceitful sadistic egomaniacal and/or tragically deluded as a friend of mine commented the most likable person in it was a torturer as the title would indicate this is a story about ice cream it is very similar in format to kill bill although bloodier with more psy
8101,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,more of a num num but another excellent read by abercrombie i had the pleasure of shaking this man s hand recently and telling him to his face how awesome his books are and i m so glad that this one didn t disappoint he s up there with george rr martin in my books a writing style where you never know what is coming from one moment to the next and as such this novel kept me gasping throughout his plot theories don t come out of the blue but they come from a place of such imagination that i m
8102,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,num num stars it started off good but got really dragtastic and slow in the middle it was at points really dry and sort of hard to push through but it ended well enough to make up for it one thing that bothered me i never got attached to any of the characters i don t like it when characters are written so black and white good versus evil that they become unrealistic but the characters in this book are so utterly grey i had absolutely no one to root for people died and i felt like it sh
8104,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,joe fucking abercrombie people no actual need for introductions i just love saying joe fucking abercrombie this man can write like no other i swear i sink into his world so deeply it does me no good for the reason i want nothing else afterwards it s like have you ever heard a song that you got so drowned to it and couldn t focus anywhere not on the lyrics even because the sound just carried you away something similar the work he puts on his characters is next level shit and his t
8107,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,this book reads like a d d session gone horribly horribly wrong and that s a good thing maybe it s more of a commentary on who i hang out with but as i was reading this grim swords and revenge story i was repeatedly reminded of late saturday nights spent backstabbing party members for the last piece of treasure i love how over the top and crazy the set pieces in this story get it s essentially a caper/revenge movie with a dirty dozen esque cast of hard bitten killers and mercenaries 
8109,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,let me not say that this book is lacking in some pretty wonderful horrible writing how about the tragic descent of caul shivers for example seriously read the last few pages about him then go back re read the first three or four pages told from his perspective see how sad hollow that makes you feel i also enjoyed the gradual reveal that view spoiler [benna was actually a real dick his death was totally his fault hide spoiler ] plus there s just so much cosc
8110,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,a num num i may eventually round up to four rather than down to num but not yet this is a really good tale self contained but set in the same world as abercrombie s bloody nine trilogy but both the tale and the ending did not satisfy like the earlier books for once thing the tone was much coarser some will praise that as realistic but it struck more like grasping for shock value second the structure dictated by the vengeance sought led to a predictable whole third even in a world of supe
8112,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,solid num num stars a standalone novel in his first law world gives you the gritty world that abercrombie has created here we have the grand duke orso vs league of eight wonderful characters througout 
8113,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,2,best served cold was incredibly predictable for me which was so disappointing this book also had some of the most depressing moments i ve ever read i was indifferent about the majority of the characters except for shivers i had to force myself to finish this book 
8114,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,abercrombie writes like he s num and been doing it for that long 
8115,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,thoroughly enjoyed clever funny dark and gritty everything grimdark fans enjoy many betrayals twists and turns loveable rogues and downright bastards galore

8117,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,a perfect revenge story brilliant cold cynical insanely gory full of unexpected twists very satisfying 
8118,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,i sort of don t know why i m reading more joe abercrombie i read six of his books last year and didn t love any of it in fact i d probably recommend people not read the first law trilogy unless they re looking for a very particular kind of story one that s extremely pessimistic while also being pretty entertaining the thing is i ll probably read the next two standalone first law novels too i might not even enjoy them but i ll do it and i can t really say why abercrombie is becoming a mu
8119,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,the book club reaction to this book ranged from horrible to meh i was above meh but there were some big issues i liked the main character a lot i loved how your perception of her and her brother slowly shifts as the novel goes on i enjoyed the secondary characters though i wish the female ones were better developed the main issue i had was with the pacing for such a long book i needed the plot to pull me along a bit more but just as i was getting into each part that edson would be kill
8121,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,as the title suggests this book revolves around revenge it delves into examining what a person can turn into if revenge is an all consuming need what it can make people do and how it can effect the people around i loved how we got to meet some of the side characters from the first law trilogy again and that we got to see them more fleshed out and delving into their own journeys some of them were heartbreaking others quite hilarious the new characters were all fantastic as well flawed and
8122,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,2,finally it’s over i have moments when i start a book and have a need to finish it even if i don’t like it let me tell you this is the worst book to start and get stuck in that i have to finish this mood because this has num pages this is my first joe abercrombie book and as it would seem my last if i had started with the first book in the series maybe things would’ve been clearer and i would’ve understood the world but i didn’t maybe that was a mistake but now it’s too late to fix it bec
8123,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,this is absolutely better than the first law trilogy i know this is a stand alone but one does need to read the trilogy to get a better picture of wants going on as with the trilogy i found the graphic sex and graphic violence a tad more then i cared for but overall it was a great tale i loved the characters and the plot the examination of the cost of vengeance makes one question one s views on the subject but the underlying subtle subject of independence is what i appreciate even more but
8124,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,there is not one admirable character in this novel which is perfectly fine and precisely what i expect in an ambercrombie novel sometimes you re just in the mood for something grim but i mention it because there are a few really enjoyable ones for me it was not the protagonist or any of the main players one was a character by the name of friendly and the other despite the fact that he s positively repulsive in every way that matters a poisoner for the entirely unintentional i
8125,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,num num stars i thoroughly enjoyed this book and it had many fine qualities once again abercrombie s characters are awesome the only reason i did not give this book num stars is because of how much i loved the first trilogy and after reading those this book wasn t quite on the same level for me still best served cold is engaging relentlessly entertaining and well worth the time 
8126,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,i really enjoyed this book the world growth the inclusion of new factions seeing old faces and the hard boiled revenge was just so satisfying the only problem i had was with the sex scenes gratuitous and took me out of the story num num stars
8127,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,epic as always a band of misfits on the hunt for vengeance what could go wrong great story filled with its ups and downs and typical of abercrombie you get all the delightful plot twists towards the end this book will leave you gasping for more after every chapter the characters appearing in this book are so intriguing human and realistic you can t help but enjoy their foibles faults and at times heroism i also found this book to be slightly amusing considering its dark theme ven
8128,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,i was pretty excited to start best served cold for two reasons one because i’d heard abercrombie compared to george r r martin and a song of ice and fire is my favorite series two it was a standalone fantasy book which meant i wouldn’t have to invest myself in a monster of a series several months and num pages later i have mixed feelings about best served cold i enjoyed a lot of what i read but there was enough that i disliked to keep the book firmly in the realm of “liked it but didn’
8130,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,title kind of says it all some twists but fairly straight forward revenge story went on a little longer than i would have liked and i enjoyed the secondary characters much more than the mains num/num
8131,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,reviewed on my blog dragonsworn books best served cold is a stand alone novel set in the world of the first law trilogy – a series that i have previously reviewed and praised as one of the most intriguing works in modern fantasy the world goes on one thing i noted in my review of the first law was the ending having a “sour taste of unfinished business about it ” i really like this quality of abercrombie’s the world he portrays does not begin and end with the story or the characters in question
8132,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,mr abercrombie you’ve done it again the plot is full of twists betrayal and revenge galore and as always joe delivers what i have come to expect wonderful characters so three dimensional and alive that jump out of the pages i’m now adding monza cosca shivers and friendly to the list of my favourites mercenaries i can’t wait to continue this series highly recommended to fantasy fans who appreciate wit and sarcasm and can tolerate some crude language violence and sex num num stars rounded
8133,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,i gather this is a stand alone book set in the same world as the well received first law trilogy the blade itself before they are hanged the last argument of kings but i hadn t read any of those or anything else by abercrombie prior to picking this up i was drawn to the book by a review that emphasized how it was a dark and gritty alternative to standard fantasy epics my taste in fantasy always ran toward the darkly humorous stuff like fritz leiber s newhon stories rather than the epic
8134,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,a review of joe abercrombie’s best served cold as i preface all of my reviews i want to begin by stating that this review is a personal opinion only and should be taken as such as i am hardly the arbiter of what is good or bad this should in no way deter someone from purchasing this novel best served cold is an ugly novel about extremely ugly and brutal people doing extremely ugly and brutal things to each other in the name of power or revenge even the rather explicit sex scenes in this novel
8135,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,i wrote down while reading this this book is like a parker novel and it is i ve seen other reviewers talk about the count of monte cristo i can t see that personally monza has no long cons in her she goes straight after those who have done her wrong i had some problems with the book abercrombie uses a lot of refrains a lot of refrains sometimes it works stylistically sometimes it s confusing i believe intentionally but it is used so frequently that towards the end i m no longe
8136,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,by the glory of slaanesh joe abercrombie just puts out one fantastic fantasy release after another the first num books were amazing with each one consecutively getting better and this novel doesn t break that trend the book is broken into several parts from monzcarro murcatto or monza and her brother being betrayed to her travelling all across the country taking revenge for that betrayal and leaving plenty of blood bodies and hate in her wake the novel is insanely well written each part take
8138,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,abercrombie writes really well but unfortunately a lot of this book just felt like too much writing was present this is at heart a story all about revenge and one woman s quest to get it no matter what the cost it is interesting well thought out and full of plenty of twists and turns and daring and bloody violence but for me was missing something there is plenty to recommend this book the characters are extremely well thought out and unique individuals the writing is both readable and
8139,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,num num stars i really enjoy a lot of things about abercrombie s writing and i enjoyed this book too just not nearly as much as the first law trilogy which for the uninitiated begins with the blade itself one thing i love in his writing is his gritty painful raw descriptions of violence i m not a fan of gratuitous violence nor am i a teenager with any kind of violence fetish much the opposite really i m a num something english teacher who is averse to anger and who likes us all to get
8140,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,my feelings regarding this book are mixed in that i kept comparing it to two books one recent and one old the recent one is the lies of locke lamorra with the old one the count of monte cristo the first comparison is i think valid in that both are written by contemporaries and both deal with revenge they both exhibit witty dialog and although loll isn t as gritty and dark they both deal with ugly things i won t discuss comc as a comparative as it was written in a different time
8141,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,2,i always pay close attention to the first sentence in any book a tone is being set if nothing else but often the focus of what follows is revealed in just a few words so when i began “best served cold” orbit num num num pages and read “the sunrise was the colour of bad blood ” i figured joe abercrombie was going to be taking me on a bloody dark ride sadly i was correct and “best served cold” is num pages of blood betrayal bones agony betrayal blood bones and more agony and rea
8142,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,best served cold further explores new and old characters in the first law series d we are introduced to the character of monza murcatto a ruthless cold blooded minded mercenary with a somewhat chewy centre who does her best to hide it by being a ruthless cold blooded mercenary d a large proportion of the book revolves around her and her quest for vengeance d she is portrayed in a great way that will you wishing her to succeed but at the same time you always suspect that she may have the ru
8143,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,almost too much of a good thing in this blistering novel from abercrombie he has always tempered the inherent darkness in his stories with humor and a well rounded approach to character and irresistible narrative pull the narrative energy and character strength are not lacking but this book is just so beastly bleak that the humor may seem almost ill placed the only resistance to reading that this book gave me was in absolutely dreading what would come next for the characters that i had becom
8144,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,this is a very nice followup to abercrombie s amazing first law trilogy his writing continues to be excellent and and i look forward to reading his newest book the heroes although probably not any time soon there s only so much blood agony and betrayal i can take and this book more than met my monthly quota maybe my yearly quota best served cold is even more violent than the trilogy believe it or not by the end i was becoming wearied and numbed by all the killing possibly the author w
8145,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,i don t really understand why this author s novels get such rave reviews i have abandoned some of his books previously due to boredom with the writing style but i decided to try this one on recommendation i liked the characters well enough and the plot was decent but i just don t enjoy this author s style of writing i never care about the characters much and occasionally find the author is deliberately obtuse in his writing so he can surprise you all it does is pull you out of the story a
8146,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,this was a great follow up to the first law trilogy which if you haven t read you should before you read this yes best served cold is a stand alone but there are tons of tie ins to first law that you ll miss if you read this first this one loses a star for two reasons num the story gets a little repetitive in places the writing s still really good so this isn t a huge problem but after a while you can pretty much predict the general structure of each section that s not to say there are no s
8147,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,as a huge fan of joe s first law trilogy i went into this with high expectations anyway and i didn t come away disappointed vivid and well established characters and some nods to previous characters in the trilogy which were appreciated the battle scenes as always are satisfyingly brutal bloody and graphic and the smut oh the smut cutting this short i loved this book i loved the characters i love mr abercrombie s style and kind of gritty realism he always seems to maintain i love ho
8148,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,abercrombie s prose is tight and evocative and just a little bit okay a lot profane in that regard this book is just as good as his first law trilogy but i just didn t enjoy myself as much in this one it took me forever to get through and while i always had a good time while i was reading the thing i never felt that urgency that s the best part about reading fantasy about reading any good book really but i feel it most often with genre stuff i guess i m just not that interested in
8149,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5, kin ell what a book about halfway through i was grousing to myself it was taking too long even went and looked up how it ended because i couldn t be bothered to read all the way through quickly and i was curious kept on reading of course because its a fantastic crew of characters first law i struggled with because most of them had the most punchable souls seen outside piers morgan s dressing room but here they re great not always likeable but there s always something to them it all com
8150,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,a note here because it s too long to be a note p this could be so good i almost felt rescpect for the author when monzacarro murcatto shylo vitari and day were interrogating carlot dan eider then we got to the long unnecessary cringy dick oriented fake abusive sex scenes that came out of nowhere after dispersion of the gang we see women in ones like fookin sore thumbs in the oceans of testicles why is it always the same you re able to create a whole new world and can t make space
8151,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,i think this was the best of the bunch so far at least in respect to the book arc story it was a fairly simple revenge story while not being quite the simple at all i ve decided that joe abercrombie is using this series for character studies and that the story is just a framework for those character studies all of the characters are at once personable and difficult to like noble and contemptible just about the time i get attached to a character enough to want to start cheering for them the
8152,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,first off it’s a standalone book and just based in first law world one doesn’t need to have read previous books to read this one as for the book itself i enjoyed it especially for its ending which is full of irony and satire the book has lots of detailed action many twist and turns politics mixed with war and tons of black humor the story is straight forward that of revenge the process of vengeance brings in a group of extreme characters each one unique and colorful in their own way the
8153,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,well what can i say i loved it obviously hence the num stars it continues to amaze me how good abercrombie really is lord grimdark indeed if you are looking for poetry to rival the iliad you won t find it here what you will get is an honest and brutal account of the true cost of vengeance our hero monza cuts a bloody trail across styria to inflict death on those that tried to kill her in the process she plunges the entire country even deeper into war that has all kinds of repercussion
8155,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,monza murcatto bad bitch with a heart kind of this book was fantastic i d initially read it about num years ago and flew through the pages i really took my time on the re read and man it was worth it joe abercrombie creates some great ruthless characters monza murcatto who s hell bent on vengance caulfield shivers who wants to be a better man but just can t seem to get there nicomo cosca the sarcastic pontificator morveer the narcissistic poisoner and on and on the heroes is my fav
8156,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,how to review a book that s simply brilliant if all you re interested in is if it s brilliant or not then read no further it s brilliant a lot of friends insisted that this was abercrombie s best book praise doesn t get much higher than that personally i wouldn t go that far but only because i d give the first law trilogy num stars and best served cold num unfortunately num is as high as it goes them s the rules i ve actually already read the heroes way back and enjoyed it but i m lookin
8158,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,a chance to hear what happened to some of the characters from the first law trilogy and a chance to get to know others better as well as a whole new group as the title suggests the book is about revenge but there is more than one person out there with a grudge do find that the northerners are my favourite group though i tend to imagine them sounding like sean bean with the first three books there was logen now it s caul shivers 
8159,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,nicomo cosca i m in love there s no sand dan glokta in this book but nicomo is entertaining enough oh and to keep all the characters in the shady side that s brilliant you cannot see which one is the villain and which one is the hero because no one is they do things because they have to and to decide whether they are good person or not by that motive is entirely unfair love this so much 
8160,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,terrific everything that i ve come to love about abercrombie s works perfected to a spit shiner polish and amped to gravity defying levels violence black humor pacing and impossible to predict morally ambiguous characters that you loathe and love at the same time here is the longer version bit ly/numsnumea
8162,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,although i did enjoy this one by mr abercrombie i thought it felt a bit rushed and might have been better with some more fine tuning i didn t find it as engaging as his signature trilogy but it was still entertaining and kept my attention i will probably return to read his other stand alone books at some point but i ll put them on the back burner for the time being 
8163,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,abercrombie s first stand alone after writing the first law it can be read separately but there are easter eggs for those who have read trilogy first like the title implies this book is about revenge and as such it s a pretty dark book the unrelenting depressing tone is almost too much with one character falling the farthest of any of abercrombie s cast so far num num out of num 
8164,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,my biggest complaint is that none of the characters were likeable and also the book was ridiculously long regardless i enjoyed the book abercrombie is one of my favorites i wish i had reread the first law books before i started this one although it s a stand alone book i didn t remember much about the first law characters that appeared in this book 
8165,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,5,simply excellent cameos from the previous series and a couple of retained characters but entirely new and all about human relationships and the searing emptiness of hate the ending is marginally less dour and stalinist than abercrombie s previous books but not comparable to traditional fantasy fare by any stretch of the imagination can t say enough good things about it 
8166,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,actual rating num num stars a book of tarnished characters abercrombie doesn t do black or white pure goodness and pure evil he likes to give all his characters a good mix of both i was not able to warm to the characters to the same degree as in the preceding trilogy as you d expect from such a book it was full of treachery and murder with a dash of humour thrown in to soften the impact 
8167,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,4,joe abercrombie is one of the greatest of this generation fantasy writers this book was full of blood and full of comedy i get stunned how he combines these two when there is blood bath there are lines that made me laugh out loud i liked the character cosca and shiver god bless joe abercrombie 
8168,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,3,never think i m really going to enjoy abercrombie the start was great and the more grimy than mud is done well there was even a sex scene which was remarkably interesting but he just doesn t do endings well imo in fact i find them so bad that the rest of the story unravels from there 
8169,Best Served Cold,Joe Abercrombie,2,this novel would have been better if it were half as long as it is you’d think the author was getting paid by the word an interesting story that is simply too long the rating would have nearly doubled with proper length num of num stars

8191,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,when i first read lackey s cute magical horseys magic schools for angstier than thou kids and also occasional off page orgies which is how i remember this series from my childhood okay i ended up reading arrows of the queen and a few later volumes quite a few times but somehow never made my way back to one that is perhaps among the best known parts of the series the last herald mage trilogy first i didn t read them because they weren t available in my favourite library then i didn t
8192,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,num num this to me wasnt the most groundbreakingly original fantasy novel im especially tired of random nonsense made up languages that appear and have all these apostrophes and arent translated in any way and make zero sense also for a short fearful moment i almost thought this was going to be a really sexist world setting but it wasnt at least not more sexist than our beautiful actual universe is either plus it actually features badass female characters which is rlly a good aspect good thing
8193,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4, reread in num just because okay my first thought is that description for goodreads actually only barely touches on the time period in which the book takes place and even then still gets a lot of things wrong kind of sad given that it s only a paragraph long now onto the real review this was the first valdemar book i ever read and it was the one to hook me reel me in and never let me go every time i pick it up and read it i m taken back to a hot lazy summer in which my friend hande
8194,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,2,smothered by his oppressive country family vanyel is given a second chance when he s sent to the city to live with his aunt a herald instructor but his maturation begets tragedy and magic and perhaps war magic s pawn seems intended to be a powerful emotional journey of love and loss but lackey expresses almost no understanding of human emotion vanyel lives in emotional extremes his character growth is delineated and repetitive and most of all his experience and reactions are both so tr
8195,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,wow i just finished this book and i gotta say that i can really see a high school girl swooning over it soooo much angst sooooo much melodrama sooooooo much pretty ponies soooo much well adolescentness i can see it all the way otoh as an adult i have to do a lot of head shaking for some of the very same reasons the main character vanyel is a self absorbed self pitying jerk of a teenager for most of the book fortunately he s supposed to be a self absorbed self pitying jerk of a

8198,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,i got the strangest urge to reread this trilogy today it seems like a bad idea i loved this in highschool but i am sure it is not going to live up here is everything that i disjointedly remember about these books they are basically a torrid gay love story for teenage girls vanyel is the main character and he is very pretty and very angsty and no one understands him so he goes to live with his aunt or something he wants to be a bard bards are like magical
8199,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,i liked vanyel goodreads consensus seems to be that he s a whiny little shit and i m not saying that s not true but i liked him for his being a whiny little shit once in a while you re allowed to be vanyel has bad luck with pretty much everything he doesn t like up to his father s inflexible ideas of masculinity he s being beaten for being effeminate and no one understands him two out of the three are actual legitimate grievances and if you think this angst is overblown just wait until
8200,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,an emotionally destructive book it started out so typically ya and then was like surprise not a ya this is open heart surgery btw we just ran out of anesthesia strap in content warning view spoiler [ homophobia child abuse suicide death of a loved one hide spoiler ] things to love van and lendel they are a great young couple who work to bolster each other it s wonderful to see relationships built on mutual respect and affection when so often in books it seems there s a skewed dy
8201,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,there s lots of praise and lots of laughing about mercedes lackey s books either of which apply for those of her books i read alike but still despite constantly reoccuring elements that would bug me into stopping to read other books altogether i never can put one of her books down it s no different with magic s pawn first in the trilogy on vanyel a character in the valdemar universe this book has everything absolutely too many italics and bold print angst more angst over the top magic
8202,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,i have liked this book more than i have expected i m not a typical fantasy fan and i have never read anything by mercedes lackey first of all the person who wrote the blurb should be banished from writing anything else in his or her life we have undoubtedly read two different completely books the blurb says vanyel is some kind of self centered prick who was born with a great magical power while in my book he is a very miserable boy who has never known he has magic in him and who probably wo
8203,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,i don t normally like mercedes lackey books i m not certain why but most of her stories leave me cold and i forget about them shortly after i close the cover of the book but magic s pawn is different i truly care about vanyel ashkevron the main character of this series he is handsome and proud and arrogant and lonely and desperate and scared and insecure all at once there are moments in the story when i wish he would be a little less insecure and chin up but those moments are rare most
8204,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,and holy crap while i m reminiscing i think in this trilogy he died at the end and his horse maybe died too oh and the cover art on these books is subtly seasonal right with book num having all like winter imagery book num like summerish and book num with falling leaves and things because you knew his life was almost over omg so sad i wonder what would happen if i re read these whether it would blow my mind and i d regress back into sci fi dom or if they d turn out to be horribly deriva
8205,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,oh my gosh were do i even begin i cried a lot reading this book i connected to the main character on a very deep level that is very personal to me i don t no what to say about this story except that it was beautifully sad it could just be that i m an emotional sap and that s okay this book also gave me more respect for same sex relations not that i ever had any thing against same sex relationships but theirs always that little voice in the back of my head that most strait people have tells
8206,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,re read num i love to re read vanyel s story re read num vanyel askeveron is another of my favorite valedmar characters his story is told in one of the trilogies about early valdemar his life though fairly easy due to his father being lord of his own lands still has many difficulties that lead him to haven and the early collegium his story is the first one i had ever read with a homosexual as the main character and it really meant something to me it gave it a normality that just isn t se
8207,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,magic love tragedy courage magic creatures and a fantastic world building what else should i want from a fantasy nothing it has all loved it and i want to read more to know how the saga will end i fear it van s path is full of wonders but also pain and i felt his pain in this book will the next hurt and bring so much join again i have to read to know and i will num stars
8208,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,num num stars num num star off for too much hurt for lendel and for the very weird lull in the middle of the book liked it otherwise will probably read it again just not the rest of the series seeing how the author likes to do away with the characters we get attached to 
8209,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,2,look sometimes you want to read challenging literary works and sometimes you want to read light fantasy about pretty boys weeping emo tears into the manes of their soulbonded magic horses don t judge me 
8210,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,one of the best series in the valmair series it is a must read if you like these books you will like buring brightly and the vow and oath series 
8211,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,i read these forever ago and they ll always have a special place in my heart 
8212,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,very good and gay and there are magic horses who are nice 
8213,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,num num stars from me this was so much better than i thought it would be really interesting characters the main is super powerful which i looove and his character developement in just the first book was fascinating it also deals with important topics like grief finding oneself how to trust and open up to others lgbt themes and chosen family which is right up my alley i m very excited about where the plot is going in the next two books it was sometimes a tiny bit confusing for me personally
8214,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,num num i had a really hard time getting into this and the rating would be two stars if the last quarter of the book hadn’t gotten a little more interesting vanyel is just an annoying character who cannot seem to get past himself i know he’s sort of supposed to be self centered and foolish but it was just such a pain to read the romantic relationship felt silly and like it happened far too quickly the plot’s rise and fall felt strange there was a lot happening and not a lot happening all at
8215,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,so much of this book was so irritating but something kept me reading and engaged in the story the mind speak is the worst not only is the concept of it annoying but that it s stylized with colons and italics the companions are horrible flat characters all the men are beautiful she uses excessive quotation marks for no reason it felt like yfandes and all of the magic terminology drives me crazy they used mind speak in private mode at one point seriously that s the terminology you 
8216,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,no great literature i have no idea how lackey thought dashes and semicolons were supposed to be used and it s a bit pulpy/hysterical at times but it s so /passionate/ i ve read stories that were about on par with mp s quality but without half the passion and i couldn t get through them mp could occasionally drag a bit but lackey allowed her characters to feel and suffer and reveal themselves so freely and with such a sense of entertainment or you know something less disrespectful
8217,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,i have not been so engaged in a story quite so vividly before i tried to read slowly to pace myself but about halfway through the book i refused to put it down i was there i was vanyel and i felt his pain his anger i cheered for him this is the very first book of mercedes lackey i ve ever read and i m absolutely looking forward to reading the rest of vanyel s story as well as other books by this amazing author i highly highly recommend 
8218,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,full review here http //jamesgenrebooks blogspot com/num that this book still affects me so is evidence of its narrative power 
8219,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,if it weren t recommended by c s pacat i won t even find this valdemar universe in goodreads the last herald mage series is one of the sub serieses of valdemar series but as i gathered from valdemar s fans it s not necessarily to read the sub serieses in chronological order to dive into valdemar easily so i skipped its predecessor the mage wars series entirely and started from this series instead needless to say the world building is magnificent the companion and its chosen the
8220,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,well now this book took me to that magic place the place where things happen in my head how can you not love this story finally a boy who does not want to fight with swords and be the strongest most badass and powerful man alive no vanyel just wants to be a bard to sing a boy who has always felt left out never understanding why finally comes into his own it is a high tale of fantasy of magick of the best kind of great endeavors and great pain of love for animals and people alike 
8221,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,i happened to remember this book while posting an opinion on the amazon discussion board about romance basically about the lack of risk in the romance genre in my posting i mentioned the character of vanyel as an example one of the first gay male heroes in fantasy fiction however magic s pawn is far more than just a story about his sexuality in many ways i see it as the precursor to the harry potter series vanyel is a young man with rare talents who doesn t fit in with the hidebound n
8222,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,aww bb vanyel when i read arrows of the queen i didn t know that the book talia is reading at the beginning was actually going to be a story we d get to read vanyel is mentioned a bunch of times throughout talia s story so we know a bit about what is going to happen to him and what he ll do but not how he gets there warning this book has a lot of teen angst and if you don t like that sort of thing you should stay away from this book basically horrible things keep happening to vanyel s
8223,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,1,i read this book and the full lhm trilogy many many years ago and really remembered it largely as being horribly tragically soul suckingly depressing not so much because of vanyel but because of the herald magery going away on at long last reading it again i find myself being depressed more by just how godawfully bad this book is melodramatic to bathetic gay romance doesn t begin to describe it there s a terrible waste of interesting characters in service to the most emo angsty
8224,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,i feel like i need to explain this one mercedes lackey was easily my favorite author when i was a kid i was obsessed i wrote heralds of valdemar fanfiction i ran heralds of valdemar roleplay sites all i talked about was this series of books but for some reason my parents didn t have this book and i knew from having read the second two in the series that they featured a gay guy with a magic talking horse and oh my god guys i just can t describe how desperately i needed this book so i told
8225,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,don t get me wrong this isn t a stunningly well written trilogy but i have always enjoyed it i guess for its tragic story arc this is one of mercedes lackey s series set in valdemar a world with companions intelligent horses magic bards bond birds and of course various and sundry foes this however is by far my favorite of any of the valdemar series vanyel while initially a difficult to stomach troubled youth turns out to be quite the tragic hero he s somewhat of a failed bard turn
8226,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,vanyel ashkevron is the eldest son and heir apparent to a rural lord but his aspect doesn t quite fit the role vanyel is attractive gentle and musical instead of being burly aggressive and undereducated in other words vanyel is gay which doesn t usually work out well in what is essentially a feudal society after a great deal of abuse at the hands of his family vanyel is shipped off to haven to live with his aunt a herald he finally meets someone and falls in love but that has probl
8227,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,2, possible spoilers vanyel is pretty boy who prefers music over fighting his father is constantly pushing him to man up seeing that his methods are not working he sends v off to his sister savil who trains magic users vanyel is utterly depressing and wears his arrogance as a shield to let no one affect him at the school he meets a mage named tylendel who sees v for who he really is and they fall madly in love from there it s like romeo and juliet exce
8228,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,2,awful just awful amateurish writing italics everywhere and everyone acts like book characters rather than real people annoying nicknames angst everywhere vanyel is utterly pathetic everyone would be better off without me again and again and again completely self indulgent wangst savil and tylendel s relationship is weird and inappropriate she s his trainer and mentor why is she joking with him about the sex he s having with vanyel and urgh vanyel s relationship with tylendel i
8229,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,i m now so far behind the rereads on tor com that i may never catch up i haven t dared go and look where they are up to but i did finish this one i did so at a time when i was feeling emotionally very fragile and stressed so it s a credit to lackey s writing that this book which i think is probably her best ever held up and i still loved the story despite its difficult subject matter at times i would like to get on with magic s promise but i m trying to take things slowly and as they com
8230,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,this is one of my favorite books and the first i read by mercedes lackey the rest of her books seem to be a variant on this basic theme but as far as her books go this and the rest of the last herald mage series is probably the pinacle of writing on this theme when i first read this my ability to relate to the protagonist hit me like a ton of bricks i had a good long cry read it again and have since always kept a copy handy i typically read this when i m having a really rough we
8231,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,2,reading reviews completely spoils this book for me as me self i cant finish not because whiny protagonist or why everyone pity the hero honestly i don t even bothered by those points the thing i cant grasp is how supposedly a grandma talking with young adult with no character like it was a one sided conversation given by the same person i just cant distinguish them and connect with how they think and behave like seeing this world in another dimension entirely heh i do agree tho
8232,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,i really enjoyed this book as a gay kid vanyel s story is very relatable well as much as it can be in a fantasy setting for those saying it s so melodramatic well that s typically how it is when you re a closeted gay kid who can t live up to his father s expectations of manliness and who worries all his loved ones will abandon him if they knew it sucks the fantasy aspect is also really good and the story was interesting enough to get me to the end i ve already bought the second
8233,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,i haven t been into sci fantasy before but this was much more love magic family complications empowerment companionship lose of love survival numth century sorcery numst century venacular numth century author and today s relevance truly emotional this caught my attention from a high school friend s recommendation to another friend of his nothing i have ever read has more completely described my experience growing up the best description of what it is like to grow up gay in a world
8234,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,2,dnf i read half the writing was clunky little happens the characterization wasn t done well the descriptions of the protagonist were repetitive and he isn t likable i was bored but kept expecting the plot to get going at any moment so i stuck with it there was a surprise a little less than halfway through but then it continued to be boring by halfway i realized i didn t actually care about the plot or when the protag might find out he has magic or when the larger conflict would sta
8235,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,this is the first book in the first series ever to make me weep it s a series that you ll either love or hate there is no gray area in between thankfully i had already had a friend come out of the closet and had kicked the male preconceived notions of homosexuality this book almost worships the male relationship if you can open your mind enough to simply look at it as love this series is phenomenal 
8236,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,2,oh my did i love this book with white hot passion when i was num which was long enough ago that i could not go online and find other fangirls to create fanfic with although a few years later we did try to put together valdemush but alas lackey s lawyers stopped us now well i can t judge it fairly now it s just too impossible to read it without remembering my younger self being absolutely astonished and in love with this book 
8237,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,2,gosh the melodrama do num year olds really suffer from such violent mood swings i can t fault mercedes writing she tells a compelling story the dreamspinner press copy of the book i had was full of typos but the original published book i read a long time ago was not once a long time ago this was just my cup of tea but in a re read i m too old too cynical and too much for stark realism thus my rating isn t for the writing or the plot but my enjoyment 
8238,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,i was obsessed with this book when i was young with the insight of age i can see its flaws chief among them a certain amount of emotional immaturity but i owe an awful lot to this story as a writer and a person spoilers van loses his lifemate and everyone around him is pretty much sick of him whining about it in a month a month people this is a problem that dogs her writing in my opinion 
8239,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,i read this trilogy years ago when i was on a field training exercise in the army i was desperate for something to read so this girl loaned them to me i remember them as being fun quick reads that kept my interest without being something that demanded a lot of concentration i might be rating them a star higher than they re worth because of the nostalgia factor but if you like girly fantasy stories and you need something to read on a plane then these would do the trick 
8240,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,this is a classic fantasy series and the first one that i every read that featured a gay man as the lead it still remains one of my all time favorite fantasy series to this day i grew up on these books and would encourage any young adult or adult fan of fantasy to give them a try i would also recommend these books to animal and horse lovers 
8241,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,1,didn t finish it i found vanyel tedious and the writing grating and a little amatuer it s probably the kind of book i would have enjoyed in my early teens when factors such as the writing style wouldn t have bothered me 
8242,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,a series with real importance to a closeted young gay kid struggling with coming out and yes i re read the series when working on blue rose for green ronin publishing 
8243,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,1,this book reads like a fanfic written by a twelve year old i might have liked it at that age but i d like to think i had better taste unless you re a preteen looking for an unbelievable and saccharine tale of forgettable camp characters avoid this one 
8244,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,this is another rating that is more reflects the nostalgia i get from re reading this book than the actual book itself there are definite flaws but this book is like comfort food a lot of empty calories but the experience gives me warm fuzzies 
8245,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,just adding this book to complete the five starring of this trilogy for my readinghistory i hopelessly screwed up the order of these books sigh i m sure you re all smart enough to figure it out though 
8246,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,been a long time since i re read this and i forgot how annoying vanyel is in this one i wish there had been more relationship development almost too short solide num num 
8248,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,2,i read the whole thing 
8249,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,oh silly talking horses 
8250,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,this book ripped my heart out if you want a happy gay romance with magic and pretty unicorns put this book down right now it’s not for you vanyel ashkevron grows up with huge disadvantages for one he does not even know what shay’a’chern means the tayledras word for homosexual that anyone could love another of the same sex and second his father is trying to force on him his own idea of a manly man basically a war hero—something that goes against vanyel’s very nature vanyel has a strong
8251,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,great series vanyel was a whiner but you can t help but mourn his losses anyway 
8252,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,this book was an interesting interesting little piece of gay history for me this was one of the first novels starring a gay protagonist i ever picked up as a young gay man who wanted to enjoy more self representative works even though i only just got around to reading it released in num i wasn’t surprised to find that this was one of the first fantasy novels starring a heroic gay character ever and the book deserves major credit on that alone this very fact divides my opinion to some ext
8253,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,probably groundbreaking for its time i write this review knowing this book was written in the nums and so was way ahead of its time by having a gay main character and exploring gay relationships but the representation is just steeped in tragedy and misery relentlessly the mc vanyel starts out understandably miserable considering his crappy lot in life as a unloved weakling artsy son of a macho strongman provincial lord of a father but as the book goes on vanyel it seems just whines
8254,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,gosh i had high expectations of this one and it blew them away let me start off by saying i read all of this in essentially one sitting on the airplane from utah to florida so yeah it all felt a little fast paced but bear in mind it might have been a little more fleshed out than i remember either which way i ll start at the top i was a closeted homosexual for many years but before i knew what homosexuality even was i was experiencing homophobia for being a tomboy lol vanyel is very
8255,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,this book no vanyel broke me into itty bitty pieces for a long time i ve been wondering how he ll ever be a herald not that he behaved evilly or something but some people are just not wired that way in order to be a herald and then sobs i really liked the lovestory between tylendel and vanyel and how lendel managed to draw van out and let him see that there isn t just loneliness and pain and hurting and then yeah i m a bit angry at lendel i get him a bit but still and poor p
8256,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,i can t really separate out the book that magic s pawn is from the work that it s doing and the time in which it was written a mainstream fantasy author writing in the late num s following the aids epidemic when homosexuality was stigmatised and attacked by governments and celebrities wrote a coming of age novel where a teenage gay protagonist is rejected by his parents faces death and depression and considers suicide but finds love and unconditional support with an adoptive family w
8257,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,this book was unexpectedly fantastic it starts interestingly enough but vanyel as the main character quickly becomes tedious he comes across as arrogant and childish and you can t fault the fact that everyone that interacts with him isn t overly fond of him except for tylendel the story picked up even more when the relationship between vanyel and tylendel starts the character development of vanyel as he starts to grow up is such a startling change you can t help but forgive everything he
8258,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,vanyel is not the eldest son his parents were hoping for small of stature fair of face and with no talent for combat with heavy arms he s the object of abuse and ridicule by his father his father s advisers and even his younger brother his heart s desire is to be left to himself to play his instruments and to eventually study with the bardic college but finally fed up with vanyel s inadequacies his father forces him to pack his bags and sends him away to live with his no nonsense aunt s
8259,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,1,this came very well recommend off a reddit thread when i was looking for fantasy literature with queer leading characters but boy was i unimpressed a good third or half of the book is an endless allegory for the pain of being queer in a world that over appreciates brutality and virility i understand it s probably very relatable if you re reading it as you re going through it but so incredibly boring if you ve already processed all of it i also applaud authors who choose to write character
8260,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,2,dnf num num i am honestly really disappointed with this one i d heard such good things about it that i would absolutely love it since it was high fantasy and had gay characters but eeeek nope did not like it it started off really slow i thought that maybe i just needed to get a bit further before i could get in to it but num pages in i m still not enjoying it and as it goes on the dialogue and dynamics between the characters are suuuper weird is this what fantasy writing was
8261,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,this is one book i can pick up anywhere at anytime and read vanyl s character development hits home for a lot of people myself included especially his idea that by not reaching out to others he ll prevent himself from getting hurt he takes on various personas of a typical teenager which is why his story and experiences resonate with so many readers i especially love his relationships with his family mentors lover and companion yes i always cry when he meets yfandes especially becau
8262,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,mmm so this isnt what i expected basically i thought this book was going to be about a boy who is sent to his aunts to be more manly meets a boy and falls in love then when his bfs twin is murdered they go on a dangerous quest for revenge together where vanyel develops magical powers and like thats kinda what happened but that all happened in the first num whatever percent of the book i didnt realize this was bury your gays and so after the whole vengeance and magical powers bit the bo
8263,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,1,bought this during my quest to find gay books couldn t even make it to the halfway point on this one despite the fact that it has pretty good reviews what s more this isn t the sort of couldn t get into it book that you can come back to and try again later this is more like the i wish i hadn t bought this book that you intend to get rid of as soon as the opportunity arises i don t want to be too harsh because people who quit books before finishing are the ones who miss out on the part
8264,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,in reality i would give this book a num num i ve become a fan of mercedes lackey recently for the nostalgia her writing gives me for moments i never had i wish i had come across this series when i was num like so many people leaving reviews while this book was enjoyable it felt a lot shallower in its approach than the books i ve read so far from this world a bit too melodramatic for my taste vanyel has had a tough life and there s no denying it but the level of submission he shows and takes so
8265,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,this is by far my favorite of all her books then again i read this in high school and i think i fell a little in love with vanyel his character was rich and i could feel what he was going through even though i couldn t relate his life at all i read the book so much the cover fell off i taped it back on and then again when it fell off i still have the original book and until the last few years since it is packed away with all most of my library i would go back and read it over and over and
8266,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,num num nostalgia reread i think i first read this in the early num s and i remember that i loved it i bought the whole series and i still have them sitting on my shelf and since it s been num years since i read them i decided to read them again i liked it but i didn t love it as much as i thought i would and definitely not as much as i used to i like vanyel but sometimes i wanted to smack him because he was so damn dramatic teenage me loved that adult me not so much the story also
8267,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,pretty solid lackey is pretty reliable for all that she writes in very different genres vanyel was an insufferable twit and difficult to like which was the whole point i understand that vanyel just does not fit in at forst reach his father s holding while he is the heir to the hold he is not what his father wants him to be and vanyel is fine with that but when withen sends him away to the capital to be fostered by his aunt savil vanyel see s this exile for what it really is he has al
8268,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,re read this book which i just loooooved when i first read it i was a bit hesitant would it live up to re reading with over twice as much life lived in between or would i throw it aside as youthful folly i have been reading some of her later works but really not been that enamoured with them was that because the books were less enthralling or because i was less easily enthralled fortunately it turns out it was the former i still loved this book less than when i was the target young ad
8269,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,1,oh man this book was brutally tough to get through i found vanyel incredibly whiny and he grated on my last nerve from the very beginning so much whining and moaning and groaning about his fate without actually doing anything about it he s one of those characters to whom things happen rather than being proactive about his fate in the world i also found the writing incredibly repetitive the same point was driven home again and again page after page reminding us of things we already learn
8270,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,so this was a reread i devoured this series like my life depended on it when i was in high school but i haven t touched them since then but i was looking for literary comfort food so i decided to go back and give them another look and oh geez does this not stand up looking at this now vanyel is a whiny self pitying narcissist the plot is thin to the point of nonexistence and the abuse of stress italics might actually be killing me and by today s sensibilities the tayledras are a kind
8271,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,admittedly i picked this book because of the cover there s a horse and she even has a role in the story i m not sure if i will finish this entire series i enjoyed the writing but the plot as well as characterization left me a little cold it s definitely one of the better fantasy books and the audio version i read had a pleasant narrator who managed to bring the story to life i found myself more interested in the side characters than the hero which seems to be a pattern with me there
8272,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,this book was very entertaining i found the main character vanyel very fleshed out and three dimensional however the pacing of the book felt very off to me for instance vanyel arrives at the court his aunt lives at and most of his first days there are skipped over we cut to a month later and he s getting together with his love interest there s no build up to this point and after sleeping together they immediately declare their love for one another later events make it clear why the r
8273,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,2,this fantasy trilogy is a prequel to the heralds of valdemar trilogy and features the story of the last herald mage some legends of vanyel were told in the heralds of valdemar books but you don t need to have read those books first vanyel is a great character but in this first book he is an annoyingly whiny and self absorbed teenager i guess he is acting his age but it gets tiresome he convinces himself all the time that everybody hates him and so shuts himself off from the world he falls i
8274,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,rereading of an old favorite this is a great series by a wonderful author i can t even say how often i have read/ reread all the valdemir books they are my book equivalent of comfort food i choose this book to be my first audible book because it is so familiar i was unsure i would be able to keep my attention to a book being read to me while on the back of a motorcycle obviously not a place i thought i could read a regular book i found the reader of the book used a very melodramatic voice
8275,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,holy guacamole and frijoles i think this trilogy might end up being my favorite in the entire heralds of valdemar series the plot the characterization the prose the conversations between characters were all so beautiful i love vanyel and all of his friends so much my heart soared and broke in equal measures and i found myself legitimately bawling multiple times due to happiness and sadness and somewhere in between vanyel has such beautiful character development and just this book
8276,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,every time i read a mercedes lackey book i think that s me that s me she understands different types of trauma and defensive behaviors how they emerge and what they re tying to protect the character relationships and interactions is why i read the books they feel real and make me feel understood the plot arc was extremely standard for a valdemar book honestly no surprises i really wish she spent last time on deepening the trauma and more on fixing it magic as cop out but maybe t
8277,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,i wasn t originally reading this book but another of lackey s books when i had the strongest urge to read a few scenes from this book and that turned into an almost all nighter while i read the entire book instead i remember reading it years ago and loving it to death the wow ness has faded but i still enjoyed reading it this time around it seems more of a young adult book than an adult book due to the writing style but the story is entertaining i m reading the second book now and am s
8278,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,this series isn t bad it has an interesting setting and interesting magical conceits and the story was enjoyable there s a lot of good absurd melodrama so if that works for you you might like this despite a gay mc with a major character romantic interest the romance is weirdly not fleshed out there s a lot of they spent lots of time together and not a lot of the author showing us how they spent time together the author in general seems to have an issue with telling instead of showi
8279,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,okay so this review comes from the perspective of a young gay guy i loved it i see others say if was such a surprise it wasn’t first off we hear in other books about vanyel and “tylendel” which doesn’t sound like a feminine name so i knew he was gay and then he was the typical bard lanky and cocky so it was kinda very obvious i don’t understand the people calling him whitney because his life sucks ass when he’s whining he has dealt with abuse and such and when he does find love and
8280,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,2,look i enjoyed the book up until a point i feel like it s a product of its time and as a book initially published in the nums or something i was pleasantly surprised to find that it centered on a young gay man except well it s not exactly the most well written book engaging as it was the writing style felt juvenile and certain narrative choices left me feeling sick in my stomach if you ve read it you know what i mean if not well content warning for suicide and self harm and unable
8281,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,a heartwrenching read that really hit home in how the mcs depression was written so much of this book is tragedy and the plot for most of it is on a small personal scale i love savil as a character and she is by far my favorite in the book her and andel s old familiar relationship was kisses fingers like a chef a good bit of vanyel s development deals with acceptance in the face of social disapproval i just wish so mich of it wasnt couched in tragic circumstances 
8282,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,i didn t want to rate it so highly but i didn t have a choice i first read this years ago on the cusp of coming out to say that it had a tremendous impact on me is an understatement i cried multiple times reading this because there was a lot of sadness to go around yes vanyel is that more special than anyone character but not without a major cost it set him on the right path can t wait to dive into the next book in the trilogy 
8283,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,so good i love this book so much i like how it takes place in it s own magical and creative world i like the morals but how they are there without showing too much in a cheesy way the whole book felt like a puzzle where in the very beginning you have only a few pieces and none of them fit together so you are left trying to figure it out and then getting contradicted as more pieces are added all for the better 
8284,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,honestly i liked it but it was a bog march to get through and a little lacking in direction the protagonist was a total mary sue who laid around healing from one near death experience to another and his romance was so shallowly constructed that i expected the suicide i ll give lackey a break because she published this in num but modern writers be warned i will cut you if you portray us this way 
8285,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,num stars yes i finally finished this book and it got so much better throughout the first num were hella boring but i continued i stopped reading this almost half way through it but recently decided i needed to pick it up again and holly mother was the second half a rollercoaster of angst and angst and just a little more of angst vanyel you poor thing i wish that in the next book something good will happen to you 
8286,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,i really wish i had found this series when i was a teenager magic unicorns gay romance that s me all over however i read it when i was late nums and found it to be painfully melodramatic i couldn t even manage a guilty pleasure out of it just too much angst too many typos to try to look past oh well if the premise sounds interesting read it and decide for yourself 
8287,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,first num pages i enjoyed then really got tired of the main character s self problems and thoughts wasn t until the end did i get interested again wished the author developed the minor characters and expanded more on gifts each had also didn t get into the horses chosen enough i did finish the book 
8288,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,i cannot express enough how much i loved this book i was a bit hesitant when i read the reviews they kept saying that vanyel was whiny i did find him whiny at all harry potter was whinier than him the only reason that i did not give this book five stars is because if the writing the writing was annoying and confusing at times but overall it was a very enjoyable book 
8289,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,it kept me reading until num numam so i feel like i have to give it three stars i would have adored this when i was fifteen i still enjoyed it but now the drama of the plot more than vanyel tbh made me roll my eyes a few times not a too unrealistic portrayal of teenagers though and i appreciated that there were scenes with outsider povs to keep it in perspective 
8290,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,i first read this book many years ago but having found it again on kindle i decided to read it again my opinion then is the same now i really enjoyed the story and it s characters i spent whole afternoons reading over the weekend which i have not done in a long time now rereading the next one 
8291,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,2,num/num of the book is people processing their emotions as internal monologue or with one another unclear if the emotional processing would be less of a slog if vanyel was less whiny and obnoxious i don t think so it s not lackey s best book but it s a classic of gay fantasy best read by preteens 
8292,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,an excellent read with well crafted characters in particular lackey shapes vanyel’s character masterfully and although the angst ridden inner workings of the protagonist’s brain might be too much for some i was completely sold in my opinion vanyel’s relationship with tylendel was the real star of the novel highly recommended 
8293,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,all i could think is why hasn t this book been optioned as a movie my favorite quote from this book is this i think i have learned where there is love the form does not matter and the gods are pleased this i have observed what occurs in nature comes by the hand of nature and if the gods did not approve it would not be there i give you these things as food for your heart and mind 
8294,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,1,a cheesy book about a young man that are misunderstood by his father and send to his aunt there he finds out he is gay and when his lover dies he gets superpowerful magic gifts and a magical horse i did not enjoy it to much of the sexual parts made the story falter and made me skip alot to get to the end the last num pages were ok 
8295,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,magic s pawn was the first book i picked up at the tender age of num and could not put down until i d finished it vanyel s story has been one that i ve read time and again an old favourite a forever friend i highly recommend giving this story a read this story brought about my love of reading and stoked my writing embers 
8296,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,loss grief pain hope and finally redemption and artful beginning to what promises to be an epic tale i look forward to the next book in the series luckily i already have it cued up on my kindle and ready to go 
8297,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,i wanted it to be better but it dragged and the protagonist was painfully annoying until nearly the end i am happy it exists because of the same sex love story and the positive depiction of gay and strong female characters but i guess my hopes were too high 
8298,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,there was a great deal of whining but i suppose this book was set up to show the progress of the main character hopefully the next two books in the series will help me admire rather than just feel sorry for him 
8299,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,definitely reads as an origin story one i really enjoyed i remembered liking the book when i read it as a teenager but wasn’t sure if that would continue i never did read the rest of the trilogy so i’m excited to do that now 
8300,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,i never in a million years would have guessed i would actually read this book let alone absolutely love it it s nothing special really but i couldn t put it down i had to know what s going to happen 
8301,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,2,this started off really super cute but then i realized that no real substantial story was ever going to develope and i couldn t wait for it to end probably will not pick up the next book in the series 
8302,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,this book was as delightfully trashy as i remember it and actually handles a gay protagonist far better than you would expect from a book this age it s fun light fantasy if that is what you are feeling 
8304,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,excellent starter book for those just getting into the heralds of valdemar series as this is the numst book in the heralds timeline good for anyone pre teen and older like all her valdemarian books one i ve enjoyed reading repeatedly over the past num years 
8305,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,not sure what it says about me or the book that while i have completely forgotten the plot i still enjoyed reading it a second time does this make it a good book enjoyable plot or a bad book easily forgotten ಠ ಠ 
8306,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,my heart is so heavy i think it might break my bones and drop to my feet this book tore my heart to pieces and hot glued it back together too many times to count it hurt so bad and i wanted it to stop and never stop at the same time 
8307,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,num num stars i m going to read the whole trilogy eventually 
8308,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,solid fantasy novel and my first look at mercedes lackey s work 
8309,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,gripping stunning reaches into your heart and tears it out while bandaging up and offering it back to you 
8310,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,re read awesome book great series great author 
8311,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,1,the whole series started out promising and the first book leaves at an ok place but i don t really like the way the main character develops at all sorry but not for me 
8312,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,1,yeah no i really didn t like it the mc was whiny the narration was bad i didn t like anything about this book 
8313,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,this book is an enduring favorite of mine and someday i plan to repurchase the entire set again 
8314,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,my only problem with this book was the writing i feel like i couldn’t follow what was happening most of the time but maybe that’s my own careless reading shrug 
8315,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,gay kid s boyfriend screws up and gives him magic powers he doesn t want the powers but he learns to deal with having the powers 
8316,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,listened to this on audible nnarration was a little dull but the storyline was good enough to keep me listening 
8317,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,little bit too much teenage angst in this but the magic is fun 
8318,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,it s the start of one of lackey s best trilogies read it if you love fantasy that is character driven 
8319,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,the last one hundred pages bumped this down a star but oh my gods the romance in this i wish there was more of that because i loved it so much it melted my icy heart and made me squeal so cute 
8320,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,this book hurts in the best kind of way do not read if you are triggered by suicide or suicidal ideation 
8321,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,fantastic novel and start to one of my favorite trilogy i have read this one at least num times 
8322,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,really enjoyed this book definitely a big step up from the first three books 
8323,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,really loved this world and my heart broke right alongside the protaganist’s but i felt kind of dissatisfied at the end a bit rushed still hasn’t put me off heading to book two 
8324,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,2,aside from the odd slut shaming remark here and there only against female characters of course i liked it the writing style just isn t for me though and i found myself struggling to finish it 
8325,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,a magnificent story and extremely well executed 
8326,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,this was my favorite of her series while in middle school and i kept reading and rereading in high school 
8327,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,i really loved this valdemar series when i read it a few years ago 
8329,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4, i couldn t sit here knowing that there were people out there who need exactly the kind of help i can give them and not make the effort to find them and take care of them // as you guys could probably gather if you looked at a list of my favourite books i love me some lgbt and i love me some fantasy so i have made it a life goal to explore as many books as i can that for those two genres and magic s pawn sits nicely in the middle of that venn diagram there were some things that irked me a
8330,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,this book was a slow start very very slow it only hooked me num/num of the way through but i will say this i m glad i kept reading i picked up this book because a friend recommended it and i was determined to consume the whole thing even its tedious parts here s what i didn t like melodramatic if i had a dollar for every time i read oh poor vanyel or great good gods or all my fault or simply every time someone shed tears i could buy the entirety of mercedes lackey s works it was
8331,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,2,almost dnf’d because of the gayngst it rivaled badly written fanfiction levels of gay angst i powered through only to hit the interesting plot stuff at about the num mark 
8332,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,2,i tried reading this because the series crops up a lot in the good fantasy/sci fi books with lgbtq characters despite some negative reviews i thought i d be able to slog through with it boy was i wrong couldn t get past the middle although i d probably like this novel more if i had more free time in my hands i did manage to read twilight when i was younger and unemployed but right now i consider the over blown emotions seriously i mean you re teenagers and you re making these i ll l
8333,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,not sure exactly when i started this one because i was only reading in short spurts on my commute but every time i picked it up i got sucked into it and didn t want to put it down got close to missing my bus stop a few times van was a bit whiny at the beginning and rough around the edges so was hard to listen to but he definitely grew as a character along the way thanks to jean at work for bringing in book one and then promptly bringing in book two 
8334,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4, note i haven t read any of the other valdemar books because i have a love and very deep hate relationship with female protagonists namely being that i rather hate them a lot there are lots of things to like and dislike about this book so your view on the book will depend on how you feel about those things i personally enjoyed the book and give it a good solid num star rating and this is with me jumping into a universe without any prior knowledge of it i liked that this was a real fantasy s
8335,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,1,i picked up this book because i wanted to read a story with an lgbt character in a fantasy setting i thought it would be interesting to see how this type of lifestyle was accepted/challenged in a completely different world what brought me to this book was the high ratings it received and what prompted me to write this review was how misleading i found those ratings to be i will try to write this as spoiler free as possible but there are some minor spoilers about character relationships let s
8336,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,2,originally posted at fantasy literature vanyel ashkevron is miserable at home his father one of the lords of valdemar wants him to be a warrior like the other boys in the family but vanyel who’s more interested in clothes and music wants to be a bard after getting beat up by the armsmaster vanyel is sent to be fostered by his aunt savil who trains valdemar’s herald mages at first he is terrified but soon he realizes that he is finally free to discover the truths about himself he exper
8337,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,magic’s pawn certainly did not disappoint well as far as the gay fantasy aspects of it go the story follows the dreadfully dreary character vanyel as he is abused by his father his teacher and basically everyone who knows him to the point he is emotionally stunted eventually his father throws his hands in the air and ships vanyel off to live with his aunt a powerful and important herald mage there he finds some measure of acceptance acts like a dick and almost kills everyone until he
8338,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,this was a better book in nearly every way it starts out in a similar vein to arrows of the queen under appreciated youth in a remote area of the kingdom is a total misfit and unhappy about it however the characters here are far more complex and the story takes a different turn from the beginning young vanyel is a scrawny musically inclined but not gifted heir of the minor gentry and he is also exceptionally unlikeable lackey s writing throughout this section paints a layered picture o
8339,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,why be a hero a review of magic s pawn the last herald mage series mercedes lackey num sometime in the early nums i got a book club edition copy of the whole last herald mage series in one volume i was already a mercedes lackey fan from her tarma and kethry series i loved this series also and have re read the book many times the central character of the series set in the kingdom of valdemar is vanyel ashkevron the eldest son of a border lord withen ashkevron vanyel a boy of fifteen whe
8340,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,magic s pawn is the first book in the last herald mage trilogy by mercedes lackey and it s one of the books that made me fall in love with fantasy in general this will be a rambling review so please forgive me i m having a hard time trying to figure out what to tell you so you will read it but not too much where you feel you don t need to i guess you could call magic s pawn the discovery phase of the story we are introduced to vanyel ashkevron a spoiled brat of a teenager who has been e
8341,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,2,i m quite indifferent towards this first book in the herald mages series i quickly read the arrows series along with the oathbound series and then the stand alone book by the sword needless to say i was greatly looking forward to reading about the herald mages since their time was years and years before the events in any of the other books i read i should have taken a hint from the small summary on the back of book about vanyel being self centered but the thing is i didn t like him at all
8342,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,1,a revolting insult to the lgbtq community dnf at num i don t normally review books i haven t finished but i d developed quite clear feeling about this one and simply had to share before i start i m a gay man and so my review holds no underlying homophobic elements at all in fact quite the opposite and hope you appreciate my views for the most part the book it fairly well written and lackey s manner is very easy to navigate and absorb but writing aside the rest is just bloody awful i me
8343,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,i loved this loved it okay maybe not a first but after i started getting into the book the annoyances i had at the beginning made sense magic’s pawn by mercedes lackey does seem to have a major polarizing effect with its fans you either love it or you hate it now why did i love it particularly the overall plot line is pretty stupendous a teenage boy obviously at odds with his family’s expectations of what it means to be a man is sent to a distant aunt to “straighten up and be manly ”
8344,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,i was born in num in my small town it was considered enlightened to say something like “i have no issue with gay people but why do they have to rub it in my face by kissing in public ” i was in high school when friends first came on tv and it was considered ahead of its time given it’s “positive” portrayal of ross’s ex wife while incredibly problematic through today’s lens no one was out at my school even ellen degeneres wasn’t out yet in those pre internet days i found book at the libr
8345,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,let me begin by pointing out that i ve seen a lot of reviews that mention the put upon hero or the melodramatic story and magic s pawn is exactly both of them which is exactly why i love it let me add then that i m not usually a fan of drama in this sense i ve never been the sort of reader to cry buckets of tears over doomed love stories lackey definitely improved from her writing adventures in arrows of the queen as vanyel has considerably more personality than talia did and even if
8346,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,this is one of my favourite fantasy novels i re read it every couple of years or so i ve read it now three times i am reviewing it after all this time because i haven t done a review of it yet and because the third book in the series magic s price made a list of recommended award winning lgbtq speculative fiction which i am working through as part of a reading challenge http //blog worldswithoutend com/num mercedes lackey known fondly by her fans as misty wrote this series with
8347,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,this book has a lot of problems i won t say it doesn t certain details that would make me care about the characters and the events seem to be missing the book barrels forward glancing over events that would help you feel more for characters such as the love interest he defends his beliefs about his twin once and then we are told about it until his twin is killed and he goes on a rampage i don t feel like i have really connected to him he doesn t feel like a character he feels like a plo
8348,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,magic s pawn i love all of the series and singles that make up the entire valdemar saga and this one has always been one of my favorites vanyel is a character that i think in some way is a universal character that we can all identify with in one way or another vanyel ashkevron is the eldest son of a rather minor noble in the out country his father is a rigid man believing very firmly in certain things and if you do not fall into his idea of what should be or what is right then you are s
8349,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,vanyel is supposed to be some legendary herald mage but the biggest impression of him in this book is that he cries a lot and is very co dependent savil comes off as super unsympathetic and kind of clueless if she s the herald in charge of trainees then there are major issues this is pre collegium but it doesn t seem that different the students go to class they work with their mentors at some point they do what is essentially a journeyman tour with their mentor and then they earn their

8351,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,vanyel has only one thing he’s ever dreamed of being–a bard unfortunately he’s also the heir to his father’s estate so music isn’t a career that’s in the cards for him he’s too small and fine boned to sword fight like his larger bulkier brothers and cousins but his swordsmaster feels that the fast feint and dash method that would match his build is “cheating ” jervis promptly breaks his arm in punishment for “cheating ” apart from his older sister lissa who is sent away within the first chapt
8352,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,mercedes lackey’s valdemar series provides one of the cornerstones of my reading history after discovering her when quite young i still follow new additions to the series nearly twenty years later i read and re read these books over and over again throughout my youth but i haven t re read this series in its entirety in a long time and never as an adult there are some new books added to the series since the last time i read them so this re reading project is pretty exciting for me since
8353,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,now this this is a book with a teenaged protaganist a young adult novel as it were that reaches deep into the pockets of your soul and nestles there staying with you long after you have closed the back cover i don t know if the last herald mage series is technically ya but if it is then it is fabulous ya and proof that good ya can be just as good adult fiction young vanyel is the oldest son of the cruel and uncompromising lord within and set to inherit his dad s estates but poor va
8354,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,this is one of the most hard hitting books that i’ve read in a long time ever since i read the pact by jodi piccoult actually i think that it probably impacted me so heavily because lackey investigated ideas of depression and not really believing that you are worth the air you breath feelings that i experienced a long time ago this reminded me of those moments but it also reminded me that i got through it and the strength that it can take to overcome such a debilitating illness this book f
8355,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,this was a recommendation from my girlfriend it was a novel she read and enjoyed when she was growing up i have always been a fan of fantasy novels and i saw plenty of ms lackey s books on the shelves but never felt overly compelled to make a purchase well my girlfriend s insistence that i read this particular novel prevailed and now i am writing a review the beginning of this novel really irritated me as it revolved around a character exhibiting a high level of teenage angst now for tho
8356,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,i had this book on my radar for a long time i probably first heard about it when i was around sixteen and i so wish that i had read it back then i am sure it would have resonated with my teenage self haha obviously i still enjoyed it enough to give it num stars but the reason i wish i would have read it back then is because this is a fantasy novel centered on a teenager with very strong teenage themes there s teenage angst young love some moping some nobody understands me moments 
8357,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,i started listening to this audiobook because it was all i had left on my iphone but i m really glad i did i don t know why i skipped this series in middle school when i read just about everything else by mercedes lackey but it s great so far and i wish i d read it sooner 
8358,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,what a great book i really liked it in a mix of genuine enjoyment over a quick engaging read and ironic pleasure at how ridiculous the drama got bless this book i can easily see how it would have been confronting and challenging in the nums even the mid nums i can see plenty of young people having been duly educated by this book about how wrong it is to hate the queer people in your life for something they couldn t help i can see plenty of young people discovering what same sex attractio
8359,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,2,perhaps the most disappointing thing about this book was the back of the book blurb because well pretty much every word of the blurb is a lie when you read it you re filled with a desperate sense of urgency the sense that at the outset of the book vanyel is already extremely powerful and dangerous and gets sent to his aunt so that she main contain his power not so in fact it is no great spoiler to say that half the book passes with vanyel being a simple whiny powerless boy and he is sen
8360,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,1,omg this was awful i don t understand how this book has such a high rating a lot of reviews say that people liked this when they read it as a teen and i guess i might have too because it sounds like a num year old girl writing about her ocs not attractive at this point in my life there are so many things that annoyed me about this book and most of it came down to the author s writing style how has she published so many books first i d say num of this book is long boring fake sounding di
8361,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,1,this book has the rather dubious achievement of being one of the only books i ve finished that i gave a num star rating for here on goodreads it s easily the worst of the last herald mage trilogy in my opinion i would hesitate to pick it up again i loathed vanyel in this book he spends roughly an eternity being an irritating whiny little brat i did not care about him or what happened to him it was not a good way to start off my time with his character lackey might think vanyel and tylendel
8362,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,the heralds of valdemar were my favorite books when i was a teenager and of those this trilogy was my very very favorite i haven t read any of them in years but when cleaning some books out of my dad s house recently i came across these and thought i should go ahead and see what all the fuss was about exactly how good was num year old me s taste well in this particular instance teener christiner was justified this book held up awfully well is it perfect no not at all but good yes 
8363,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,at the risk of an overused metaphor this book is candy very sweet undemanding but not much substance to it i suspect if i d read this book as a teenager i d have loved it and read the rest of the series and defended it against all comers in later life in all honesty for all i m about to lambast it it probably would have made me a better adjusted more openminded person if i had read it as a teen unfortunately i read this one as an adult and whilst i can switch off my brain and enjoy t
8364,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,my favorite thing about this book is how vanyel s arc is more emotional than magical the rising action climax falling action and denouement are all about vanyel learning how to feel and mostly how to express his emotions in a healthy manner you don t see a lot of high fantasies that are more about the hero growing more mentally healthy than more magical or more of a warrior or more of a ruler vanyel is also the most realistic depressed and insecure teenager i ve ever read he cries he

8368,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,4,possible triggers in this book suicide self harm so the description is nothing like the actual book the first part is about vanyel a son unable to please his father or anyone in anything and feels unbelievably alone he gets sent off to his aunt who can help him become manly once there he ends up falling in love and realizing he s gay as hell yes gay protagonist thank you a large amount of this book however is how they live in a society that does not see being gay as natural so vanyel

8372,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,i wanted to like this book i really did and i do like it sort of the characters were interesting the story was fine except for how the blurb on the back of the book had nothing to do with the actual story so everything should be fine right if it weren t for the writing at the start of the book there was nothing wrong with it until the plot really started moving along the three words constantly echoing in my head were the rules that we so early learn when we write fiction show d

8374,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,5,i read this book a while ago and i just loved it it has stuck in my mind since that day and i think of it fondly i found this book very interesting the setting is described beautifully and is very easy to imagine i like the style of writing in these books it doesn t just focus on the action side of the story but also the emotional side too that might not be everybodys cup of tea but i thought it was a nice change from the usual bombardment of blood and fighting you get in so many other b
8375,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,2,i got the book before i heard the spoiler about the main character being gay but i read it anyways because i have a thing for magic/fantasy books and i could care less about a characters sexual orientation to be honest this book was too depressing and annoying to read at times wow this book totally went downhill for me the moment whats his face died i m so over authors who kill off important characters for the sake of being edgy and dramatic you know what s edgy bringing back the dead 
8376,Magic's Pawn,Mercedes Lackey,3,i first read this series in high school and at the time i adored it adored with bells on when i read it then i identified with vanyel i couldn t understand why the adults in his life were urging him to be his own person so much to get some boundaries i d huff angrily about how they didn t understand they just didn t and of course my heart broke and i wept like a child at certain moments re reading it now i identify with vanyel s aunt savil and i m completely on board with all the

8432,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,after re reading the gunslinger for the third time i m issuing an official statement that nobody is allowed to say this is the weakest book in the series from here on out first i m reading the newer num edition that includes an intro from king called on being nineteen which made me cry then i was quickly immersed into mid world with roland my all time favorite literary boyfriend i can t believe how much i ve missed on prior readings it sounds weird but this time i really focused on w
8433,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,the gunslinger the interloper the lord of flies the man in black cometh stephen king our modern day charles dickens takes you on beginning of an epic journey with roland the gunslinger in this poignant tale the story takes us through the past and future and the coming of age of a man and a boy in search of the tower the more you eat the more you toot or should i say the more you re read it the more you will appreciate it that s what i felt second time round reading the novel and al
8434,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,2,“do any men grow up or do they only come of age ” i probably read this wrong full disclosure i would be willing to revisit this after finishing the series maybe it s not often that a book makes me feel truly stupid but this one did i ve heard that it takes a reread after completing the series to get more than a mild dislike out of this book but i ve also heard one shouldn t over analyze and should just go with the flow i ve heard other people found it cryptic while others found it most
8435,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,surprise really is the best way to describe how i felt about this book i devoured this book in less than a day in an afternoon really and i m totally surprised by how much i enjoyed it and joy really is the word i smiled all the way through and here s why i don t know if it was because of my english major background my youthful superiority or my high brow vanity but i had stephen king pegged as a for the thrills no substance writer based on nothing other than my own notions he
8436,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,re read review num/num/num ★★★☆☆ after receiving some private messages and strong encouragement and motivation from trustworthy goodreads members i decided to do my re read sooner rather than later yes i did my re read the very next day i figured the story was fresh and i was doing yardwork rather than paperwork so my change in multitasking duties may make a difference for me it did i actually was able to follow the characters and chain of events as disjointed as they may be at times but i
8437,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,so maybe you ve heard this old story about how to boil a frog you dump a frog in boiling water he s going to jump right out you put cool water in the pot with lil froggie and slowly heat it up while he s inside maybe he won t sit there and boil to death he ll jump out eventually if things get too hot but he s gonna stay in there a good long while if you play your cards right it s a useful little anecdote can be used for all sorts of fun metaphorical purposes for instance i believe i on
8438,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,i m not big into sci fi but this one was better than i expected a little dark a little monochromatic but king does a great job of getting you to understand and believe in his characters this is really a num num/num star novel with num star writing 
8440,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,2,i have heard a lot of hype about this book and a lot of my friends are really into it i saw the paperback cheap at a used book store and decided to pick up the first two in the series i am probably never going to touch the second book i have never been a fan of stephen king i don t really like horror books and i really don t understand how many times you can read about a car killing people before you get bored of the man the reason i read this is because the marvel comic version of this is r
8441,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,2,the man in black fled across the desert and the gunslinger followed as he makes his way across this vast bleak and desolate landscape he meets people has sex forms friendships bullets fly……people die the gunslinger has bad equally bleak and desperate dreams and flashbacks the man in black eludes him for me the best part of this story was the conversation between roland the gunslinger and walter the man in black near the end of this segment of the journey and king’s own afterword no
8442,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,recently my comrades in literature featured a dark tower conversation on prepare for shameless plug shelf inflicted unfortunately i was unable to participate because i had not yet read the series it felt a little like being the uncool kid who gets picked last for kickball i decided it was time to remedy this i was going to prove i could kick that damn ball now i have made vague promises for years to them and to others that yes i would read the book and i was sure that i would love it 
8443,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,“the man in black fled across the desert and the gunslinger followed ” only mr king can compose a book of magic mystery and combine it so well with horror details he s a master story teller and by now i believe he can write just about anything and still make you stare at the book in awe the book starts off with roland stalking the man in black in a black and desolate desert which is the book s setting mostly we have no clue whatsoever about the world we re reading about or the character
8444,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,the dark tower has to be one of the strangest and most mystifying series i’ve read i think probably ever and this review is coming months late—i’ve already read the full series—so i know in it’s entire the book is completely different in style totally unpredictable in plot and simply put just a mesmerizing story the man in black fled across the desert and the gunslinger followed so there lies the iconic first sentence starting stephen king’s immensely famed fantasy series how perfe
8446,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,1,what i learned from this book the gunslinger is the gunslinger the gunslinger slings guns the gunslinger loves to shoot people the gunslinger does this thingie with his fingers to load his guns the gunslinger fucks women when they ask him nicely the gunslinger rolls his own cigarettes the gunslinger takes lsd not because he likes it but because he has to the gunslinger needs to get to the man in black dark tower dark tower dark tower dark tower batwing the gunslinger almost dies the gu
8447,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,a fair introduction to my very first stephen king novel the gunslinger is a mix of tolkien s grandeur and the western elements of the good the bad and the ugly the first volume of the dark tower is a maze of pretty vocabulary quite hard to get into at first ironically mr king himself said that the revised editions are easier to read imagine how far more difficult it would have been to read the original text it is gushing with bizarre characters scattered on a labyrinthine narrative des
8448,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,i’ve always heard great things about this series so when my bestie and her brother invited me to do a buddie read i jumped on i so glad i did i had to remind myself to keep plugging along “i’m sure this will become clearer as i go ” and it did not that there aren’t questions about the bigger picture but for this particular book i’m satisfied but that’s why it’s a series right 
8449,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,2,well it s unfortunate that this was my first stephen king book i ve seen so many of the movies adapted from his books so i was well aware that he has a different imagination but this was just weird and not very enjoyable for me it was dark emotionless and vague i know this is the weakest of the series king admits it himself in the foreward but it s highly doubtful i will continue on a positive note there s a movie adaption to be released some time this year so there s that at least 
8450,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,1,ok so i ve always thought stephen king was wonderful however i can t see it in this book like a weird guy on drugs wrote it i don t think i ll try the rest of this series 
8451,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,“the man in black fled across the desert and the gunslinger followed ” and so it begins i have ventured along the path of the beam many a times with roland the dark tower series is one of my all time favorites and it is hard to review the gunslinger as a stand alone book but i will try i had attempted to read the gunslinger num times… that’s right you read that correctly i loved stephen king and could not understand why i couldn’t get through this book i would get to the same point every ti
8452,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,i feel very very guilty about my num years of smug dismissal of stephen king it took gr friends with impeccable taste in lit to show me the errors of my ways mr king i apologize you really know how to write a brilliant page turning story i read this book aloud to the misses and it was only the second book i ve read to her that she simply wouldn t let me stop the other hyperion the rich relatable and broken characters the unfolding world that seems recognizable but isn t poignant wr
8453,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,i loved this book it got me hooked on the series re read num/num/num num/num/num i had forgotten how much this book foreshadows the series all the clues to the ending were right there from the beginning it really was brilliant to have those seeds planted so early before the other books were even fully formed i may need to re read the whole series now 
8454,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,how does one even being to rate much less review stephen king s magnum opus if one rates it highly can one be sure they are not rating it for what it is instead of for the words themselves or if one rates it lowly can one be sure that is not just the same reaction in the opposite direction where expectations have soared so high heaven itself could not satisfy so let us instead speak of simpler things than trying to sway you into making this an inclusion on your tbr shelf the man in bla
8455,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,i read this at the age of num a little young one might say but i was always precocious and my family threw adult fantasy/science fiction at me from all sides not that i minded i always caught the books but i hadn t been so immersed in a book since the lord of the rings and was so fascinated by what my friend had given me she had introduced me to stephen king not as the lord of horror but as the lord of dark fantasy and i am still entranced to this day thanks again gabe for introduci

8459,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,this book is a very odd book and i find stephen king s writing style strange it is not what i expect i expect the gunslinger book is more serious mystery dark and the plot of the storyline in the book is more mature i didn t like the main character i wonder how the story lead to the dark tower i don t really enjoyed this book but i find the world in the dark tower really intriguing 
8460,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,a long overdue reread of one of my favorite stephen king novels this was the fantasy selection of the month for my local book club and even though the later novels have a decent mix of sci fi and horror thrown in this first novel is set firmly in fantasy/western territory so it fits our established genres also most of the book club members had not yet read this one and we wanted to rectify that oversight before the movie was released and though we got decidedly mixed reviews within the g
8461,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,beyond the reach of human range a drop of hell a touch of strange stephen king considers the dark tower series his greatest achievement he started the epic in his youth and worked on it for most of his literary career readers in general agree with him and are generous with their praise for the gunslinger who chases the man in black in a long winded essay plus introduction to the revised edition the author tries to explain both his enthusiasm for the subject and the desire to create a
8462,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,2,i have not enjoyed reading this book it just felt bitty and disjointed i have heard the rest of the series is better but with many books to read they will have to wait for the distant future 
8463,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,so first of all this is a re read for me as some might have noticed i just finished re reading the stand and planned to take a short break and then re read the dark tower series well last weekend i noticed my buddy edward lorn starting a buddy read on the dt series on his discussion group and so i just had to dive right in i want to give edward a shout out first and say that this has been a double pleasure not only reading one of my all time favorite series but being able to chat about
8465,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,story time when i was in college my husband and i went to the grand teton s and yellowstone for num weeks while we were at the giftshop in yellowstone i believe i found the gunslinger on one of those spinning racks stephen king is my favorite author so i immediately grabbed the book and bought it that night i read the first page and thought ew the main character is a cowboy i put the book down and never picked it back up well num years later i decided to try again and boy am i happy i di
8466,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,2,this just didn t work for me i was never able to get into this book as i was somewhat confused during the entire novel and the whole thing felt like a vague hazy dream i feel like there was some sort of underlying metaphor i was suppose to get and connections that i was suppose to make that i just didn t looking forward to the next one since it sounds like it s easier to read 
8467,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,a fairly spare story for king took me two tries to get into it 
8468,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,i read the first half of this when i was in seventh grade i bought over a dozen stephen king books at a garage sale and laid out a plan to complete the entire stephen king catalogue this was even more foolish than my more recent attempt to read the entirety of in search of lost time in one year not of course that it can’t be done only that i have proven myself—over and over again—incapable of following through with my grandiose plans however comparatively to others’ modest they may be i
8469,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,buddy read with the lovely kat set to commence tomorrow review time oops i did it again i expected too much i wanted an epic beginning oh deary deary oops my expectations were too high i wanted a masterpeice from num year old mr king the gunslinger is a solid three for me not a because i m being nice or it was relatively inoffensive three but merely because he bit off more than he could chew in num pages in my opinion don t get me wrong it was good i just had so hoped it woul
8470,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,opening this book and returning to this world was like slipping on my oldest comfiest and most loved sweater it felt like coming back home after being away for entirely too long and it brought back so many memories i could almost see exactly where i was and how i felt when i first fell in love with these books and the magical world contained within and this time around was just as magical if not more so there s so much to take in and absorb from this story on your first read through that y
8472,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,slightly less enjoyable fifth time around i ve come to hate the final scenes of this book i understand the subtext and the foreshadowing and blah blah blah but it s just not enjoyable to read this coming from someone as i just said who s read it five times still the battle of tull the fight with the slow mutants and jake s fate will remain close to my heart forevermore this extended prologue to the series might ve finally worn out its welcome with me the best part about this time aro
8473,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,the gunslinger review the man called noon meets the fellowship of the ring by a nineteen year old horror author this is the third time i ve read the gunslinger the first time i was young younger than i like to remember and a great deal of this book was lost on me the second time i read it was in num after king finished the series by releasing the final three books in a marathon sprint my views of the second read and this read through are about the same  i have a clear favorite in this
8474,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,2,rather than a standalone book i view this more of a long prologue to the series i learned a lot about the gunslinger and his history my only problem with the book and let s face it it was a pretty big problem to lose two stars over is the confusing writing king is creative his stories are engaging but sentences were choppy and he kept jumping from topic to topic without any conclusion i was left wondering what exactly happened in some instances eg demon baby moment as a prologue
8475,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,the gunslinger is unlike anything i have ever read upon reading the gunslinger i really did not know what the dark tower series was about and the first installment to the dark tower series really gives you an idea of who the gunslinger is how he sets out on this journey and finally what his mission is i really enjoyed several parts in this book i ve seen a lot of negative criticism about the gunslinger and quite honestly i m the type to give a book a chance and not let anyone else s fe
8479,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,let me say something first there s really no point in reading any stephen king story if you don t read the dark tower series first i m very serious about this every short story every sentence in one of his huge novels will resonate so much more if you read these novels outright because king is a geek of the best kind he writes for his fans who are as obsessed if not more with the world of the dark tower and so every story has a shout out whether it be momentary or whether it prac
8481,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,num i loved the subtle world building that king did in the gunslinger he plops us down in roland s world and gives us little bits of info here and there to piece together where he is he shows us a world with a long history not unlike ours but more parallel than linear i love the idea of a world moving on a bit like the heavyside lair or tolkien s idea for his worlds it verges on high fantasy but also has bits of reality western horror almost everything we see roland in a very unf
8483,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,there was pressure to read this one or i should say instead the gentle urges from one of my best friends john gugie rip love you always i hadn’t gotten around to grabbing them and giving them a go until one night in a friend’s apartment where ronnie proudly displayed the whole collection on his shelf raved enthusiastically on the series merits and then sent me on my merry way with the entire series on loan i cannot remember or think about this series without remembering john’s discussi
8484,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,so i read this a couple weeks ago and am only just now getting around to writing the review i m a little surprised at my rating i wasn t in love with this one i watched the movie when it came out this summer and while i didn t think it was anything exceptional it felt like a better rendition of king s work than so many other movies based on his books i guess the misunderstanding on my part was that the movie covered all of the dark tower books while i m sure there are many wonderful parts o
8485,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,the gunslinger by stephen king is the first king novel that i ve read i thought i d start with this one because i wanted to read a fantasy book by him and this series is so highly rated by a lot of you i know a lot of you warned me that the book is confusing and i thank you for that because if i hadn t known that many of you also found it hard too i might have given up on the book at first i was really liking the gunslinger we start off by meeting the gunslinger roland whilst he is in the m
8487,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,this book has unexpected depth for me at least this was my first book by stephen king so maybe this is normal for him i am talking about the multi layered way of writing and story telling the way the world is described and created is well done and often by stories the gunslinger tells others the sentences are holding so much that i had to reread them multiple times more than once and i am sure i still didn t get everything i like that there are still so many things unclear and not everything
8488,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,first king book i ve managed to finish and it was ok 😕🤷 i didn t think it was bad but i wasn t really wowed does this series get better or should i prepare myself for more of the same 
8490,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,num/num the opening paragraph to the gunslinger was so embedded into my mind already purely down to a number of friends/other reviewers on goodreads that a metaphorical shiver went down my spine when it was finally my time to read it and begin the journey to the tower by no means is this a perfect novel or even one of king’s better outings from the few i’ve read but it is the promise of what is to come which adds to the enjoyment here instantly you are drawn into roland’s quest and quickly give
8491,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,i can officially say that i ve read a book by stephen king if you re wondering i committed a sin in the eyes of a book lover i watched the film before i read the book i know right that s totally not me at all the reason why i did was because i know how many mixed reviews the beginning of this series gets i didn t know whether i d be motivated to read and proceed with this series if i didn t have interest in the world that is why i chose to watch the movie beforehand i went into it with no
8492,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,two good things george guidall the narrator has the perfect voice for the gunslinger he has the gravel of too many cigarettes and too much bourbon but along with the roughness of his vocal cords is an ability to feel the text and convey that feeling making the story of such unrepentantly awful characters something i wanted to hear even though i can t give a shit about them stephen king s fantasy epic set in something resembling our world contains the kind of sprawling insane mythology t
8493,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,this was my second time reading the novel i was a teenager at my first go i enjoyed it much more this time around could not put it down actually i read it in a num hour span it s making me want to revisit all of king s work i think i may do just that playlist hey jude the beatles onward christian soldiers shall we gather at the river robert lowry the rain in spain my fair lady a song by the rock group kiss careless love madeleine peyroux ease on down the road michael jackson a hundred l
8494,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,[re read] the epic dark tower series book num the quest to the dark tower begins here roland the only left gunslinger follows the dark man to find answers to the questions of his past which are all connected to finding the dark tower which is a nexus that holds all the worlds that exist in the universe together check it out folks jake chambers was a nice treat character too that you will feel obsessed with 
8495,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,this book deserves num stars just for the opening line this fantasy western is short but not an easy read 
8496,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,most people when they consider the dark tower as a whole often think of it in terms of being perhaps the height of achievement in stephen king s career and while i can count many favorites among king s seemingly endless bodies of work i m inclined to agree the man in black fled across the desert and the gunslinger followed of course one must take into consideration some of his most notable works such as the shining it the stand and even some of his bachman books the dark tower stil
8497,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,roland of gilead the last gunslinger is on a mission to track the man in black whom he thinks will be able to tell him where the dark tower is he journeys through a desert wasteland encountering others along the way including jake a boy who has seen the man in black in a previous life and travels with the gunslinger as he closes in on his quarry this was a bit hard to get into at first and it wasn t til the story of tull that i became a lot more invested in the read roland is a complex cha
8498,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,my impression of stephen king s magnum opus the gunslinger went through the entire gamut of human emotions my initial feelings were as follows confusion utter and total confusion yet it had a cool vibe so i felt compelled to continue then sprinkle on some happiness sorrow further confusion boredom and indifference blend thoroughly with awe surprise additional confusion inspiration confusion massive excitement and hope finish with confusion it was a short read and my friends ha
8499,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,this is probably the most difficult book review i will ever have to write i want to recommend this and tell you all to read it but this book is hard it s hard to make sense of hard to get into so i recommend this to you with my highest praise but i m warning/advising you stick with it it will be worth it in the end i promise anyhow to my review i ve read the dark tower series before this series and i have a history i read the first num books and then i went back to the start and rea
8500,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,to be honest i’ve never been a big fan of stephen king i’ve always felt that he’s a far better storyteller than an actual writer and this book does little to change that opinion in fact the book’s prose style seems even clumsier than king’s usual mostly adequate standard given the fact that the book started out as a fix up novel consisting of num short stories published between num and num it stands to reason that it would suffer a bit from a young writer’s inexperience the narrative is
8501,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,e/t/a amazon is marketing this as serial killer fiction i m not sure whether i find that hilarious or if it makes me want to cry this is my least favorite chapter of the dark tower saga it s written in a completely different style probably mostly because it was written when king was num and the others much later and i prefer the rest of the books to it that being said this is still an all consuming book and will suck in the reader from the very beginn
8502,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,intriguing i know this is the first of seven books so there is still a lot of story left but i m hooked so far in the forward stephen king says this is his lord of the rings and it definitely is a fantasy but it still has that king flavor of horror which makes me happy i look forward to the drawing of the three update num/num/num i m sticking with four stars as a devoted fan of sk i m aware that i ve just taken the first couple of steps on what promises to be a magical journey but at t
8504,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,2,well the jury s still out on this one but my overall impression was uh i decided to read this book because one of the executive producers of lost which i love loved this series and i tend to like the fantasy quest type thing so i had high expectations for stephen king s dark tower series but this book was weird and icky there was a lot of sex in this book that i found completely unnecessary unenjoyable and kind of gross and the protagonist is not particularly sympathetic 
8505,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,2,ok so i know this is supposed to be some great work of king s however i really had a hard time getting into this i m not a fan of westerns for starters i frequently felt like i didn t know what was going on not until the end did it seem to become interesting i ll likely finish the series because of all the connections to other works of king though 
8508,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,note this was my very first review on booklikes the gunslinger is definitely an oddity in stephen king s list of written works it s trippy cold and a bit confusing for newcomers to the dark tower series king s typical style is more warm and inviting comparable to a longtime friend putting his arm around your shoulder and telling you a tale you just gotta hear the first novel in the dark tower sequence isn t like that thus it tends to be rather divisive in stephen king fan communities 
8509,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,i know that it s taken me a long time to get around to this book i can explain back when wizard and glass came out i was on a major king spree i read nothing but king for over three months nearly everything he d written to that point i overdosed and i excused passing over this series because it wasn t finished yet maybe king would get hit by a van and wouldn t be able to finish it since then king has both been hit by a van and finished the series so i have no excuse and after reading
8510,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,the chief influence for cthulhu armageddon the gunslinger remains arguably my all time favorite novel it is strange because it is not actually as detailed as most of stephen king s work instead it is a long dream like work which opens on an alien but familiar world that has elements of the wild west mixed with fantasy but also our world it is a classic tale of archetypes with roland the gunslinger on a mission of revenge against the man in black along the way he ll do horrible things whil
8511,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,2,the imagery in this novel is awesome the bulk of the story is in a western style post apocalyptic desert there s saloons gun fights and creepy abandoned towns the gunslinger also had flashbacks that took us to some kind of medieval style fantasy world and we even meet a character that took us back to current time new york i couldn t figure out how they all fit together though i spent most of this story trying to piece together details to help me figure out the plot roland the gunslinger 
8513,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,num num stars rating subject to change because i loved this book but i don t think i should give it five stars so there are two reasons i m happy to finish this book one it was really fabulous and i loved every single second of it two i can stop getting tom petty s two gunslingers stuck in my head every time i notice it in my audible app the imagination and bizarre mix of mythology/science/world building in this book were truly remarkable and a bit eclectic i was surprised more than a
8514,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,2,the universe is the great all and offers a paradox too great for the finite mind to grasp as the living brain cannot conceive of a nonliving brain—although it may think it can—the finite mind cannot grasp the infinite the prosaic fact of the universe’s existence alone defeats both the pragmatist and the romantic i wonder and then some i am still wondering nope no clue it was clearly not my cup of tea it doesn’t have anything to do with the content i guess and those num stars are just my individu
8515,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,2,the gunslinger said nothing the boy said nothing the gunslinger was silent thoughtful the man in black was silent for a while the gunslinger made no reply thomas failed once again to see the greatness of this book parts are brilliant of course the time spent in and especially the killing of tull is very effective storytelling and riveting reading the world building is often good even if i like it better when very little is revealed rather than when things get more explained but most els
8516,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,1,it may surprise some that i m giving stephen king a one star review but i thought about it and i have to be fair if any other author had written this i probably would have stopped reading it before the end and would have had no problem giving it one star because it was king i rushed through the ending just so i could be done with it i found this book poorly written and the plot pointless a gunslinger is hunting a man in black so obviously he s evil in a land where they sing hey jud
8519,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,num num out of num stars i was unsure whether to round this to num or to num because i didn t exactly love this book yet i still liked it in the end i decided to give it a num because at times it was tedious but nonetheless good if you re a fan of western like stories fantasy and stephen king this might be right up your alley 
8520,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,1,listen i consider myself a pretty good reader context clues reading comprehension vocabulary and i always got invited to the pizza hut accelerated readers pizza party in elementary school 😂 but i have no idea what i just read honestly i only sort of figured this book out today after watching a num second trailer for the movie 
8522,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,num/num i thought the pacing of this was slow sure there were periods of furious activity the battle of tull etc but as soon as they were over it was back to stolidly plodding along in terms of both pace and what was happening in the plot i felt confused for most of the num pages of the book and was left with many many questions some admittedly were a bit stupid but i just didn t get what was happening in the scenes while i was reading them exactly what was a gunslinger what was
8523,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,the man in black fled across the desert and the gunslinger followed right to be perfectly candid this is really not a five star book far from that it s more like a num num or so same goes for the final installment in the series which features the most fucked up dullest stupidest crappiest ending ever [ ] the dark tower the series i mean is all about the journey and the journey itself is a pretty amazing one hence the five star rating given this is the beginning of a spectacular
8524,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,1,i very much enjoyed stephen king when i was in high school and after picking up “num/num/num last year” i was positively surprised to see my esteem for him has not diminished as an adult on top of that i have been told for years what a wonderful series “the dark tower” is so i was very excited to finally have the time to commit myself to reading it but after forcing myself to get through the first instalment i have to say this is the most disappointing book i have probably ever read i reall
8525,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,this review and others can be found on bw book reviews on thanksgiving chantel and i watched rogue one together while you might think that us watching a movie together had nothing to do with this book it does i hated that movie i made chantel laugh by thanking the bad guys for killing people off that movie had a pointless plot there were no compelling characters i knew no names and it took ages to get to the point much like this book while it s only num pages for my copy it took me so
8526,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,2,this read turned out to be a lot tougher to get through than i had thought it would be considering the small size of the book this was my first king book and although i found it to be enjoyable whilst i was reading it i as left with a hundred questions which increased as the book went on which ended up slightly putting me off picking it back up once i had put it down i liked the character of roland he seemed to have a clear goal and be a very direct person i felt that he was likeable and dis
8527,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,i approached this series with some trepidation because it s a bit of a commitment and i have long standing issues with commitment i ve gone some way to curing that by managing a semblance of dedication when it comes to grrm s a song of fire and ice series or got if you will although that said the last two books in the series are currently languishing unread at the side of my bed there are quite a lot of books in the series i believe the count now stands at six and also there are many peo
8528,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,numnd read num num stars review to come i have mixed feelings on this book though i am happy that i started the series it wasn t the best first book out there the plot and the way the story was told was confusing at times we would go between past and present and i did not care for hearing about his past events i found them quite dull to be honest i liked the main character but didn t love him i feel like i didn t form an attachment to him that well i really liked the boy jake thou
8529,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,1,this one really wasn t for me i found it confusing and it didn t flow i didn t hate it but there were far too many occasions when i really had no clue as to what was going on or what the actual story was supposed to be about i ve said before that i m not a fan of overly descriptive passages and this book has them in abundance i often got the impression that the author had a thought and then threw the words onto the page it certainly read that way to me i really hope that the other books
8530,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,that was an odd read—not bad just odd like king just threw in any old idea he came up with and didn’t bother editing later i could appreciate that he chose the western form to jolt readers away from comparisons with donaldson’s thomas covenant or brooks’ shannara series but make no mistake this is a quest tale not searching for the holy grail but seeking the black tower the symbolism is all over the place—lots of biblical references tarot a few to king arthur probably some that went ri
8531,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,well i don t know what to think of the gunslinger although i also cannot think of a rating other than four stars it would have been a five if the sacrifice had been more gory and more sanguine instead of being disappointing and underwhelming now i know that stephen king is an author who thrives in death his least bloody book that i ve read dolores claiborne was a letdown the lack of magic in that book did not help now i know the second and third books in this series are better than th
8532,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,i am full of questions many many loose ends unclear and confusing a mystery surrounding a man that may be a real person who exists or does he or is he many different men as far as i can tell he is a good man who is chasing his nemesis a man in black because he must a bit of biblical reference and on the other end of the spectrum tarot cards and space science thank goodness this is a buddy read and i am not the only one left with questions or simply crazy for wanting to go on with t

8534,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,reread july num i ve been meaning to re read the series as for some reason the story didn t stick with me through all these years num if my memory serves me right so the journey began when king was very young and this clearly shows in his writing still i found it a perfect kick off for what i consider one of the best fantasy stories ever told 
8535,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3, num num out of num stars i ve read my fair share of stephen king novels but this one was by far the strangest riddled with odd arrangements of sentences and weird descriptions the gunslinger was at times incredibly hard to follow however that amazing ending and the hope that the rest of the series will be better is pushing me to pick up the second installment 
8537,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,first book in the dark tower series it serves as an introduction to the tale to come sets the mood and introduces the hard hitting main character the gunslinger i really liked the book but the best is yet to come make sure you read the rest of the series

8543,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,i have to admit it when i started reading this one i wasn’t so sure i was going to finish it in fact in the foreword to this new revised edition the author mentions that he felt the urge to often apologize to readers for the way the first edition of the gunslinger was written saying it did not sound like the later books encouraging them to be perseverant and keep on reading a story that would only find its voice in the following books of course he was talking about the non revised firs
8544,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,this is going to be a short review with random thoughts i can’t seem to organize my thoughts about this book king does a great job laying the groundwork to open this seven book series the gunslinger may be a short novel but it’s packed full of vivid imagery and a blend of unique characters my version of the paperback had num pages consisting of five long chapters honestly i was expecting more to happen and at times the book felt longer there were a few exciting action packed scenes invol
8546,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,1,aw shit that is my first thought after reading this i have a future discussion to lead about this book which i nominated well at least i can watch idris elba next year playing roland ok there are too many genres rolled into one here the stories are jumbled parallel worlds the midworld is already too much and confused me alot plus too much travelogue for my taste despite some admittedly beautiful proses it was mostly dreary and cathartic as for characters i did not develop any affi
8547,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,i can t tell you how many times i ve read this book it s a lot i can tell you that the first time i read this i was so very very confused my mum and my brother were both reading the series and they convinced me to keep going it sounds very generic to say i m glad i did but i am if i had to rate this book without knowing the details of the rest it would probably get num stars num because it s stephen king and the other because it has potential and lordy does it have potential but i have r
8549,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,i was warned by many people that this book is difficult and work getting through in order to get into the series which is apparently fantastic i didn t find this book difficult but it sure is odd i had to keep reminding myself that this is a stephen king book and not neil gaiman i can see how stephen king has such a huge following i avoided his work for many years as i don t read horror but every book of his that i have read has been amazingly well written great characters well craf
8551,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,a decade ago i tried this book on audio and had to dnf because i just couldn t get into it but after hearing so many great things about the dark tower series i finally decided to give it another go this time the reworked version in the foreword king states he made the text more readable more accessible by cutting out all the unnecessary parts that were a reflection of his younger self s more literary ambitions motive he felt it was such a shame many people never got into the series be
8552,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,congrats to me for finishing this time so if you re a king fan which i definitely am you re supposed to read this series the trouble is you have to start with this book which is boring as all hell still it picks up about halfway through and becomes not exciting but intriguing i m ready for more 
8553,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,2,well that was an utter disappointment

8556,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,num num of num stars never would ve guessed this was written by king a bit convoluted and hard to follow wondering if it would have been different if i had read the revised version instead glad to have finally started this though and definitely plan to continue maybe not right away though 
8557,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,2,two stars may seem harsh but it s all relative and a two starred king book is still better than many other books i ve read that said the gunslinger certainly does not rank highly on my list of king novels to better understand why i didn t enjoy this book i had to do a bit of research on the history of the first of the dark tower novels this helped shed some light on why i didn t enjoy this read very much brief history lesson on the first dark tower novel the gunslinger it took stephen k
8558,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,the gunslinger aside from beginning with one of the greatest first sentences in the history of literature and something even more amazing the gunslinger is the gateway to the dark tower series and at the same time it is a source of confusion wonder anger and all the rest my belief is that this is because the gunslinger is not really a novel it’s a prolog king himself in his intro to the updated version of the book says that the dark tower is really one long novel so the gunslinger is
8559,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,“the man in black fled across the desert and the gunslinger followed ” i have to start by saying this is my second read through of the dark tower series my second journey to the tower is somehow even more enjoyable than the first i’m thrilled i waited until my second read through to properly review the series especially the gunslinger confusing parts made so much more sense and there are so many hints and subtle clues to what happens later in the series of course i had to choose the most l
8560,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,2,i m a fan of king s horror the shining is one of the best horror novels i ve ever read this this was something i just couldn t get into the gunslinger has one of the strongest opening lines i ve seen in modern fiction the man in black fled across the desert and the gunslinger followed it s stark spare and evocative it is i think written to mirror king s ideas for his main character unfortunately the rest of the book can t match its opening line and the character of roland can t
8561,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,“do any men grow up or do they only come of age ” or for that matter do they even come of age some boys never learn to be men steven spielberg for example but that s irrelevant unless roland the titular gunslinger fails to learn anything through the remaining num main volumes and num half volumes stephen king has set it all up right from the first short story for this series to be an epic multiple genre blending bildungsroman but do i care enough to carry on probably not to be honest i have
8562,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,as i began making my way through king s entire catalogue back when i was num or so i remember always skipping past the dark tower series because the premise never really appealed to me not only that but that strange mutt genre mix of western/horror/fantasy did not sound especially inviting to a boy mostly steeped in science fiction written by bear and benford fast forward about num years or so and i have finally decided to read the gunslinger even after all the warnings that this book was sort
8563,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,pretty underwhelming to me for a celebrated series from a celebrated author perhaps it s because it was written when king was still young or perhaps it s the nature of it as an origin story will proceed to the numnd book to decide whether it s really my cup of tea or not
8564,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,initially i was fearful to write a review so much has already been said about this book and being a newby to the series i didn t want to mess up any thoughts for fear of others telling me i m wrong i will just write a few words on my reaction to this book i found parts of it extremely slow and confusing it jumps around in time and events and i just couldn t grasp where it went and where it was going at first i didn t understand who anyone was or what the point of the chase was and who wa
8565,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,phew i’m done yep finished reading my first ever stephen king novel the gunslinger it was a bit of a chore as i found it a little difficult to follow but that could have been my fault due to my mind wandering to all the many lovely fun and festive books i could’ve been reading even so if it had of kept my interest i guess my mind would not have wandered nevertheless i did plod on as in some parts it became interesting and i could appreciate stephen king’s great writing and i did want to
8566,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,overall this book was mostly what i was expecting it to be a very long prologue so dont get me wrong i really enjoyed it i liked roland as a character and i enjoyed reading about his search for the man in black his interactions with jake and the parts of his backstory which were interluded a few times within the book however i already heard from a lot of people that this first book would make perfect sense in retrospect when you finish the series but that it would feel mostly like an in
8567,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,the opening volume to king s fantasy opus could be looked upon as little more than a prologue to the epic tale that followed but it remains one of my favourite entries in the series knightly gunslinger roland is the product of an alternative feudal america now fallen into a state of terminal decline for reasons unknown roland chases the man in black across this wasted landscape encountering predatory elementals and religiously deranged townsfolk along the way roland is a compelling an often
8568,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,2,a thoroughly uninteresting and unsatisfying book honesty i only finished it because a i m curious to read the rest of the series since i ve heard so many good things and b i had no other audiobooks to listen to on my lengthy commute this is the second king novel i ve tried and i still can t shake the small dingy american town feel it s bleak as hell but not even good bleak i did not care what was happening in the story for most of the novel it was confusing and experimental to the detrim
8569,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,this is by no means the strongest volume in the series nor my favourite think the hobbit in comparison to the rest of the lord of the rings but i gave it five stars anyway because it is the book that launched roland on his unforgettable addictive quest it s a teaser but absolutely integral to understanding everything that comes after don t miss that experience and my absolute favourite opening line say it with me constant readers the man in black fled across the desert and the gu
8571,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,i see a lot of complaining that it s slow and blah blah blah and that s valid but it s short and you have to read it in order to continue with one of the greatest series ever written so blah blah blah keep reading it gets way better long days and pleasant nights 
8574,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,wow it s been a while since a book has left me in such a confused state i ve been aware of the dark tower series for years but having found its epic ness and length intimidating i have only now made the move to read its first volume but what the hell was it that i have just read we follow the journey of roland of gilead also known as the last gunslinger he is a loner on a mission to track down the man in black and ultimately find the dark tower on his travel through desolate world we fo
8575,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,1,now this is a book with a really neat premise a promising world and potential for a heart wrenching character relationship and a mysteriously awesome villain but it fell so short what a letdown to start let me just say that when your creative writing num teacher tells you to avoid flashbacks as much as possible because it slows down the forward motion of the story you should probably listen not that i always hate flashbacks but this book is a shining example of how not to use them i m
8577,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,3,well that was an odd read one good thing about this first book in the epic dark tower series is that its mercifully short i must agree with king in the foreword to this edition when he wrote when i looked back at the first volume which you now hold in your hands three obvious truths presented themselves the first was that the gunslinger had been written by a very young man and had all the problems of a very young man’s book the second was that it contained a great many errors and fals

8579,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,to say this book was a watershed for me is an understatement it literally changed the way i read how i read and i probably wouldn t write at all if not for reading it the gunslinger is the first in the dark tower series which not only consists of the seven books in the series but also has ties to a great many of sk s other books it s not horror nor is it science fiction it s dark dantasy at its very best and it will by turns make you laugh cry scream in frustration and probably throw
8580,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,5,at my former job i sat at the lunch table in the cafeteria with a bunch of colleagues i was just starting to love fiction and had just finished tolkien’s legendary trilogy i asked a fellow reader “what do you think about the dark tower series ” he looked at me for a minute then finally told me what he thought it was ka man of all the people i could have asked i asked one of the biggest fans of the series he said he reads it over and over and over again at least once a year he told me
8581,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,i am not a fan of stephen king s writing though i am a fan of the man so i have purposefully stayed away from the dark tower series king s books always seem to follow a simple pattern with me the first third of the book i find myself excited joyfully surfing the book on the wave of king s pure inventiveness no matter how i feel about his books in the end it is hard to deny that his crazy mind is full of interesting ideas in the second third of the book the wave invariably begins to los

8583,The Gunslinger,Stephen King,4,i am trying to open myself up to new things for a long time i didn’t read science fiction or fantasy as i didn’t see them as “my kind of thing” whatever that means anyone who peers at my reading history over the last four years or so will note that i have a clear love of genre fiction but i have decided recently to broaden my horizons so i read peter hamilton’s void trilogy last year held the attention but had a rushed ending and now i’m tacking that big part of stephen king i’ve alw
